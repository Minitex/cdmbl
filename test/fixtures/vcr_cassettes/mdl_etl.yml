        In this interview, Mayeron-Cowles discusses her childhood; ceramics education;
        her introduction to the pottery community in Minnesota; and her thoughts on
        the past, present and future of the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour. This interview
        was conducted by local oral historian and PhD Candidate from the University

        art enthusiasts from across the country. Together the project''s ten oral
        history interviews, representing diverse perspectives from within the local
        pottery community, tell the story of how, from the 1950s to today, Minnesota\ufffds

        housewife\u2014went to every performance and soccer\ngame that we ever had
        and always had all meals on the table. My father was a civil engineer so\nhe
        planned water and sewage systems in Minneapolis and ultimately in places out
        of the\ncountry\u2014Africa, Peru. I grew up with someone that was very in
        tune with math.\nAW: Did he travel a lot?\nCMC: Yes.\nAW: Did you ever get
        to go with him?\nCMC: No, but my parents believed in traveling so we would

        you went while you were growing up?\nCMC: We went to the Caribbean. We went
        to Hawaii. We went all around the United States. A\nlot of car trips in the
        United States. Went to Mexico, went to Europe, New York\u2014well, that\u2019s
        the\nUnited States. I don\u2019t know, things like that.\nAW: Did you enjoy

        I went to camp in Northern Minnesota.\nAW: Part of a Y camp?\nCMC: No, it
        was a girls\u2019 camp [Camp Lake Hubert for Girls]. A Catholic girls\u2019
        camp but I\nwasn\u2019t Catholic.\nAW: Did you go there often?\nCMC: I went
        there for a month in the summer for about five or six years.\nAW: What was
        it like up there?\nCMC: It was like this, in the woods. We sailed, we shot
        guns, we rode horses.\nAW: Where did you go to school?\nCMC: Public high school,
        St. Louis Park. I\u2019m part of the baby boomer generation so my\ngraduating
        class had about eight hundred students.\nAW: Did you have any experiences
        with pottery or ceramics during that time?\nCMC: No, absolutely not. Didn\u2019t
        know it existed.\nAW: What were your favorite subjects to study?\nCMC: I didn\u2019t

        to have careers. They were supposed to be married and have\nchildren. I loved

        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n4\nAW:
        How long were you out there?\nCMC: I was there for three years. It was during
        the Vietnam War and it was when a lot of\ncollege campuses\u2014the students
        were really starting to talk about things that were going on in the\nworld
        and in America, and that had never been part of my exposure growing up. The
        Civil\nRights Movement took place\u2014I didn\u2019t even know what it was.
        Really in college that was my\nfirst exposure to racism, to sexism, to Eastern
        religion\u2014to all the things that were being talked\nabout at that time
        on campuses. I think that I was mystified and horrified and very overwhelmed\nby
        the times and all that information. I decided that I would drop out of school
        because I didn\u2019t\nreally know what I was doing there. This was much to
        my father\u2019s horror because he considered\neducation to be a huge privilege.
        Because it was given to me I don\u2019t think that I really\nappreciated it,
        and I felt like I was squandering my father\u2019s money and my time.\nI started
        to hitchhike to San Francisco from Boulder, and I stopped in Steamboat Springs
        and left\nfour years later. It was in Steamboat Springs\u2014a small ski town
        of about two thousand people at\nthe time. I got a job being a waitress and
        I got a job in a leather shop. I think the way I was living\na lot was pretty
        much a clich\u00e9 of the time. I learned how to have a garden and I started
        baking\nbread. I baked so much bread\u2014I have an obsessive personality\u2014that
        one day somebody brought\nme to a potter\u2019s house. He said, \u201cIf you
        like that, you\u2019ll like this,\u201d and he was right. This potter\nwas
        really old, probably fifty at the time\u2014to me, very old\u2014but it just
        so happened that he drank\nespresso and played cribbage. I\u2019m a big game
        player, so I would go to his place and I would play\ncribbage with him and
        I started throwing pots. I really liked it because it was very tactile. I
        had\nlearned how to cook and you will find that most potters are good cooks
        because they are very\nsimilar acts\u2014they get their hands dirty, they
        invent things, it\u2019s spontaneous.\nAW: What was the name of this potter?\nCMC:
        His name was Jerry Hollingsworth. I have no idea if he\u2019s still alive.
        I doubt it. He would\nbe ninety-five.\nAW: Is that when you first started
        working in ceramics?\nCMC: I started throwing pots and then I moved back to
        Minnesota unexpectedly because my\nfather died. I was twenty-three and I felt
        that I should be near my mother while my mother was\ngoing through this transition.
        I didn\u2019t really know what to do in Minneapolis because I had left\nand
        I had been living in the mountains and had been living pretty differently
        than I lived in\nMinnesota. I lived in places without electricity or plumbing
        and I didn\u2019t have a car and I didn\u2019t\nhave a phone and I really
        didn\u2019t want those things so this was like being in a foreign land\nbecause
        it had been what I grew up with but not what my comfort zone was at the time.\nI
        decided to go back to school because I had dropped out before I had completed
        college but I\nhad already fulfilled all my requirements so I took a pottery
        course and my teacher ended up\nbeing my husband. I had never been in an art
        class. One of your questions on the questionnaire\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n5\nwas, \u201cDid you grow
        up with art?\u201d I grew up with maps and shag carpet. So, no, we did not
        grow\nup with art or the conversation of art. If it would have come into the
        house my father would have\nmade fun out of it. However, my father I actually
        think that a lot of\u2014I think creativity is really\nnurtured. I think everybody
        has it, but people are either given permission by their environment or\nby
        themself in retaliation to their environment. My father, even though he was
        an engineer, he\nwas very conceptual. I remember studying algebra and I always
        wanted the answer, and he said,\n\u201cThe answer actually isn\u2019t important,
        it\u2019s the idea. If you understand the idea then you will\nalways know
        the answer; otherwise, answers change.\u201d It was a concept that I couldn\u2019t
        grasp at\nthe time but it was something that I learned from him. My mother
        just had a really interesting\nsensibility about things but she never took
        herself seriously. She didn\u2019t have a lot of self-esteem\nabout her creativity
        and I think that that\u2019s also something that\u2019s learned. My first
        husband\u2014who\nwas my teacher\u2014I worked with him in the beginning as
        an apprentice and I used to call myself a\nrookie and he used to say, \u201cIf
        you call yourself a rookie, a rookie is what you will always be.\nStart considering
        yourself a professional and you will become one.\u201d He was really\u2014even
        though\nI had gone through college and learned about sexism\u2014he was really
        the first professional that\ndemanded that I take myself seriously. So I did.\nAW:
        Where were you going to school?\nCMC: University of Colorado.\nAW: When you
        were taking this pottery class in Minnesota?\nCMC: University of Minnesota.
        I took classes from [Curt Hoard and] Warren [MacKenzie], and\nI had a polar
        opposite view of ceramics in Warren\u2019s classes when I did not have any
        self-confidence.\nWarren was an advocate for making Japanese pots and English
        pots and I would\nalways say, \u201cBut why would I make Japanese pots, Warren?
        I live in Minnesota. I\u2019ve lived in\nColorado. Why wouldn\u2019t I make
        something that is an expression of my experience?\u201d Warren is a\nstoryteller
        and Warren really fell in love with the story of Michael Cardew and Hamada
        and\nBernard Leach and so part of his legacy is to keep that story alive.
        I come more from\u2014not\nbecause I was trained that way\u2014it just synergistically
        made more sense to me to be\u2014it felt more\nhonest to talk about my own
        experiences even if they weren\u2019t very meaningful or deep. So that\u2019s\nwhat
        I chose to do. I could appreciate\u2014and I still can\u2014the beauty of
        a lot of that work but I\ndon\u2019t hold any work as the ultimate work. I
        like all different kinds of expression. I definitely like\nShoji Hamada\u2019s
        work better than Bernard Leach\u2019s.\nAW: Why is that?\nCMC: Bernard\u2019s
        is very, very tight and formal and, in my opinion, unapproachable.\nAW: Why

        the opposite of that. I like organic. I like approachable. I like\nunpredictable,
        asymmetrical.\nAW: What was it like being in class with Warren? Who were some
        of the other students? Who\nwere your colleagues at the time, fellow students?\nCMC:
        You know I don\u2019t have great recall. A lot of the potters I know now\u2014they
        were not my\ncontemporaries in school. Amy Sabrina was but she was younger
        but, as I said, she died. Gail\nKendall was a little older. She went on to
        teach. She\u2019s retired. Paul Dresang\u2014the drill I showed\nyou\u2014he
        was a grad student. Ron Gallas was a grad student. Bob Briscoe, I met later.
        I don\u2019t\nknow. Also, you know, I was a little older when I went back
        to school\u2014I was twenty-three\u2014I\nwas really interested in working
        because I had been out of school so I was no longer in school to\nkind of
        like hang out and meet kids.\nAW: And where were the art classes being held?\nCMC:

        And what year was this?\nCMC: This was in 1973, I think, \u201972-73.\nAW:
        Did you live on campus? Did you live off-campus?\nCMC: No, I lived on a farm,
        about forty-five minutes away from the university in Maple Grove.\nI lived
        in an old farmhouse. I had a goat shed for a studio. I would drive all of
        my green ware\npots into town in my car and fire them at the university.\nAW:
        Were there many students in a similar situation or were you in a unique situation
        there? Did\nmany students live on campus or live around the urban area or
        did they also live out beyond the\nmetro area?\nCMC: I don\u2019t think that
        many students did that, no. I lived with a glassblower and his wife. A\nglassblower
        that was a grad student and his wife, who were also really into being in the
        country.\nAW: Was there a strong sense of community among the students who
        were involved in the arts\non campus?\nCMC: I think that as I grew into becoming
        a potter\u2014because in those days, it really wasn\u2019t a\nvocation unless
        you were a teacher or a production potter. I really didn\u2019t like teaching
        and I\nreally also wasn\u2019t a production potter. In those days you did
        art fairs. Kind of what Bob [Briscoe]\ndoes, Bob does a little teaching and
        a little art fairs. I did stuff like that. The sense of community\nwas hugely
        strong and hugely unique in that you were almost like relatives that liked
        each other.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n7\nYou
        didn\u2019t have secrets. I remember when I first started getting to know
        the \u201cart community\u201d\u2014\nsculptors, painters, people in other
        mediums\u2014people were really guarded about how they did\nwhat they did.
        Potters were not like that. It\u2019s like, if you liked this cup, \u201cShow
        me how you made\nthe handle. What\u2019s your glaze?\u201d No one ever said,
        \u201cI won\u2019t tell you that, that\u2019s my secret thing.\u201d\nI\u2019m
        sure there were people like that, but that would have been very uncommon.
        I don\u2019t think it\nwas specific to this area but it was really kind of
        a, you know, help your neighbor, if your barn\nburns down you all go back
        and rebuild it. People just helped each other a lot. In that way it was\na
        very friendly community.\nI have a son now who is thirty years old and he
        went to the Chicago Art Institute for school\u2014\nwhich is where Warren
        MacKenzie went\u2014and he graduated about eight or nine years ago and it\nwas
        really interesting because we went around the country looking at schools with
        Wiley. Wiley\nhad been in art for a long time. He started when he was very
        young. When we went to look at art\ndepartments, at this point, people no
        longer married materials. Even RISD, which started out\nRhode Island School
        of Art and Design. When we went to look at it with Wiley, you had to\ndeclare,
        Are you a photographer? Are you a sculptor? Are you a weaver? Bang, you know,
        six\nweeks in. Two years later, only seven or eight years ago, and definitely
        an indication of the\nschool that Wiley went to, you didn\u2019t marry a material.
        You might be in clay, then you might be\nin fiber, and then you might be doing
        something with graphics. Actually, my son Wiley over the\nyears has encouraged
        me to exploit that idea. I\u2019ve gone to the New York Studio School twelve\nyears
        ago and started doing figurative drawing. I make things out of shells. I make
        things out of\nstone. I\u2019m probably the only potter on the Tour that works
        in a lot of different materials.\nHowever, when I work in clay, that\u2019s
        all I work in. Sometimes I bring my drawings to clay. But,\nI think my son
        is actually really the cause of a lot of that.\n00:22:00\nAW: Does he have
        a focused art form he does now or does he also work in lots of materials?\nCMC:
        He started in photography. He worked in lots of materials. He lived in Berlin
        for six years.\nNow he\u2019s working as a creative in a small advertising
        firm in Minnesota. He adores it and he\u2019s\nreally good at it.\nAW: To
        get back to your family history\u2014you were taking a class with Fuller?\nCMC:
        No, no, no. Fuller is not my first husband. My first husband was a man named
        Curt Hoard\nand he was a professor at the university, along with Warren. Curt
        and I got married in 1977 and\nwe were married for fourteen years. Then I
        was working with Fuller on a project, and then\nanother project, and then
        seven years later we got married.\nAW: And when about was that?\nCMC: Fuller
        and I got married in 1991.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n8\nAW:
        I thought I saw 1991 on the bowl by Amy [Sabrina]. [Bowl made by Amy Sabrina
        for\nConnee and Fuller].\nCMC: Correct.\nAW: I wondered if that was a special
        date for you both. How did you come to meet Fuller?\nCMC: Fuller\u2019s mother
        was an art collector. She was a philanthropist in the community. She was\non
        the Board of the Walker Art Center. She came to one of my shows. Fuller went
        to art school.\nHe went to Bennington. When he came home on one of his vacations,
        she wanted him to meet\nother artists. She brought him over and that\u2019s
        how I met him.\nAW: Do you have another son?\nCMC: I have another son named
        Westin and those sons are both Curt Hoard\u2019s biological\nchildren. We\u2019ve
        all raised them. Curt remains to be our friend. He actually works in my studio.\nWe
        have one of those crazy families that everybody was married to someone else.
        But, we get\nalong.\nAW: Curt is still in the area?\nCMC: Curt is in the area.
        He works out here and then he lives in Arizona part of the year and\nlives
        in Minnesota part of the year.\nAW: Did you guys work together to do art shows,
        craft shows and things like that?\n00:24:48\nCMC: Curt and I? A little bit,
        yeah, we did. If our marriage could only have existed in a studio\nwe would
        have never been divorced because we got along really well in a studio. My
        non-artist\nfriends sometimes look at me and they will say, \u201cIt must
        take so much self-discipline to do what\nyou do.\u201d And I go, \u201cIt
        does, but the self-discipline comes in leaving the studio, not in staying
        in\nthe studio.\u201d It\u2019s really easy once you become an artist to work
        because it\u2019s sort of a conversation\nwhere you\u2019re never wrong. If
        you make a mistake you get to work through the mistake\u2014it\u2019s a\nchallenge,
        it\u2019s very satisfying once you figure it out. You can talk to other people.
        \u201cWhy is this\nblowing up? Why is this running?\u201d But we all have
        internal conversations\u2014emotionally,\npsychologically, philosophically\u2014that
        is always being processed in work. So, if you are terribly\nsad, if you are
        overjoyed\u2014your studio is your best friend because it\u2019s your outlet;
        it\u2019s your\nconversation piece; it\u2019s your conduit, your work is.
        Leaving that place\u2014you have to be very\nintentional about leaving it.
        It tends to attract\u2014most artists, I would venture to guess\u2014are\nobsessive
        compulsive types of people. They like to just work really hard and go do something\nforever
        and barely come up for air. I can\u2019t think of one person that\u2019s really
        an artist that I would\ncall a serious artist that isn\u2019t like that.\nA

        Would you kind of say, at the same time, there needs to be a sense of balance?\nCMC:
        Depending on how balanced you want to be. There are a lot of fabulous artists
        that don\u2019t\nstrive to be balanced and they probably are the best artists.
        If you study Jackson Pollock, or Pete\nVoulkos. I mean, Pete Voulkos was an
        addict. He was an alcoholic. He had some very nasty\nhabits. Loved people,
        completely good-hearted and worked all the time. Would you want to be\nmarried
        to the guy? No. Was he one of the best artists ever? Yes. You have to make
        that decision\nonce you become an artist. How crazy do I want to be? How obsessed
        do I want to get? It\u2019s a\nconscious decision.\nAW: Did you have a point
        in your life when you came to that decision?\nCMC: Yeah, definitely.\nAW:
        When was that? How did that come about?\nCMC: I don\u2019t remember exactly.
        I think that when I was exploring ideas of my subconscious\nthere was some
        point where I was like, how crazy do I want to go? Then I kind of very\nconsciously
        went, not over the edge of where I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,
        which is less\nbrave, probably. I also had a very conscious decision, probably
        about ten years ago, so probably\naround the age of fifty-five, where I was
        in my studio. My studio is out in the yard. It was eleven\no\u2019clock in
        the night and I used to not really work less than twelve hours a day. I would
        say\ntwelve hours a day would be an average workday. I remember looking at
        the light and thinking,\nI\u2019m really tired. I really don\u2019t want to
        be doing this. I have a husband in the house that would\nmuch rather have
        me be in there with him. He would bring dinner out for me and I would\nbasically
        say, \u201cThank you very much, go away,\u201d so I could get my work done.
        And I thought,\nwhy am I doing this? I have done this for thirty years. Do
        I need to just do this to prove to myself\nthat I can do it? What\u2019s that
        about? So, I went in the house and I was like, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just\nnot
        going to work at night anymore, because I don\u2019t want to.\u201d But, it
        took me thirty years to give\nmyself permission to not do that. I think that
        there was something about having to work those\nreally long crazy hours to
        really take myself\u2014to know that I was serious myself. I think that my\nwork
        has always had a lot of ideas that have continued to develop, so I\u2019ve
        never been self-conscious\nabout my work not having enough meat to it. I think
        that I had Peter Voulkos in my\nstudio a couple of times. I think I was very
        self-conscious the first time he ever picked up one of\nmy pots and started
        to scrutinize it. I was really nervous that it was too pretty. Usually, I\u2019m
        not\nso self-conscious about my work.\n00:30:45\nAW: This is a good transition.
        Can you tell us a little bit about your work? What did you start out\ndoing?\nCMC:
        I\u2019ve always made impregnated shapes. I\u2019ve always liked very full
        shapes, which is why I\nended up going to a figurative drawing school because
        I wanted, actually, really voluptuous\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC.
        Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n10\nwomen\u2014to draw them. I\u2019ve just been
        attracted to those very kind of bulging, curving shapes.\nI\u2019ve always,
        somehow, distorted the shape because I want to invite in touch. When something
        is\nperfect people tend to look at it and not to want to get involved in it,
        or appearing to be perfect. If\nyou throw something tight and round, there
        is really no reason to go after it. If it has a dent, if it\nhas finger marks,
        to me, it becomes more human. My work is organic. My work, I would\ndescribe,
        as having very sensual shapes, and is very gestural. It\u2019s functional.
        I have not made\nmany things that are just sculptural. Six years ago I did
        break my back in an accident and I\ncouldn\u2019t work for a year. I couldn\u2019t
        not stop working so I actually\u2014Fuller rigged up a thing so I\ncould work
        standing up. It\u2019s the only year in my forty-two years that I\u2019ve
        hand-built. But I did\nthat. I started out with stoneware because that\u2019s
        what everybody threw and then once I saw\nporcelain, porcelain reminded me
        of cream cheese, I don\u2019t know. I liked what colors did on\nporcelain,
        so I went to porcelain and never looked back. That was thirty-five years ago.
        Porcelain\nis temperamental. It\u2019s a little bit of a prima donna. Once
        you learn\u2014clay has a conversation of\nits own. Any potter learns that
        pretty early on that you have to be very intentional about what\nyou want
        and then at some point the clay has a voice and you have to be astute enough
        to listen\nto that. Usually, a really good piece captures the energy of the
        clay and your intention.\nAW: When you were first starting in the seventies,
        in the U of M classes, how would you\ndescribe your work then?\nCMC: Same.\nAW:
        Was that common at that time or was that a new approach to pottery? Or did
        that come\nthrough Warren\u2019s teaching of function--?\nCMC: No, it didn\u2019t
        come through any of their teaching at the time. Warren made brown pots, I\ndidn\u2019t
        like brown pots. Curt made low-fired political pots. I didn\u2019t like those
        either. So, I don\u2019t\nknow, no. I liked food. My first plate was an homage
        to cheesecake because I thought\ncheesecake was almost religious it was so
        divine and I thought no plate ever did justice to\ncheesecake, so I made a
        plate with a Japanese glaze called tenmoku which is a brown-black that\nWarren
        uses and the white of the cheesecake just popped off of that rich chocolaty
        surface. I\u2019ve\nalways found food to be very sensual and so kind of playing
        the juxtaposition of color and form\nagainst the food was really interesting
        to me. Then as I got more developed I did it with flowers.\nI love flowers
        and so lots of times the pots are really interesting when they\u2019re used
        with\nsomething.\n00:35:15\nAW: When did you start showing your work?\nCMC:
        I think I started showing my work in art fairs, probably three or four years
        after I started\nmaking work. I did a couple art fairs and then like, you
        know, high schools or whatever would\nhave shows and I would have shows like
        that.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n11\nAW:
        Mostly around the Twin Cities or in other--?\nCMC: Yeah, and there were other
        places too. I don\u2019t remember.\nAW: Were you also working at the time?\nCMC:
        I taught ceramics. When I first came here I think I waitressed and then after
        that I knew\nhow to throw pots well enough that I taught. But I never liked
        teaching. I did have one\nexperience teaching that I loved. Minnesota used
        to have a thing called Percent for Art Program\nwhere one percent of any budget
        of a Minnesota state building went for art. These Percent for\nArt projects
        were national. Fuller and I did about three of them. One of them that we did
        was at a\nwomen\u2019s maximum security prison in Shakopee. This project was
        probably twelve years ago.\nYou went in and they wanted something that some
        of the prisoners would work on. We were\nelected to go in and we proposed
        that we would build these very sculptural benches\u2014and I\u2019ll\nshow
        you one outside\u2014that they\u2019re kind of very Gaudi-esque, covered with
        tile. We would have\nthe women do images on the tile and then we would then
        cover these benches\u2014skin them\nessentially\u2014in their artwork.\nWhen
        we went into this prison the women made forty cents an hour and they paid
        them two\ndollars to come and hear us talk. I remember thinking, That\u2019s
        humbling, because usually by that\ntime, if we would go and give a lecture
        we would be paid a stipend of five hundred dollars or\nsomething like that\u2014Come
        speak at our school. They\u2019re being paid five hours worth of work to\ncome
        and hear us talk and by the way, that was only two bucks. So, I was like,
        Okay. We went in\nand there were like twenty women in the room and I walked
        up to the front and this huge black\nwoman sat down next to me and she said,
        \u201cHoney, there ain\u2019t nothing you got to say that I want\nto hear.\u201d
        So they were just there to clock their time. We started talking about the
        creative\nprocess, and they were looking really bored. And then we started
        showing them slides of our\nwork and then they were more interested because
        they could tell that we didn\u2019t make little peanut\ndolls. Then one of
        them said, \u201cWhy would I want to make anything beautiful for this place?
        I\nhate this place.\u201d And I said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s not about the
        object, it\u2019s about the process. I don\u2019t\nmake things for the object.
        I make things for the process of creating something. Once I have\nfinished
        it, I\u2019m finished. It\u2019s done.\u201d\nPeople always ask me, \u201cHow
        can you sell that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s easy. It\u2019s done.
        It\u2019s a\nconversation that I\u2019ve already had.\u201d Then they asked
        us if we would edit their work and we said,\n\u201cYes,\u201d but if anything
        looked like they made it to please someone else, I would destroy. I said,\n\u201cIt
        has to come from you because only you have your own set of experiences and
        if it has that\nintegrity and that honesty, it is going to be really interesting.
        We were there for six months. The\nprison staff thought that we would maybe
        have two or three people working with us, and we cut\nthe class off at forty-five.
        We worked there for six months, and we had amazing experiences and\nthey made
        amazing things. We had critiques. In the last critique, everybody was talking
        about\ntheir experiences in the class\u2014now, understand that these are
        women that half of them have\nmurdered somebody. They were drug dealers. They
        were prostitutes. They were child abusers.\nThey were hardcore criminals.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n12\nThe
        reason why I loved it as a teacher is because lots of times if you go in and
        teach a class, you\nknow, you\u2019re there to make a casserole for your mother
        for Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s really boring for\nme as a teacher and I
        am not generous of heart enough to get excited about your mother\u2019s\ncasserole.
        I just really don\u2019t give a shit. These women\u2014no one had ever said
        to them, \u201cWho are\nyou? Why do you think the way you think? Show me.\u201d
        That is something that is a luxury and for\nthat conversation to even be respected.
        Before I walked into that prison I never realized that there\nwere people
        like that and then what happens if, when you\u2019re two, you\u2019re forced
        to drink alcohol\nto go to sleep, or you\u2019re sexually abused, or you\u2019re
        beaten. What does that tell you? So they had\na lot to express in their work
        if you can well imagine. In our final critique I just said, \u201cHere\u2019s\nwhat
        I learned, that sitting at this table with you forty women, you are no different
        than any of\nmy girlfriends with the exception of one thing. You were told
        you were a piece of shit when you\nwere two, and I was told I could be anything
        I want to be. That\u2019s the difference and that\u2019s the\nonly difference.
        You can go forward from this point on, giving yourself value, giving your\nexperiences
        some credibility because of the knowledge that you have, because of the path
        that\nyou have, and maybe you can\u2019t go outside and ride a bike but there
        are a lot of women who live\nin two million dollar houses in Edina that are
        in prison, but they\u2019re not aware of the prison that\nthey\u2019re in
        or, maybe, they\u2019re aware of it, but it doesn\u2019t have bars and it\u2019s
        not so easy. You can be\nin prison, but you can be free.\u201d\nThat teaching
        experience\u2014it\u2019s a really roundabout way\u2014they were hungry, they
        were honest,\nthey had a ton of integrity, and it was a huge turn-on to me.
        Teachers are giving, giving, giving\nand I get drained. I need an exchange.\n00:43:40\nAW:
        Is that the only One Percent project you did? You said you did a couple others?\nCMC:
        Yes, we did one for City Hall in [Vadnais Heights, and a big project in Anoka
        metro\ntreatment center.]\nAW: Actually, before you get to that and following
        up on this story\u2014are there any pieces that\nstick in your mind about
        working with the female prisoners\u2014any pieces that still stick in your\nmind
        today, because of the story or the piece itself?\nCMC: Any pieces\u2014you
        mean objects?\nAW: Yes, pieces\u2014were they creating their own individual
        pieces?\nCMC: Well, they were carving in wood and making blocks to print.
        Were there any objects? No,\nthe experience has stuck with me, hugely. It
        was one of the most magnificent privileges that I\never had was being in a
        situation where we could all grow so much. Also, the unifying factor in\nthat
        prison that we experienced was being creative because the lesbians hated the
        straights, the\nwhites hated the blacks, everybody hated the Indians, the
        prostitutes hated the drug dealers, the\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC.
        Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n13\nmurderers hated everybody else. They all had
        issues. When they walked into the art room, it all\nstayed outside. The first
        day the Indian woman said to me, \u201cWhy are you playing their music?\u201d
        I\nwas playing Aretha Franklin. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s great music.\u201d
        It was their music. Two months later that\nIndian woman was teaching a black
        woman to carve. It broke down these stereotypes of, Well, I\ndon\u2019t like
        you, you have thick hair, I have thin hair, I want your hair, I don\u2019t
        like you\u2014whatever\nreasons people come up with to shut people out. It
        was a very inclusive experience. It was\nwonderful.\nAW: You said that you
        started out with about forty-five students or so\u2014so they kept coming\nback,
        the same students each time?\nCMC: Yeah, but they kept bringing people and
        finally we had to stop it because it just got too\nbig for us to manage. The
        prison guards hated us and they could not wait for our project to be\nfinished.\nAW:
        Why was that?\nCMC: Because we were promoting creativity instead of shame
        and retribution and, \u201cConfess\nyour sins and maybe some day you will
        be redeemed.\u201d We didn\u2019t do that.\nAW: What did women say when you
        were telling them, \u201cThere is no difference here?\u201d\nCMC: You know,
        we\u2019re walking into people\u2019s lives who have had a pattern of twenty,
        thirty,\nforty years and we\u2019re there for six months. All we can do is
        plant a seed. I think we made a big\ndifference. What were their reactions?
        One of the times that we went out there\u2014you know, it\nwas two hours of
        a drive for us to go there, so it was four hours for us to go work there.
        We left\nat six-thirty in the morning to get there and you have to volunteer
        on a sheet that you\u2019re going to\ncome and they were going to come work
        with us. We got out there; no one was there. You can\u2019t\ncall them. On
        the phone you send, I forgot what it was called, a kite? Anyway, about an
        hour\nlater these four women come dragging in. These women all have killed
        people. Some of them\noutweighed me four times. I was just like them when
        I was like with anybody else. I was like,\n\u201cWhere the fuck have you been?
        I have been waiting here for two hours.\u201d I was pissed off, which\nis
        why I\u2019m not a good teacher. It\u2019s like, you ask me to be involved,
        I\u2019m there. But if you\u2019re not,\ndon\u2019t waste my time. So, I was
        there, they were like, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d \u201cYou
        didn\u2019t feel\nlike it? Well, maybe I didn\u2019t feel like getting up
        at six-thirty in the morning.\u201d But what I learned,\nagain, was that was
        my training. You are your word. They didn\u2019t have that training. That
        wasn\u2019t\npart of their upbringing. You either showed up because you were
        going to get punished if you\ndidn\u2019t, or you were going to get rewarded.
        That\u2019s why you showed up. Not because I said, \u201cI\u2019ll\nbe there.\u201d
        That\u2019s my middle-class white upbringing: be your word. So all those kinds
        of lessons\nwere really in my face.\nWhen you\u2019re an artist you learn
        humility in a lot of ways. When I was actually in the New York\nStudio School,
        I went to the school, and after I went to the school I worked with one of
        the\nexpressionists that was one of my teachers. I just worked with her. I
        went to New York to work\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n14\nwith
        her. I went to one of her night classes one time. There was this ninety year-old
        woman in\nthe night class and the class was like fifteen students big. The
        teacher\u2019s name was Ofra and\nOfra\u2014she was from Israel\u2014and she
        said, \u201cConnee, come over here, I want you to look at\nIngrid\u2019s work.\u201d
        I walked to the other side of the room. It was na\u00efve painting and it
        was really\ngreat. And I said, \u201cThis is great.\u201d This woman, she
        said, \u201cYou have such beautiful hair.\u201d And\nI\u2019m like, \u201cThank
        you.\u201d And I hear one of the students go, \u201cShh! Shh!\u201d and they\u2019re
        drawing a\nmodel. And I said, \u201cThis is really great and this painting,
        what is this about?\u201d And she goes,\n\u201cYour skin is so soft, my dear.\u201d
        And then again the, \u201cShh! Shh!\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I better
        go to\nthe other side of the room. Thank you for letting me see your work.\u201d
        And so I go back to where\nI\u2019m painting. At the end of the night I go
        have a coffee with Ofra. She said, \u201cWhat did you think\nof my class?\u201d
        I said, \u201cI think your students are assholes.\u201d I said, \u201cI think
        if they want to be artists,\nthey first have to learn how to be human beings.\u201d
        So, she goes and tells them the next day, \u201cMy\nfriend says if you want
        to be an artist,\u201d\u2014because that was the part of being in art school
        that I\nreally hated\u2014being old. It\u2019s like, I forget what it\u2019s
        like to be twenty and you want to be an artist\nand you have to wear certain
        clothes, and you have to wear your hair a certain way, and you have\nto have
        piercings and tattoos\u2014there\u2019s like, this image. You don\u2019t care
        about these images if you\nhave been doing something for a long time. You\u2019re
        not self-conscious in that way. To me, the\nfact this old woman was in this
        painting class, spewing her guts out in painting, and then this\nyoung woman
        was so intolerant of the fact that she was deaf and talked really loudly\u2014I
        had no\ntime for that. If I would have been the teacher I would have told
        her to leave the room. That\u2019s\nhow intolerant I am. But, you know, humility?
        Yes. Tolerance? I don\u2019t know. [Laughs]\n00:52:00\nAW: I think you make
        a really important point here. You\u2019ve been in so many different classroom\nsituations,
        or educational institutions, to see over time how students respond in the
        moment of\nlearning and practicing art and then coming to this situation where
        this woman was trying to\nmake a connection with you and taking the time to
        allow that to happen--\nCMC: --But that will happen in any school. That will
        happen in a university. I\u2019ve taught in a\nuniversity classroom where
        there is some Russian woman who is elderly and taking a night class\nand will
        work for two months on a project and then a football player turns in a project
        that he\u2019s\nbeen working on for two months. He made his in ten minutes.
        She made hers in two months. But\nhe happens to be really good looking and
        a football star, and in the critique, he will start to give\nthis spiel about
        all of the heavy meaning of this thing. And I will go, \u201cReally? Does
        that work for\nyou? Where does that work for you\u2014in the backseat of a
        car or on the football field? It doesn\u2019t\nwork in an art class. And you
        are insulting me and everybody else by trying to pretend that is\nanything
        other than a total turd sitting on the table.\u201d I don\u2019t know that
        I could be a teacher\nbecause I would probably get into a lot of trouble because
        I\u2019d be like the temp at the time,\n\u201cWhoa, don\u2019t bring her back
        really soon.\u201d Bob Briscoe loves me because I am very candid. I\u2019m\nnot
        mean spirited, I just don\u2019t hang out in places I don\u2019t want to be,
        even if it\u2019s a conversation.\nAW: It seems from this conversation that
        art is more than, like you said, it\u2019s not about the final\nproduct, it\u2019s
        about the process\u2014it\u2019s about connecting with other people--\nA Measure

        if you were to ask me about being an artist I would tell you\u2014you are
        asking me\nabout being an artist? I am telling you that if you walk into the

        I will look at you and go, It\u2019s not about the teapot. Why has this\nperson
        come into my life? The teapot is merely the conduit, it\u2019s merely the
        vessel. It\u2019s my\nconduit of a conversation that somebody is going to
        all of a sudden respond to or not. I have a\nbetter chance of them responding
        to it if I can get them to touch the work. So, then, the fact that\nonly one
        of ten thousand people walk into my studio? That\u2019s fine with me. I don\u2019t
        need\neverybody to walk into my studio and go, \u201cLove this.\u201d Don\u2019t

        You were telling us about when Peter Voulkos came into your studio. Can you
        tell us more\nabout him? When we first arrived you showed us one of his artworks.
        How did you come to\nknow about him and his work? What has he meant in your
        art?\nCMC: I think that he is probably, to me, one of the most important contemporary
        ceramists\nbecause I think he really revolutionized the material and the context
        of what it\u2019s always been\nheld in. He brought it out of being functional
        where it doesn\u2019t need to be functional. He brought\nthe conversation
        into the fact that you can talk about the idea of a vessel. It doesn\u2019t
        have to hold\ncoffee or flowers to be valid. But it can be valid if it holds
        coffee or flowers. So, even though I\ndon\u2019t make brown pots like Mack
        [Warren MacKenzie] does, I also don\u2019t make pots like Pete\ndoes. I don\u2019t
        make plates that you put on the wall. My plates\u2014you can serve food from.
        I like\nthe functionality and I love the marriage of food and pots of flowers.
        I love ritual. I love creating\na setting. I think that you can do all of
        that with the pottery. How did I feel about Pete? He was\nsort of a bigger
        than life teacher. He would come in to do workshops. He was fueled by students.\nHe
        loved teaching and he is such a rough and ready teacher. He\u2019d be drinking
        Jack Daniels and\nsitting down at a wheel, throwing pots. This is not my style.
        I don\u2019t know that I was in awe of his\npersonal choices, but I was in
        awe of the work that he created and the energy he brought to the\nwork. The
        honesty of the work. The integrity of the work. The way he pushed clay around.\nAmazing.\nAW:

        He lived in Berkeley and he taught at\u2014where did he teach? I don\u2019t
        know. You could look\nit up.\nAW: And how did you come in contact with him?\nCMC:
        In the world of clay there are these big conferences. We used to have a conference
        called\nSuper Mud. There is something called NCECA\u2014National Council on

        Why was he out here?\nCMC: He came here\u2014the Art Institute had him do
        something. Because Curt was a professor,\nlots of times if there was a visiting
        artist, they would end up at our house. I don\u2019t know, you just,\nit\u2019s
        a small world. You know those people. Good friends of mine, Bob Brady and
        Sandy Simon,\nlive in Berkeley. They\u2019re both ceramists. They have a gallery.
        I would go to Berkeley to visit\nthem and then we would go to Pete\u2019s
        studio and see him.\nAW: When you were recalling that moment when he first
        came in and he was holding one of\nyour pots\u2014did you guys strike up a
        conversation?\nCMC: Oh, I wanted to die. It would be like Gandhi looking at
        your philanthropic project. It was\njust like, are you kidding me? He was
        like, \u201cOh, tell me about this.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s\nnothing
        much to say!\u201d I was just ridiculous. I wanted him to leave. [Laughs].\n01:00:10\nAW:
        That\u2019s a lot of pressure.\nCMC: Yeah, I just wanted him out of there.
        I think I was just way too self-conscious.\nAW: But it sounds like you continued
        to go and visit him in his studio and--\nCMC: Yeah, it wasn\u2019t that often.
        I probably was at his studio maybe three or four times and he\nwas at our
        place a couple of times and then just in different public things a few times.
        Probably\nfifteen times, you know, would run into him. He was more a hero
        than a contemporary.\nDefinitely wasn\u2019t a contemporary.\nAW: Who were
        some other inspiring artists?\nCMC: The first one that pops into my mind is
        Philip Glass, who is a musician.\nAW: Why is he inspiring to you?\nCMC: I
        don\u2019t know. He just takes me away to another world that I\u2019m comfortable
        in and\nchallenges me. I love Picasso\u2019s paintings. I love Dubuffet--sculpture.
        I like Diana Arbus\u2019\nphotographs.\nAW: Did you happen to see the exhibit
        of her work\u2014was that a couple of years ago\u2014at the\nWalker?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n17\nCMC: Uh-huh,
        yeah.\nAW: What is it about her photography that is interesting to you?\nCMC:
        She catches contradiction. I love juxtaposition. I like putting something
        precious with\nsomething completely banal. She taught me a different way of
        looking at people. You know, you\nlook at a face in any of her photographs
        and if you cover up half the face you see one thing and if\nyou cover up the
        other half you see something totally different. You see that when you paint\nfaces.\nAW:
        When we first came in you were showing us some of the works of Peter\u2019s
        students over the\nyears. Can you tell us more about those pieces and artists?\nCMC:
        Jun Kaneko. He lives in Lincoln, Nebraska. To me, Jun is about pattern and
        making\npattern a painting, and because it\u2019s in glaze it\u2019s more
        volatile than oil or anything else. Also, the\nscale that he works at\u2014although
        not everything that Jun makes, I love\u2014but that\u2019s true of most\nartists.
        His work is very different than Pete\u2019s, but again, I really respect things
        when they have a\nlot of integrity and they are more of a conversation about
        what that artist is thinking about or\ndiscovering than about knowing where
        their influences come from. You know, if you look at a\npainting and go, Well,
        that person loved Francis Bacon. If you immediately jump to a famous\nartist
        when you look at work, I think it\u2019s less interesting. There\u2019s an
        old saying that \u201cAmateurs\nborrow and professionals steal.\u201d Nothing
        is original but people will have an idea enough where\nit\u2019s not reminding
        you of something else. Akiyo, again, he\u2019s very painterly. He\u2019s into
        eroticism\nbut not in a way that\u2019s so in your face. It\u2019s sort of
        playful and I am just attracted to it.\n01:05:15\nAW: Have you met Jun and
        Akiyo?\nCMC: Hmm-mm.\nAW: What was it like meeting them?\nCMC: Pete was my
        favorite. I mean Jun and Akiyo are both Japanese so they\u2019re much more\nreserved.
        Pete was just out there and he was great.\nAnother man that I think was very
        influential for me was a guy named Jim Melchert, and I\u2019ll\nshow you his
        work. Jim Melchert\u2014even though, again, he\u2019s in his eighties and
        he\u2019s a Berkeley\nartist\u2014he\u2019s so conceptual, and he\u2019s so
        intrigued with the idea\u2014for many years he made\nsituations rather than
        objects. He came into the University of Minnesota forty years ago and did
        a\nworkshop with all the art students and brought everybody out of their comfort
        zone. \u201cYou know\nAndy because she is a History major. Where are your
        grandparents from?\u201d All of a sudden I\u2019m\nlooking at you as Irish
        or whatever you are. Jim Melchert said to everybody, \u201cEverybody in this\nroom
        does something really well other than their art. As a matter of fact you do
        it so well you\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n18\nprobably
        don\u2019t even know what it is, but I want you to come back in three days
        and show\neveryone what it is.\u201d Thirty-five years later anybody that
        was in that room can tell you what\neverybody did. Or he would have us--\nAW:
        --What did you do?\nCMC: What did I do? I can do tricks with my spit. I can
        blow bubbles with spit and also if I eat\nsomething sour I can gleek\u2014I
        can open my mouth and fountains of spit come out like this. So I\ncame in
        sunglasses and I blew bubbles and then I bit into a lemon and then I gleeked.
        That was\nwhat I did.\nOne of the kids in there was a thief who was a student.
        He stole things from all these different\npeople that were in the workshop
        and then brought them into the workshop. You know, the\nsculpture teacher\u2019s
        screen door, the distributor cap, the mailbox, he just went around and then\nbrought
        them all in. The sculpture teacher who always yelled at everyone had studied
        Native\nAmerican dance his whole life and put on this big feather thing and
        did all this dance. My\nfavorite was a woman who was much older than the rest
        of us\u2014she was probably forty\u2014and she\nlooked like she would sell
        Tupperware\u2014all of her clothes matched\u2014and she said, \u201cWhat I
        do\nwell is I cope. And while I cope, I peel grapefruit.\u201d And she brought
        in this bowl of grapefruit\nand she took a knife and she went, \u201cchk,
        chk, chk, chk, chk, chk,\u201d and she peeled this entire\ngrapefruit in one
        piece and then went, \u201cpoh, poh, poh, poh,\u201d and all the membranes
        came out.\nAnd she goes, \u201cOkay, tell me your problems.\u201d You felt
        like you were at her kitchen table.\nSomeone went, \u201cWell, my seventeen
        year old wants her boyfriend to sleep over. What do I do?\u201d\nShe goes,
        \u201cWell,\u201d and she picks up a grapefruit. It was like, wow. It was
        so much fun but it\u2019s like\nwhen you\u2019re in art, these little snippets
        are so interesting. That woman was like a living\nperformance piece. That
        was so creative what she was doing. But our society might say, \u201cWell,\nyou
        have to be this important painting to be creative.\u201d No, actually, not
        true. It\u2019s just wedding\nthat that can kind of set off all these different
        things. Jim Melchert, oh, he did it in spades. He\nwould say, \u201cGo away
        with your little group and create a pantomime that\u2019s a lie and a truth.
        Come\nback in an hour and show it to the group.\u201d \u201cGo away and create
        a kinetic sculpture with your\nshadow.\u201d You know, so you\u2019re always
        looking at your body, you\u2019re not looking at what your\nbody does out
        here other than when you\u2019re walking down the street you might go, Look
        at how\nlong my shadow is, but you\u2019re never thinking about how your shadows
        might build and move\nthings with each other. He just got you aware of your
        expectations. Even being aware of your\nexpectations can feed into the world
        of creativity, in a way. What\u2019s fabulous about being an\nartist, being
        a potter, is we\u2019re always changing. We change everyday. Our career\u2014it\u2019s
        a venue\nfor that. It doesn\u2019t fight against that. It\u2019s very exciting
        to be in life, and when you are in a\ncreative expression\u2014it doesn\u2019t
        matter what it is, you can be a writer\u2014you can always feed it.\nYou always
        have a venue for it, and that\u2019s really a luxury, a huge luxury.\n[AUDIO
        NOTE: Rain begins. Not too loud but sounds like static.]\n01:11:02\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n19\nAW: When did
        you decide that you wanted to make this a career? Or did you ever decide that
        or\ndid it just kind of evolve?\nCMC: I think it evolved. I don\u2019t think
        that I decided I wanted to make it a career. When I was in\nhigh school you
        took a test and my test said I should be a forest ranger. I think that just
        living in\nthe mountains and being exposed to a potter and it was very tactile
        and then going to classes,\ngoing to an art fair\u2014it just sort of evolved.
        Oh, you can actually make money doing this, you\nreally can\u2019t make enough
        money doing this, you have to teach. All of that. Young potters come\nup to
        me and say, \u201cHow do you make this a career?\u201d I think it\u2019s something
        that you feed from\nthe inside out rather than the outside in. You let things
        evolve, you notice that they\u2019re evolving,\nand then you push it, rather
        than, I want to be a fireman, I\u2019ll go train. But then when you start
        to\ndefine what you do you do have to push it, you have to work on it. Oh,
        I\u2019m going to do this\u2014\nthen you have to do it.\nAW: How did you
        start doing it in those early years?\nCMC: I don\u2019t know. I just started
        working more and more. I liked teaching less and less. I taught\nfor five
        or six years. I didn\u2019t really like doing that. And then--\nAW: --Mostly
        at the U [University of Minnesota]?\nCMC: No, I taught at a community center.
        The only reason why I taught at the U is because I\nwould substitute teach.
        Or, I would teach workshops, but I didn\u2019t really like that. I think that\nafter
        awhile you start getting a group of people that start liking your work. I
        started self-producing\nshows. I used to be in a lot of shows and then I stopped
        doing that. I used to be in a lot\nof galleries. I stopped doing that.\nAW:
        What was your family\u2019s response once you started producing a lot, doing
        shows, what was\nyour mother\u2019s response?\nCMC: My father had died. My
        father died when I was very young before I did any of this. My\nmother was
        basically very disapproving. My mother thought I was giving a huge disservice
        to\nmy husband for having a job and also to my children. Whenever I would
        have shows and my\nmother would come she would say, \u201cWell, of course
        I\u2019m so proud of my daughter.\u201d Really it was\nout of my mother\u2019s
        comfort zone and also I don\u2019t think that my mother ever really could
        invest\nin me in a way other than how she thought I might be, which was not
        the way I was. So no, I\ndidn\u2019t have my mother\u2019s approval.\nAW:
        What about your siblings?\nCMC: No, not really. I shouldn\u2019t say that.
        My brother, yes, but I could do anything and my\nbrother would think it was
        cool. My sister and I were always just opposites and still are. She\u2019s\nvery
        good hearted, but my sister loves raw steak and male strippers. I\u2019m a
        vegetarian and like\npottery. Just really different people.\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n20\n01:15:15\nAW:
        Do they live here in Minnesota?\nCMC: My sister lives in L.A. and my brother
        lives in Dallas, Texas.\nAW: Over time did your mother change her views?\nCMC:
        No, she even felt stronger that it was selfish.\nAW: What did that mean for
        you as you were working?\nCMC: Nothing, no. I stopped trying to seek my mother\u2019s
        approval quite early on.\nAW: When you were raising your kids\u2014how did
        you teach them about art? What were the\nfamily conversations around art and
        what it means?\nCMC: My children have always grown up with art. My children
        have always grown up with\nparents that work a lot. They are both in very
        creative fields. One is in wine and the other is in\nadvertising. My children
        grew up, I think, knowing that if you love something, you\u2019ll be really\ngood
        at it, and if you work really hard at it, all the better. And you have to
        work at something\nthat regenerates energy so you can\u2019t go work on an
        island in a room with a door that\u2019s closed.\nThey\u2019re very creative.
        They\u2019re very personable. I think they could do anything.\nAW: I think
        that\u2019s a really important message to learn early on, having the opportunity
        to do\nanything you want. I like what you said about art that it regenerates
        energy. It\u2019s something that\nyou give and get. Let\u2019s shift gears
        a little bit and talk about how you got to the St. Croix River\nValley area.
        When did you decide to move to the area?\nCMC: I didn\u2019t. I actually married
        Fuller and Fuller had this house, and that was in \u201991 and I think\nI
        first came out here in 1990. When did the pottery tour start?\nAW: I\u2019m
        just drawing a blank at the moment. I think this year was the twenty-second
        year?\nCMC: Or, twenty-first, I don\u2019t know. I was not in it the first
        year. I was in it the second year and\nit was because of Bob Briscoe. I lived
        here. Bob and I were both on the advisory board of the\nNorthern Clay Center.
        We were part of the initial team in starting that. We are very like in kind\nthinkers.
        I\u2019m very opinionated. Bob wanted me to be part of this group. I\u2019m
        not much of a group\nperson, but I went, \u201cSure.\u201d Over the years
        Bob\u2019s had to calm me down and keep me in it. There\nare times when I
        don\u2019t want to be in it. Whenever it started, I did it the second year.\nAW:
        Why did you want to be part of it? In the second year I think still there
        was a lot to be\nfigured out.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n21\nCMC:
        There were like thirty or forty people who came. Why did I want to be in it?
        I just did it\nbecause Bob wanted me to.\nAW: How did you get to know Bob?\nCMC:
        I don\u2019t remember. Just through the clay community, clay world. When we
        were on the\nadvisory board of Northern Clay I think is when I really learned
        a lot about him because you\nheard what people fought for and that\u2019s
        when I started liking him a lot. He\u2019s a very community\nminded, very
        generous guy. He really thinks about how is this going to affect the whole.
        How\ncan we make that happen. There are a lot of people who are on the pottery
        tour who just do not\nhave that kind of vision.\n01:20:15\nAW: Why do you
        think he has that vision?\nCMC: Drinks a lot of beer, I don\u2019t know (laughs)\nAW:
        Just to back up\u2014before you moved here were you living in Minneapolis?\nCMC:
        Yes, yes. I lived in St. Anthony Park. I lived in a converted fire station.
        Half of it was my\nstudio and half of it was our house.\nAW: Did you buy it
        that way or did you set it up?\nCMC: No, I bought it as a fire station and
        converted it. I bought it from the city in 1979.\nAW: Was it difficult to
        have a ceramics studio in the city?\nCMC: Mm-hmm.\nAW: What were some of the
        issues or challenges?\nCMC: You don\u2019t want to know. [Laughs]. It was
        really finding a building that you could have\na\u2014I had a hundred cubic
        foot gas kiln in the building and so it was finding a building that was\nconducive
        to that within the city borders. That building happened to be on a busy street,
        so it was\nbordering commercial but it was in residential. It could be split.
        I was looking for old grocery\nstores in Northeast and this building came
        up. I was looking for an odd building that I could\nmake a studio\/house.\nAW:
        You said you were in St. Anthony Park then. What was that area like in the
        Eighties?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n22\nCMC:
        It\u2019s not that different than it is now. St. Anthony Park is a lot of
        university people. The fire\nstation is in South St. Anthony Park, so it\u2019s
        more working class. It\u2019s just like a little bridge that\nseparates the
        college world from the working-class world. And I was on the edge of the working-class\nworld.
        I actually loved it. There was a park right in front of the house. There was
        a co-op\nkiddy corner. It was a great place to have a house and a studio.\nAW:
        Were there many fellow artists or colleagues around the area?\nCMC: No, but
        now it\u2019s becoming actually a corridor for artists. There was a co-op
        called Film in\nthe Cities that was two blocks away. That doesn\u2019t exist
        anymore, but that was the only other arts\nthing. Northern Clay ended moving
        there and then they moved away. Joe Brown has a gallery\nthere\u2014Raymond
        Street Gallery.\nAW: When you met Fuller and you moved out here\u2014what
        were you thinking at the time?\nCMC: I can have a compost. I like being in
        the country. I like being in nature.\nAW: You were excited to be here then?\nCMC:
        I like New York City. If I\u2019m going to be in a city I want it to be a
        city. I like it to be a lot\nof action and really fast or things I\u2019m
        not familiar with. Or, I like to wake up to animal sounds, to\ngardens, to
        a place to put my banana peels. I like the serenity. Also, I don\u2019t want
        people visiting\nme. If you\u2019re in a studio and you come to chat, I can\u2019t
        work. I want to work.\nAW: This is such a beautiful setting. Did you, together,
        design parts of this house and also the\ngardens?\nCMC: Yeah.\nAW: Fuller
        helped start the Franconia Sculpture Park. Was that already up and running
        when\nyou moved here?\nCMC: I don\u2019t know how old that is. It\u2019s maybe
        twenty years old. Fuller and his college\nroommate started it.\n01:25:15\nAW:
        Was there a kind of metal sculpture community here as well as ceramics?\nCMC:
        No, nothing. They started with the idea that it would be like a living workshop
        for young\nsculptors to come in, to have a venue to show their work. For two
        years you could come and you\ncould participate, you could be a student, you
        could work with the sculptors that were on site.\nAfter two years you could
        take your work away, destroy it, if it sells, fine, you get the money.\nIt\u2019s
        always been free. That\u2019s pretty much the way it\u2019s run.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n23\nAW: When you
        first came here was there a strong sense of community amongst potters? Were\nthere
        many potters in the area?\nCMC: Was there a strong sense of community among
        potters? I would say no. I think that Bob\nBriscoe\u2014that line, that connection,
        Mack [Warren MacKenzie] was part of it in the beginning.\nYou could draw a
        line\u2014Warren, Jeff Oestreich, Bob, myself. I think Linda Christianson
        was in\nit. There was another guy, Richard Abnet, who died.\nIn terms of the
        pottery tour, there are a lot of potters who have hence moved up in this way
        and\nthey all want to be part of this tour. We\u2019re actually very guarded
        about not making it too big\nbecause it\u2019s already quite a lot of work
        to get to all the studios. People copy our logo. They name\ntheir name similar
        to our name. It\u2019s really kind of ridiculous. That\u2019s not in the spirit
        of how\npotters work. I don\u2019t like that. Why not define yourself in a
        different way? In the meantime, this\npottery tour, which I\u2019m sure that
        Bob could tell you much more about, has really been a model\nfor a lot of
        pottery tours around the country.\nOne of the things that we do that I feel
        very strongly about is we have a philanthropic corner to\nthe Tour where we
        give a small amount of money to something that is promoting ceramics.\nAlthough,
        this can be a controversial issue. It started out where we gave five percent
        of\neverything that we made. When people started making a lot of money they
        started looking at the\ncheck they were writing and going, \u201cI\u2019m
        not rich. Why am I writing such a big check?\u201d We had\ndiscussions, \u201cWell,
        it\u2019s sort of like taxes. You\u2019re writing a big check because you\u2019re
        all of\nsudden making a lot of money.\u201d The correlation just broke down.
        So instead we set a set amount\nof money that the pottery tour would give
        every year.\nAW: What were some of the organizations that you\u2019ve given
        money to?\nCMC: We\u2019ve given to the Weisman Museum. We\u2019ve given to
        the Rochester Art Center. We\u2019ve\ngiven to Northern Clay Center. We\u2019ve
        given to different local schools to build their ceramics\nprograms. We\u2019ve
        given to Potters for Peace. We have a list that you could look at.\nAW: How
        do you guys decide?\nCMC: We have a meeting and vote.\nAW: Has there been
        an organization or cause that you were really passionate about donating to\nover
        the years?\nCMC: Me personally, I\u2019m interested in organizations that
        have the biggest outreach. I\u2019m much\nmore interested in a museum or university
        program where it\u2019s going to have a big domino effect\nthan a little country
        school where you\u2019re going to affect twenty students. But I think that
        they\u2019re\nboth important. I think our tour has a big effect on the little
        country school that has twenty\nstudents because they come here en masse and
        the students all sit around and, you know, their\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n24\nsenior project is find out why
        Connee is a potter? They\u2019re little sponges at that age. They want to\nknow.
        They don\u2019t know what they want to do.\n01:30:25\nAW: Have you worked
        with local students?\nCMC: No, I don\u2019t work with anybody. I work with
        Brenda who you met, who worked on a farm.\nI mean, yes, in my life have I
        worked with students? Yes.\nAW: Can you tell me a little bit more about those
        first years when you guys were developing the\nTour? How did you get it up
        and running?\nCMC: I think, actually, for those questions, other people will
        be more helpful. I don\u2019t know that I\npay attention to it. Bob would
        be the quintessential person to look at. I think Linda also would be\nhelpful
        and Guillermo will have big opinions about that. I think Jeff will kind of
        go, I don\u2019t\nknow, and I\u2019m sort of like that. I think it just evolved.
        Bob was always thinking about ways to\nget bigger audiences. I know that Bob
        and I made a big push to put it on public radio a few years\nago, which we
        finally did because everybody tended to not want to ever pay money for any\nadvertising.
        One of the intentions is to keep the costs of it really low for the participating
        artists.\nI think one of the beauties of the Tour is that we create the space
        for each studio to operate the\nway they want to independently. We have general
        parameters\u2014I think you can\u2019t have more than\neight or nine artists
        so that it doesn\u2019t get too enormous so there\u2019s not thirty people
        at one studio\nand two at another. But, you don\u2019t have to have visiting
        artists if you don\u2019t want to. Another\nmust do is that anybody that\u2019s
        showing in the studio tour has to be there. I think that\u2019s a really\ngood
        rule. I lots of times will invite people from California and they will say,
        \u201cWell we can send\nwork.\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo, you have
        to be there.\u201d Part of the idea is our old fashioned notion of\nwhat potters
        do and what they are. It\u2019s nice to meet the maker. I don\u2019t know
        that painters would\never have a criteria like that\u2014at a painting show,
        the painters have to be there. Maybe they\u2019d\nsay, \u201cIt\u2019s nice,
        maybe they\u2019ll sell more work.\u201d But here, it\u2019s required.\nAW:
        Do you think that that sets the Tour apart from other tours?\nCMC: I don\u2019t
        know. I don\u2019t know how other tours operate. I don\u2019t know if other
        tours require\nthat or not. We require that we give money to a non-profit,
        that\u2019s another requirement. Generally,\nit\u2019s required that it is
        about functional pottery. It gets a little furry because I paint. I will show\npaintings
        next to the pot because they\u2019re definitely in relationship. Sometimes
        the paintings are\non the pots. So whether it\u2019s 2D or 3D, you know, I
        think it\u2019s silly to differentiate. Fuller and I\ncollaborate and do glass
        and metal chandeliers. We\u2019ll make a piece like that where that has clay\nin
        it, Fuller did the metalwork and I\u2019ll show that at the show. We\u2019ll
        do a chandelier like that and\nit\u2019s metalwork like that and we\u2019ve
        commissioned a glass blower to make stems of glass\u2014I won\u2019t\nshow
        that in the show because it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with clay. It\u2019s
        not a hard and fast\nline. Will Swanson\u2019s wife does this carving called
        Netsuke which is like these little wood, very\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n25\nelaborate things. Even though
        she\u2019s not advertised her work is shown in the Tour. I think it\nmakes
        it interesting. We don\u2019t advertise Netsuke as part of what this is. We
        want it to be simple.\nWe want it to be about pots.\nThere\u2019s also really
        different set-ups. The way I set up my studio and this again, I really like
        that\nyou can set up the studio the way you want. I have seven artists. Everybody
        has their own space\nor their own tent. You go see, you know, this is Liz\u2019s
        work, this is Mark\u2019s work, this is Curt\u2019s\nwork. Guillermo takes
        all of his artists and puts out fifteen tables and mixes them all up. That\u2019s\nmuch
        more of a Warren MacKenzie idea\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter who made it. My
        idea is if you see\nfifty pieces of somebody\u2019s work you\u2019re going
        to understand their work a lot more than if it\u2019s all\nmixed up. It is
        going to be hard for you to really go, \u201cOh, now I can identify the work.\u201d
        I like\nthat continuity. I also like to invite the same artists back because
        they build up a clientele. My\nartists lots of time are coming from far away.
        If they\u2019re driving all the way from the East Coast\n,and if somebody
        is looking at a piece of Liz\u2019s or Shoko\u2019s and they go, \u201cWell,
        I thought about it\nand this year I\u2019m ready to buy something.\u201d That\u2019s
        very true for me and my clients. They\u2019ll walk\nin and see a set of dishes
        and go, \u201cWow,\u201d and two years later they\u2019re ordering them. They
        don\u2019t\nthe first time they see them.\n01:37:00\nAW: How do you come to
        select your guest artists? How do you decide?\nCMC: A lot of people write
        to us. A lot of people that are teachers send images on the computer,\n\u201cLook
        at this person\u2019s work.\u201d I look at work when I\u2019m out and about
        to see what I like. I write\ndown a name if it seems interesting and then
        I\u2019m very limited to the number of people. Also, I\nmight like one piece
        that they make but then I look at twenty different pieces and the piece that
        I\nsaw might be the only thing that I like. Or, it doesn\u2019t matter what
        they make it all looks like\u2014the\ncup looks like the vase looks like the
        casserole and then I\u2019m bored so then I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m\nlooking
        for somebody\u2014in this studio all of my artists have very individualistic
        styles which I\nthink are quite painterly or sculptural, but definitely conceptual.\nAW:
        Can you give us an example of one of your guest artists and why you selected
        them?\nCMC: Mark Pharis. His pieces are very architectural. You don\u2019t
        look at one of his vases and go,\n\u201cOh, daisies would look pretty in that.\u201d
        You see the form and the form is very strong and the\nform is accentuated
        by the way it is glazed. It\u2019s not like, Oh I have fifty pieces, dunk
        them all in\nyellow. You know, Jenny Mendes\u2014they are little stories,
        paintings. They\u2019re paintings on clay.\nAW: Which guest artist has been
        with you the longest?\nCMC: Amy died. Gail Kendall isn\u2019t there any more.
        Let me think. Maybe Liz Quackenbush?\nLiz, Shoko, Jenny, Ani, Mark, Curt.
        Liz Quackenbush.\nAW: When did she join?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC.
        Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n26\nCMC: I don\u2019t know, maybe twelve years
        ago or something? She was a student of Gail Kendall\u2019s\nwho was one of
        my visiting artists who was showing with me up until two years ago. Gail\nKendall
        has been a friend for forty years. Curt Hoard I was married to. Jenny Mendes\u2014I
        bought\nsome of her work at a show in Chicago twenty years ago and is one
        of the only artists whose\nwork that I own that I had never had met her. Bob
        said, \u201cWould you be interested in her being in\nthe Tour?\u201d And I
        said, \u201cYeah.\u201d That\u2019s how I met Jenny and Jenny brought Shoko.
        Ani Kasten,\nthat\u2019s the woman that does that very volatile stuff under
        the lilacs [refers to piece in her\ncollection], that actually was a Bob Briscoe,
        \u201cThere\u2019s an artist named Ani Kasten and I think\nyou\u2019d really
        like her work.\u201d But you have to know that Bob sends me twenty images
        like that.\nWhen I saw Ani\u2019s work I\u2018m like, Absolutely, and I called
        her that minute. I said, \u201cDo you want\nto do it?\u201d She said, \u201cI
        don\u2019t know,\u201d and she called me back after making ten phone calls
        and\nsaid, \u201cYes,\u201d because we get a million people who want to do
        this.\nAW: Do you have some criteria involved that you\u2019ve developed or
        just kind of an instinct--?\nCMC: No, it\u2019s just an instinct. Ani\u2019s
        work has a lot of integrity to it. I loved that about it. I love\nthe honesty
        of it. I love the integrity of it.\n01:41:45\nAW: Where are your guest artists
        from? Are they from all over or from Minnesota?\nCMC: Hmm-mm, all over.\nAW:
        Where are some of the places? You said some on the East Coast--?\nCMC: Liz
        is from Pennsylvania. Shoko is from North Carolina, I think. Jenny is from
        Virginia,\nsomewhere on the East Coast. Mark is from Wisconsin, somewhere.
        Liz, Mark, Connee, Curt is\nfrom Minneapolis. Shoko, Ani, Jenny\u2014that\u2019s
        it.\nAW: Where is Ani from?\nCMC: Somewhere on the East Coast, New York maybe?\nAW:
        When you\u2019re setting up for the Tour do you have any traditions? What
        is it like here?\nCMC: What is it like here? We are preparing. We make black
        bean soup for about two thousand\npeople. We do that before the artists come.
        Just stock the house with groceries and order the tents\nand make sure the
        tents are set up. I require that all my artists come in by Wednesday unless\nthey\u2019re
        local then Thursday\u2014I want everybody set up by Thursday morning, Thursday
        at noon.\nThe Tour starts Friday morning but I run that the same way I have
        a party. I don\u2019t like things\ndone at the last minute. So lots of times
        we are walking around to the other potteries looking at\npots and other people
        are unloading their kilns and we\u2019re completely set up. We have a potters\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n27\ndinner
        every year at this house. About ninety people come. We have it catered. Bob
        Briscoe has\na big campfire and dinner one night. We will have a dinner just
        with our own group and their\nsignificant others one night. Then Sunday night
        Will Swanson organizes a pizza party at a local\nbar but most of us are too
        tired, or it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and I have kids so I don\u2019t usually
        do that.\nSo, yeah, those traditions.\nAW: What is it like when you have the
        dinner with guest artists, is that a good time to connect\nwith people? Sounds
        like people come regularly--?\nCMC: Yeah, it\u2019s hugely meaningful. For
        the most part these people are academics. Shoko\nteaches at Alfred\u2014does
        she teach at Alfred? She teaches somewhere. They teach, they have\nfamilies,
        so I think this is just a paid holiday. They\u2019re making money but it\u2019s
        just really fun for\nthem. It\u2019s fun to be exposed to so many potters.
        I think they like being here a lot.\n01:45:35\nAW: What are some of your fondest
        memories of the Tour?\nCMC: When it\u2019s over. [Laughs]. I like seeing young
        kids come in and consider that this is\nsomething that they actually could
        do in the world. I also think in a world that is so techy\noriented I like
        seeing the pleasure that people in the community just get out of the fact
        that there\nare so many people doing things that are handmade. I like when
        people come to this studio that\npeople are exposed to so many different attitudes,
        which you\u2019re not in Minnesota. I don\u2019t have a\nspecific, you know,
        \u201cThis person came jumping over the fire and ate a marshmallow,\u201d
        I don\u2019t\nhave an idea about something specifically that happened.\nAW:
        Is that a story that somebody shares\u2014somebody jumping over the fire?\nCMC:
        No, no. I don\u2019t know. My tenth grade algebra teacher came one year and
        said, \u201cDo you\nremember me?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my god,
        yes,\u201d you know, that kind of thing, but that happens\nin Minnesota no
        matter what you do, you can be at the grocery store. I do it because Bob Briscoe\nmakes
        me do it. I do it because it\u2019s really a very positive community act that
        I feel that we\u2019ve\ninvented. I think that we haven\u2019t designed ourselves\u2014[question
        about recorder]\u2014I don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019ve designed ourselves or
        fashioned ourselves after anyone else. We\u2019ve really just sat down\nand
        hammered out, \u201cWell, this would be a good idea, well this wouldn\u2019t,
        well this feels good,\nwell this doesn\u2019t.\u201d I like that process.\nAW:
        That kind of group decision-making?\nCMC: Hmm-mm.\nAW: Have there been significant
        challenges along the way?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n28\nCMC:
        I think one of the challenges for me was when the Tour was questioning whether
        we\nshould be philanthropic. I felt that people were getting to be too small
        in their thinking and I\ndidn\u2019t like that. I think that also one of the
        challenges has been to keep the Tour from not getting\ntoo big. So, not wanting
        to be elitist\u2014it\u2019s the opposite of what the group wants to be\u2014but
        when\na lot of people want to be part of it how do you keep it small and not
        appear to be elitist? I think\nthat it\u2019s really hard when young struggling
        artists come to you and they want a venue. For me,\nit\u2019s not something
        that I can do once. I always keep thinking I\u2019ll have one person that\u2019s
        rotating\nand, actually, I thought Ani would be it and the minute Ani came
        I was like, I can\u2019t rotate her\nout. I\u2019m not good at doing that.
        But, Lois Moran who used to be the editor of American Craft\nMagazine\u2014she\u2019s
        a friend. I used to be on the American Craft Council. I was on that board
        for\nsix years. Lois came once and stayed here and saw the Tour and her criticism
        was, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave enough young rookies in the field.\u201d It\u2019s
        a valid criticism and I don\u2019t know how to address it.\nWe\u2019ve talked
        about having emerging artists but haven\u2019t figured out how to do that
        yet. A salon\nde refus\u00e9s.\n01:50:18\nAW: When did you start inviting
        guest artists?\nCMC: I don\u2019t know the answer to that because that was
        not the case in the beginning. I don\u2019t\nknow. Bob would be a person who
        would know that. Bob is our historian.\nAW: Sounds like that was a first step
        to bringing new people in? Now there\u2019s another discussion\nhappening
        about bringing in more new artists?\nCMC: Well, not really. Lois brought that
        up a half a dozen years ago and I brought that to the\ngroup and everybody
        agreed but we haven\u2019t figured out really what to do about it.\nAW: Other
        challenges that face the Tour? What are some of the biggest successes of the
        Tour?\nWhy has it become a model for others?\nCMC: Well, it draws an incredible
        amount of people. It draws people from all over the country\nand sometimes
        out of the country. I think one of the biggest successes of the Tour is you
        really\ngo to the studios and you look at the work and you really get a sense
        of why we all became\npotters to begin with. You\u2019re meeting people that
        invest their lives in making things by hand.\nThat\u2019s their commitment.
        Their commitment isn\u2019t to mass-produce these objects. I can\u2019t even
        tell\nyou how many times I have had people ask me if I want to produce something
        and have Pottery\nBarn or Crate and Barrel make it, or go to India or go to
        China and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what\nI do this for.\u201d
        This is, for me, a real affirmation of the makers and the people that want
        these\nobjects in their lives and it\u2019s a notion of life that existed
        for me when I started doing it.\nAW: Are there regular visitors who come to
        your studio?\nCMC: Yeah.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n29\nAW:
        Can you give us some examples of who they are? Are they from the Midwest?
        Are they\nfrom all over? Who are some of the people you look forward to seeing
        each year? Who are\nregular visitors?\nCMC: Boy, some of them are museum curators,
        collectors, that come from different places.\nSome of them are from here,
        you know, people who have an obsession with clay, a love affair\nwith clay.
        I\u2019m one of them. Look at my house. If I\u2019m in France or India or
        Turkey\u2014I\u2019m looking\nfor the potter. I\u2019m looking for the weaver.
        I\u2019m looking for the painter. I\u2019m not looking for the\nLouis Vuitton
        store.\nAW: Have you done much traveling and done workshops? Or, had a chance
        to produce ceramics\nin other countries?\nCMC: I have no interest. I\u2019ve
        gone to India and thrown pots with Indian potters but that\u2019s really\nto
        show them that little old ladies from America can center clay and they\u2019re
        like dumbfounded\nthat somebody like me can sit in a squat and throw a pot
        on their big piece of stone. They\u2019re\ntaking pictures with their cell
        phones, you know, talking Hindi. But, no. There are people who do\nthat\u2014who
        go to Japan and go to places and do workshops. I\u2019m not a workshop person.
        That\u2019s\nexhausting to me. I just want to go to my studio. That\u2019s
        another form of teaching.\n01:55:05\nAW: Seems like some of your training
        started in Colorado and then happened here in Minnesota\nand then just a lot
        of your own work on it. So, you didn\u2019t travel to do any training?\nCMC:
        No. Painting? New York. I think that very early on, once one decides to be
        an artist, that\neverything you do is a teacher whether you\u2019re weeding
        your garden or taking a walk in the\nwoods or in a museum in Paris. It\u2019s
        all food. And, it all comes out and then you couple that with\nyour emotional
        disposition of whatever you\u2019re going through at that time in your life
        and it\u2019s an\nendless supply of things to talk about.\nAW: You started
        this interview talking about how food was an inspiration, making things that\nwould
        go well with showing food and flowers. Is that still something that inspires
        you or are\nthere other inspirations that are shaping your work? Or passions?\nCMC:
        I guess I used to be more specific. I think that cheesecake was the beginning
        note. The\nother one was that I came from a Jewish family and I made a soup
        bowl that I thought would be\nperfect for matzo ball soup. I was in the Renaissance
        Art Fair\u2014I think the first or second year\nthat it opened\u2014and the
        person that bought that bowl was a nun and she bought it for holy water.\nI
        remember just laughing, thinking, Oh my god, there I go, you know, so much
        for, like, what I\nthink it should be used for. That was my first lesson of\u2014it\u2019s
        great that you can have this idea but\nit might not be someone else\u2019s
        interpretation or idea.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n30\nI
        think that going to painting school has taught me to look at surface really
        differently. Going to\npainting school as a potter I looked at a two-dimensional
        surface as three-dimensional because\nit\u2019s really how I always saw things,
        as three-dimensional. I was always really aware of negative\nspace. I was
        always aware of how something sits in space because that\u2019s what my head
        sideways\nwas always looking at. Part of my training was when you\u2019re
        going on the surface of the pot, how\ndo you integrate the surface so that
        it becomes one so you don\u2019t notice the surface separate from\nthe form?
        I think going to painting school just made that conversation more sophisticated.
        I\u2019m\nmuch more aware of surface and if I\u2019m just putting layers and
        layers of texture\u2014I look at it as a\npainting rather than just layers
        of slip. Now I have been trained to not arbitrarily do anything\nwithout being
        responsible for it being there.\nI think in the beginning, when I was in a
        University class with Curt, you know, you would leave\nthrowing marks on a
        piece. He would say, \u201cWhy did you leave the throwing marks?\u201d If
        your\nanswer was, \u201cJust \u2018cause,\u201d that was not acceptable. If
        you want me to see the throwing marks,\nbecause I see them, than you\u2019re
        intentionally putting them. If they\u2019re not important to your piece,\nget
        rid of them. If they are important to your piece, have them do something.
        Don\u2019t just tell me\nabout process, like, I will go to sleep within a
        second. That was the beginning of that\nconversation about being responsible
        for surface. Working in a painting studio and putting my\nbrush in brown paint
        and then putting it back in brown paint and the teacher saying, \u201cAre
        you\ndoing that again because you want it or because the paint is right there
        and you\u2019re just doing it\nbecause you\u2019re lazy. So, look at Van Gogh,\u201d
        and then out the books come and you\u2019re looking at\nVan Gogh, and you\u2019re
        looking at Titian, and you\u2019re looking at Cezanne and you\u2019re looking
        at the\nway they put every color application. None of it was mindless. It
        might have been intuitive, but it\nwasn\u2019t mindless. It is a very unconscious
        intuitive act but it isn\u2019t without intention.\nThen there\u2019s firing,
        there\u2019s gas firing. You can intend pieces to look a certain way. You
        can\nintend the glazes to look a certain way, and then whether there\u2019s
        a full moon or whether the\nfiring happened the way it happened, it changes.
        That teaches all potters a lot about control. You\ncan say, \u201cThis is
        what I want,\u201d but then there\u2019s an element of you getting what has
        come out.\nMore often than not it\u2019s actually to our advantage that it
        will come out a certain way. It was a\npleasant surprise and then you take
        that and you start with your next thing. What you don\u2019t know\nis often
        what you start with.\n02:01:45\nAW: I think that\u2019s so interesting that
        story you were just telling about\u2014after all that process, you\nknow,
        you start with a vision, then you put on the glaze, it goes into a firing
        and you\u2019re not\nentirely sure how it will turn out, and then I\u2019m
        just thinking of that Matzo ball soup bowl that\nbecame a bowl for holy water.\nCMC:
        Yeah, or you\u2019re positive that you know how it will turn out and it doesn\u2019t.
        All of these\nthings in your studio are life lessons. That\u2019s why it\u2019s
        such a luxury to be an artist because your\nsynchronicity with the rest of
        your life, it all becomes very fluid. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing
        one\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n31\nthing
        in your work, and another thing with your children, and another thing with
        your husband.\nIt\u2019s all the same mixing bowl.\nAW: That\u2019s very true.
        It is interesting because it feels that way being a student too. Everything\nrevolves
        around learning. We\u2019ve covered a lot of the questions. There are just
        a few follow-up\nquestions here. Before the Tour, how did the public interact
        with your work?\nCMC: Before the Tour\u2014I don\u2019t know if the public
        has ever\u2014\nAW: Well, how did you show your work?\nCMC: I used to show
        my work in galleries around the country.\nAW: Locally as well?\nCMC: Yes,
        there was one gallery locally that I showed with.\nAW: Which gallery was this?\nCMC:
        It was called By Design. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\nAW: Since the Tour,
        how has that changed in showing your work?\nCMC: The Tour didn\u2019t really
        change that. I decided that galleries were too political and too\ntaxing and
        also, by that time, I was twenty-some years into my career and I had enough\ncommissions
        that I didn\u2019t need to operate like that anymore. I do a lot of commission
        work\u2014\nmore commission work than straight out sales. People learn of
        my work and interact from my\nwork because they see something somewhere else
        and say, \u201cOh, where did you get that? Who\nmade that?\u201d Or, they
        see my work somewhere and then that becomes a client. That\u2019s really how\nmy
        work is out in the world. I have a show once a year in October\u2014it used
        to be in December\u2014\nactually I have two shows. One here and one in town
        and then this show, and those are the three\nshows I have.\n02:05:12\nAW:
        Did the Tour help you meet people who would commission work or did you already
        have\nthose clients?\nCMC: The Tour for me is more about bringing in artists
        and generally enriching a community\nconversation.\nAW: Since the Tour began,
        how has a community\u2014you\u2019ve said a couple of times a community\nconversation\u2014who
        makes up the potters community now in this area, the St. Croix River\nValley?\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n32\nCMC:
        The people on this tour. There are a lot of ceramists in the Wisconsin\/Minnesota
        area who\nare not on this tour who are really good. Northern Clay Center might
        be more representative of\nwho the potters are but they aren\u2019t of the
        St. Croix River Valley necessarily. Minnesota and\nWisconsin are really, really
        rich in different kinds of ceramists. That clay community exists. The\nWeisman
        museum would be a flagship, a mouthpiece, because they have a ceramics thing.\nNorthern
        Clay Center. Those two organizations. We have White Bear Arts Center, Edina
        Arts\nCenter, Minnetonka Arts Center, all of these things have ceramics. There
        is a big clay\ncommunity\u2014we are a pottery tour that happens to be located
        here and we identify ourselves by a\nlocation. The difference would be all
        of the hosts\u2014even if all of the hosts aren\u2019t necessarily\nacclaimed
        professional ceramicists\u2014have people of substantial reputation at their
        potteries.\nThere isn\u2019t any host station that doesn\u2019t have really
        good potters there. It\u2019s very unusual in that\nway.\nAW: Unusual to have
        that amount of well-known potters all together? When you say,\n\u201ccommunity
        conversation,\u201d can you tell me more? What kind of conversation?\nCMC:
        Awareness of pots, of ceramics being at a higher level of aesthetic, a different
        level of\naesthetic, which maybe this studio brings to light more than others
        because the Mingei pottery\nconversation that Warren has popularized so much
        in this area is a very valid outlet, but, you\nknow, we tend to be really
        focused on that in this area so a lot of collectors or makers get really\nexcited
        to see that there are other venues that you might go down. Then as I said,
        school children\ncoming in and the parents telling them, \u201cDon\u2019t
        touch,\u201d and we\u2019re saying, \u201cActually, we want\nthem to touch.\u201d\nAW:
        What do you think the Tour has meant for the larger Minnesota community?\nCMC:
        I have no idea. Ask Guillermo and Bob that question. They\u2019re much more
        apt to answer it\nwell.\nAW: What has the Tour meant for the guest artists?\nCMC:
        I think a lot. I think they make connections. I think they sell a lot of work.
        I think they get\na lot of clients. I think it\u2019s huge. I\u2019ve never
        had a guest artist that didn\u2019t want to come back.\n02:10:05\nAW: You
        touched on this a little bit but are there things that make the St. Croix
        River Valley\npotter\u2019s community unique?\nCMC: I think the things that
        I said\u2014we\u2019re philanthropic, you have to be here, it\u2019s somewhere
        in\nthis location, we have guest artists.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC.
        Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n33\nAW: What about a community itself? Do you
        see a cohesive potters community here or as you\nsaid earlier its more about
        individuals coming together for this tour?\nCMC: The hosts\u2014we all know
        each other and I would say genuinely for the most part like each\nother. I
        don\u2019t know that I want to have dinner with everybody that is a host.\nAW:
        When you first started Warren was part of this and you had taken classes with
        Warren. Was\nCurt ever part of the Tour?\nCMC: Just as my guest.\nAW: What
        was it like to host a tour with a former teacher? Or was that not--?\nCMC:
        There\u2019s a lot of Warren worship in the area and I\u2019m not one that
        has it. Warren is just\nanother guy to me. It was fine. He is more in sync
        in a way with the way Guillermo is going to\noperate, or even Bob, you know,
        than the way I operate. I\u2019m probably the odd man out. I\u2019m\ntrying
        to think if there\u2019s any other studio. I don\u2019t know if Richard Vincent
        has a point of view\nwith his studio. Linda definitely is a fan of Warren\u2019s
        but Linda will have different kinds of\npotters at her studio, as does Bob.
        Guillermo is very devoted to Warren\u2019s teachings. I mean,\nWarren, you
        know, I love that Warren has brought so much to the area and he\u2019s, you
        know, he\u2019s\nan old potter. He loves it. He makes beautiful pots and he\u2019s
        made a huge contribution. He\u2019s put\nthis area on the map in many ways
        in pottery.\nAW: Do you feel like the Tour has done that as well? Has the
        Tour helped to bring attention to\nthe area? How might you see that?\nCMC:
        Yeah, totally, by the fact that four thousand people come to it.\nAW: Well,
        I asked about teachers because when we first came in you showed us right away\nPeter\u2019s
        work and then his students work and, though it seems like teaching hasn\u2019t
        been\nsomething you\u2019ve pursued, it seems important to you.\nCMC: So many
        ceramists were teachers. They just were. It\u2019s how they supported their
        habit. It\u2019s\nmuch more common than not. I could show you Warren\u2019s
        work and Curt\u2019s work and I\u2019m one of\ntheir students and I can show
        you there other\u2014this house is filled with all of that, you know, so\nsure.\nAW:
        I find that really interesting that you have that message there. You see these
        linkages, these\nnetworks, these connections from one artist to the next.\nCMC:
        Yeah, well they kind of all learned from each other in one way or another.\n02:14:45\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\n06\/02\/14\n34\nAW:
        As kind of a final reflective question, what are your hopes for the Tour in
        the future?\nCMC: What are my hopes for the Tour in the future? I guess I
        was supposed to read these\nquestions and think about them. I would hope that
        the Tour can plant a seed for prospective\npeople that are wanting to do something
        as crazy as making ceramics as a vocation, as a\npossibility. Or, that the
        public is reminded of the integrity that is in handmade objects. We live in\na
        fast paced technical world where the bottom line is about dollars. This is
        not about that. This is\nlike going to a music fest. This is a different conversation.
        It is reminding people about a very\nbasic thing that everybody has which
        is a creative core and this is expressed through clay. The\nTour is another
        vehicle for that message. As long as the Tour can deliver that I think it
        will be\nsuccessful.\nAW: Do you see over time that new hosts will join the
        Tour? How might that change in the next\nten, twenty years?\nCMC: I don\u2019t
        know, probably. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to do it for another ten
        or twenty years. So\nyes, I think logistically you could just have so many
        people doing it and if I drop out than maybe\nsomebody five miles away can
        say, \u201cCan I be in it?\u201d\nAW: Are there elements of the Tour that
        you hope will continue in the future?\nCMC: I think things evolve and change
        and what is true for me is going to be different for what\u2019s\nin the future.
        I don\u2019t have aspirations for how I think it should be.\nAW: Thank you
        so much for sharing all these stories and memories and thoughts with us.\nCMC:
        Sure.\nAW: Is there anything else you want to say or anything else we should
        know about the Tour or\nanything else about your involvement in the history
        of the Tour?\nCMC: I don\u2019t think so, I think it\u2019s been pretty extensive.\n02:18:49\nEND

        Richard Vincent on June 9th, 2014 in North Branch, Minnesota, at his house.
        This interview is for the \u201cA Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of
        the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,\u201d made possible by the Minnesota
        Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Also present during this interview
        is Tierney McNabb, Project Assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.
        Why don\u2019t we get started?\nFirst if you could tell us about when and
        where you were born? Where you grew up?\nRV: Sure. I was born in St. Paul,
        Minnesota, grew up in White Bear Lake, suburban kid of a white, blue-collar
        family. I was the last of a family of four with older parents who were not
        highly engaged with me, so I had a lot of freedom. I spent a lot of time in
        kind of wild places and gathered a real love and interest in nature that evolved
        into being involved with creative expressions, artistic expressions, towards
        nature motifs, so-to-speak.\nAW: So where were you exploring around in your
        childhood? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n2\nRV:
        Well, it was just our neighborhood. Oddly enough, we had swamp fields, or
        fields across the street with woods and the lake. I was very much involved
        with swimming and bike-riding. I\u2019d bike ride for hours, just go around
        the various lakes: White Bear Lake and Bald Eagle, and that just essentially
        was it. Until I grew up older, I really got a drive for travel. I wanted to
        explore the world that way and I did some of that.\nAW: When did you decide
        to start traveling?\nRV: In high school, I decided I really wanted to get
        out and see the world.\nAW: Where did you go?\nRV: Well, I first went to the
        western states, hiking and backpacking\u2014the Tetons, came back from that
        trip and wanted to do more. Took a car trip with one young friend of mine,
        a woman friend of mine in high school, and went to the western states, down
        the coast and stuff. But after that I realized that my desire wasn\u2019t
        fulfilled, I wanted to do more backpacking, and it was more of a car camping
        trip. So I pursued more money and then traveled for like nine months. Backpacking
        in the western states, in national parks, Grand Canyon, and went to Mexico
        for close to five months. Then it was after that I decided to go back to school.\nMaybe
        we want to go to my first interest in pottery then?\nAW: Sure, if you want
        to go ahead, yeah.\nRV: (Laughs) Seems like we\u2019re going off on a trail\u2014\nAW:
        This is good background material, so unless you want to jump right into that,
        there\u2019s a few more questions I have. When were you born?\nRV: It was
        1955.\nAW: 1955, okay, and you mentioned that you had three older siblings?\nRV:
        Yes.\nAW: Did they also enjoy outdoors and nature?\nRV: Well, two of them
        were almost a generation or half a generation ahead of me, so I didn\u2019t
        spend that much time with them. The younger one that was just closest to me,
        we did spend a lot of time together. She ended up doing things that I wanted
        to do. Probably was an impetus for me to kind of grab a hold of traveling
        too.\nAW: When you took off for your travels in the western states what were
        some of your first impressions? Had you been out of Minnesota before then?\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n3\nRV: I had,
        with the family some, a little bit.\nAW: Yeah.\nRV: Well I was thrilled to
        be able to backpack in the mountains and hang out on the seashore and such.\nAW:
        Yeah, and for someone exploring around the Minnesota wilderness and landscape,
        to be able to go out to the western states to see the mountains for the first
        time\u2014it\u2019s just really incredible. Do you remember any stories from
        that time, any first impressions of seeing some of that natural environment?\nRV:
        Nothing that I want to share (laughs).\nAW: Okay\u2014\nRV: I don\u2019t know,
        I mean I don\u2019t know how detailed you want to get?\nAW: Well, I was just
        curious cause it seems like you\u2019re really inspired by nature and by plant
        designs and things like that, so\u2014\nRV: Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say I necessarily
        grabbed a hold of my artistic designs from my travels, so much, necessarily.
        I think that evolved more as I spent a lot of time with gardening, once I
        got more settled. I got into the gardening thing. I remember a certain period
        in my life I just really needed a breather. Focused on my work to express
        myself\u2014and really, I actually asked God, Give me some type of growth
        in my work. I was kind of in this\u2014I don\u2019t know what you call it,
        just a cycle of repeating what I\u2019d been doing, so-to-speak. And then
        I grabbed hold of the botanical theme really big time and I was really inspired
        by Janel Jacobson\u2019s work. Do you know her work at all?\n00:06:06\nShe\u2019s
        actually Will Swanson\u2019s wife and at the time she was carving porcelain.
        And I was really impressed with her work, she\u2019s an incredible artist.
        So I decided to start carving, and that really helped me express more of a
        botanical theme in my work, more in-depth-wise\u2014\nAW: Your first interest
        in art?\nRV: Yeah, well, I like to say I got my start in pottery when I was
        about six or something, hanging out with my friends in the backyard. It was
        a really, really muddy summer and I happened to find this place where we could
        make bowls out of the mud. And, of course, that\u2019s just a little anecdote
        but I really got the bug or hooked on pottery in high school, in my sophomore
        year.\nAW: And you went to which high school?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n4\nRV: That was in White Bear Lake. D.
        Krech was the teacher at the time. We had modular scheduling and it was the
        big thing then, and so we had a lot of liberality in our time. And I would
        live in the pottery studio. He\u2019d allow us, even while there were other
        classes going on, and I just spent a lot of time there. Through my time there
        and three years of high school I decided at that time that I would like to
        have a studio eventually. And that was one thing that I could express myself
        and I was doing well with it. So, I thought, Well, maybe that\u2019s a direction
        I should go to. And then after those couple years that I mentioned traveling,
        then I returned to school at Lakewood Community College, it\u2019s now Century.
        Spent some time with the attendant ceramic teacher there, Mackleberg, during
        the summer, but then the following year, they brought in\u2014she was a student
        of Warren MacKenzie, Susan Eggerman. They also brought in a studio assistant.
        So the studio was open ten hours a day and I just ate it up. I decided I\u2019m
        going to really focus on my potting and after that years\u2019 time or so
        I wanted to start my business and that\u2019s what I did.\nAW: When you were
        in high school and you realized you had a real interest in pottery, did you
        have any role models or people who made this a life career?\nRV: Right, no,
        the teacher, he had a business, or he was starting a business\u2014\nAW: And
        his name again was?\nRV: That was D. Krech. I think it was David Krech. I
        think he was kind of D. Krech\u2014\nAW: Oh, okay. How do you spell his last
        name?\nRV: I think it was K-r-e-c-h. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still
        around, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the teacher anymore, but\u2014\nAW: Did
        you interact with him much?\nRV: Not particularly, his teacher would do some
        demonstrations and [unclear] would do some work and, it was kind of surface\u2014\nAW:
        And then at community college you said that your professor there was Professor
        Mackleberg?\nRV: Yeah\u2014well, he was the one that I did some summer classes
        with, but then after that it was Susan Eggerman. She was a student of Warren
        MacKenzie\u2019s and she worked with porcelain, and that\u2019s where I got
        introduced with porcelain. I know she recognized in me, she says, \u201cWell,
        Richard, you got a bent.\u201d Yeah, I mean I was a student who just wanted
        to stay there all day long. One day talked to me, \u201cRichard, you know
        we\u2019ve got other classes and students coming in. So, you\u2019re going
        to have to give up a wheel.\u201d And I was heartbroken, and I didn\u2019t
        do it (laughs). I just stayed in class and she never kicked me out.\n00:10:38\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n5\nAW: What do
        you think drew you to do that all day?\nRV: Well, at that time I had a passion
        to get involved with pots as an income. I really wanted to focus and after
        spending that time, like I said, for a few years after high school traveling,
        starting a family already, and got married, and I just thought I have to get
        some steady income going here. And so I really wanted to focus, really focus,
        and see how far I could go with the opportunity I was given there. I mean
        with the studio open in the evenings too, it was just a great opportunity
        to just continue to make pots.\nAW: And how would you describe your work then?\nRV:
        I certainly had influence of the classical designs of China and such. I know
        I made one set of jars called Yin & Yang [brief pronunciation debate with
        \u201cyang\u201d]. It\u2019s interesting how that happened, and it\u2019s
        about all I can say about it. You know, it was just exploratory student work.\nAW:
        And you said you were interested in finding a way for that to be your main
        income. So, were you doing shows then? When was your first show?\nRV: Well,
        my first show was at the end of my last year, that intensive year. I had a
        student show at my in-laws house and showed my work from college, and people
        showed up and I was really encouraged. And so after that, then I started doing
        the shows around town.\nAW: So that must have felt great to have\u2014after
        this intensive year\u2014to have a good show like that and see the support
        for your work. Do you remember anything from putting that show together? You
        said your in-law\u2019s house, is that it?\nRV: It was at my in-laws\u2019
        house, yes. I don\u2019t know what to say\u2014it was just great to have people
        come to look at my work, purchase it, felt really good.\nAW: How did you get
        the word out to people?\nRV: I can\u2019t even remember at this point. It
        was word of mouth, probably did a mailing\u2014a postcard mailing, I\u2019m
        really not sure. It was too long ago (laughs).\nAW: So this would\u2019ve
        been in the early\/mid-seventies?\nRV: Yeah, it would\u2019ve been the late
        seventies. In seventy-nine. I started my business\u2014so it would have been
        \u2019seventy-eight probably when I did that show.\nAW: So did you earn a
        degree from Lakewood?\nRV: No, I didn\u2019t, and I know I was pretty much
        doing\u2014just really going there to spend time in the ceramics studio. I
        did some other classes, an outside interest in music\u2014I studied piano.
        But I wasn\u2019t really degree focused, and like I said I had a young family
        that needed me, and I had one child. But when I was in school I was just more
        intent on trying to get my business going, make money. The professor, she
        recommended that I go on to college and I just thought of the time A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n6\nand money involved,
        and I didn\u2019t do it. I must admit I miss not studying business aspects
        or getting more tied into the higher level education and relationships in
        the university setting.\nAW: What did you think of working with Susan? How
        did her style or philosophy connect to Warren\u2019s?\n00:14:58\nRV: Right,
        her work wasn\u2019t really the Minnesota\u2014mini\u2014? [Mingei-sota style].
        It\u2019s mixing the Hamada work with the Minnesota influence. She was more
        of a classical porcelain worker. I don\u2019t know how much that intermixed
        with Warren\u2019s work. She did bring us to a workshop, brought him in for
        a workshop\u2014we went to his studio\u2014so, I must admit I don\u2019t have
        as much as connection to Warren MacKenzie as many of the other potters in
        this group.\nAW: Was that the first time you met Warren? What did you think
        about his or the Hamada approach to pottery? Did that work well with what
        you were doing? Or were you really doing something different?\nRV: I don\u2019t
        know, I think I was just kind of clueless (laughs). I was just a student working
        with clay, you know. I remember one other workshop, it was Taeko Tanaka. She
        came in and was doing the work, and just a funny anecdote\u2014I asked her
        how much she made a year with her work And she said, \u201cSix thousand bucks,
        and that was gross.\u201d And I know a number of us students said, \u201cWow,
        I\u2019d like to make six thousand bucks.\u201d (Laughs).\nAW: At that time
        was that a good yearly salary?\nRV: Yeah, to think you could work at something
        you love like that and make money too.\nAW: So after this first show you decided
        you would make a business of it? How did you do that? How did you start putting
        it all together?\nRV: Right, I purchased a potter\u2019s wheel. Had it dropped
        off at the house and it was in my kitchen (laughs), and I found a\u2014\nAW:
        And where were you living at this time?\nRV: It was a lake cabin on the north
        shore of White Bear Lake, just a small home. And then I looked\u2014I must\u2019ve
        found my kiln on a notice at Minnesota Clay Company perhaps, probably on the
        board there. I don\u2019t know how I got wind of that, but it was a Minnesota
        flat-top that\u2014Nils Lou was kind of leaving town and him and his buddy
        had this kiln. And here was this huge kiln that I was able to purchase for
        fifteen hundred bucks. My landlord noticed that I had this potter\u2019s wheel
        in the kitchen. He says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d And I told
        him and he says \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got this garage right out here, you
        know, right now I\u2019m just using it for storage so if you want to make
        your studio in there go ahead.\u201d So, for a little bit of money I was able
        to rent the building next to the house and it wasn\u2019t far away, and started
        my first studio and started doing shows, and growing in my work. It was quite
        the struggle in the beginning. I didn\u2019t make much. A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n7\nAW: Tell me a little bit more about
        the struggles? About making enough to get out there, building an audience
        for your work\u2014?\nRV: Well, certainly, I mean just making work that people
        really want to purchase, and then learning how to price it, right venues for
        your work, just growing as a potter, where people appreciate your work. I
        mean that\u2019s, I think, the tough part, especially coming from where I
        was coming from. Yeah, pretty much just an independent study person, and I
        didn\u2019t do the apprenticeship, or higher level training, so it was a lot
        of trial-and-error. But there was one year I actually worked up a pretty good
        income. And then I became a housefather. At the beginning I said I had one
        child, well (laughs), I mistakenly end up bringing forth four children. I
        mean it wasn\u2019t my plan, you know, I was thinking we\u2019d stop at two.
        But didn\u2019t make the attempts to make sure that happened so we had four
        children. And it was just to the point of we can\u2019t afford to take care
        [pay daycare]\u2014so, I became a housefather, with kind of mixing in sometime
        when I could work with my pots. I did that for quite a few years before Michelle
        finally got in school.\nAW: And your wife, what\u2019s her name?\nRV: It\u2019s
        Barbara. She ended up studying food technology and ended up at Pillsbury.
        So that was a really good financial help for a budding potter.\nAW: And where
        did she\u2014which location of Pillsbury did she work at? Did she work at
        their headquarters?\nRV: What do you call it? The St. Anthony Main, of course
        now they\u2019re General Mills.\nAW: And were you guys living in White Bear
        Lake this whole time?\nRV: Yeah, until\u2014well I can\u2019t remember what
        year, it\u2019s been about twenty-five, twenty-six years, when we moved here.
        As it turned out, my landlord, which lived right next door, came over one
        day and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to give you six months\u2019 notice,
        but I\u2019m going to be tearing down this house and building my dream home
        here.\u201d He had an older home next door and him and his wife wanted to
        build right there next to the lake. So we started looking for property within
        six months, maybe it was three, anything we could afford. We had to get out
        of town so that was how we found this place. When we saw it, it looked quite
        a bit different when we came here, but for the price, and close to a school
        district because we had these four kids still. We knew it was for us and we
        settled.\nAW: Here in North Branch\u2014So, you\u2019ve been here since what
        year?\nRV: Well, I don\u2019t keep those details well but at least twenty-six
        years.\nAW: Okay, so that must\u2019ve been quite a commute for Barbara\u2014\nRV:
        Yeah, and it still is, she still is\u2014\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n8\nAW: Oh, she\u2019s still working, okay\u2014\nRV:
        Yup\u2014\nAW: Wow\nRV: She still is, yep, she\u2019s struggled with that
        through the years.\nAW: Why did you decide to move here?\nRV: It was economically
        feasible and the house was an incredible price for the property here and it
        did have a building that I could make into a studio.\nAW: And you had space
        for your kiln?\nRV: Right.\nAW: What was it like in those early years when
        you were setting up your business? And even after you left high school and
        stuff, how did your parents think, what did they think you were up to?\nRV:
        (Laughs) Well, my mother would say\u2014her idea was that I should go to technical
        school, you know, learn a trade. And my father, I don\u2019t know, he wasn\u2019t
        one of these strong fathers that\u2019ll tell you what to do. It\u2019s pretty
        much you make it on your own and you find your way [in life] and do what you
        like. They came to my first show, maybe another one in the city park, but
        I didn\u2019t have a lot of strong support [from them] for me to pursue that.
        I did the Renaissance Fest for years, had an award winning building down there
        and such. They never even came down to see that one; they were sort of disengaged
        parents as far as my arts. They were older people\u2014yeah, I don\u2019t
        know, not highly educated, the arts certainly were not where they were at,
        per se.\n00:23:47\nAW: What did your parents do?\nRV: Well, yeah, they were
        just blue-collar people that really didn\u2019t\u2014they grew up in a different
        era. My father, in his later years, he was working as a foreman at Union Depot
        in the mail area, and I think all the years I was alive my mother was a housemother.\nAW:
        Were they from White Bear Lake originally?\nRV: My mother migrated from Germany
        between the two wars. And oddly enough, her family came out here to North
        Branch. And my father, he was a St. Paul-ite, I imagine, all his life.\nAW:
        So, his parents were in St. Paul as well?\nRV: I believe so, all their lives
        too. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n9\nAW:
        Your mother migrated from Germany\u2014how long was she here in North Branch?
        How did she meet your father? How did they meet up?\nRV: My mother\u2019s
        family eventually moved to St. Paul and that\u2019s where she met him. I\u2019m
        not sure how they met up, a friend of a friend or something.\nAW: Okay, now
        your siblings at this time, what were they up to? What were they doing?\nRV:
        At which point?\nAW: When you were first starting this business. I\u2019m
        just trying to get a sense of your early experiences and family.\nRV: Family
        sure\u2014my oldest sibling, my brother, he was a carpenter. At the point
        that I was starting my business we were kind of disengaged; we really didn\u2019t
        have a lot of interconnection there. And another sister was a housewife, and
        would spend a lot of time with her kids. So as I was growing up I was spending
        time with her kids, my niece and nephews and she was a housemother. Another
        sibling was a secretary. The youngest one, she was\u2014I grew up in the seventies
        and that highly affected my societal thinking. \u201cI\u2019m a child of the
        seventies,\u201d I say. And they talk about the sixties, but for me it was
        the seventies and the American revolution\u2014I got really caught up in that.
        And that was partly too, I mean I was a free will, artsy person. I don\u2019t
        know how to explain all that at this point, but\u2014. So, I imagined my younger
        sister, she was kind of thrilled that I was pursuing the arts. You know, she
        was in college at the time and pursuing arts though she never worked in that
        field.\nAW: And what are their names?\nRV: Well, the youngest is Lynn Vincent
        and then Tooty, which is Yvonne, she\u2019s passed away, and then the other
        one, my brother is Joseph, and my other sister is Deanne.\nAW: Okay, so you\u2019re
        saying \u201cchild of the seventies.\u201d So what did that mean to you?\nRV:
        Well, anti-war, counter-culture\u2014definitely a counter-culture person.
        I suppose I was like a hippie wannabe (laughs).\nAW: And what year did you
        graduate [high school] then?\nRV: That was \u201973.\nAW: What did it mean
        to you to be counter-culture? Was it the music you were listening to? The
        lifestyle?\nRV: Well, even in high school when it came down to it, I did not
        graduate. I had my focus, I was interested in the arts and that\u2019s what
        I wanted to do. Thinking back about it, it would\u2019ve been great if there
        had been like a program that they have now where they have these arts schools.
        If I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n10\ncould\u2019ve
        gotten in a program in high school where, \u201cOkay Richard, this is what
        your interest is, we\u2019ll help you pursue that.\u201d Essentially I decided,
        Well, I\u2019m going to do this [pottery] and I don\u2019t have any interest\u2014I
        mean the diploma, that was like a counter-culture choice. I don\u2019t need
        a diploma to be a potter. Why? It was like you were going to say no to the
        status quo, so-to-speak, that\u2019s counter-culture. Certainly going off
        traveling for months on end, I mean, my mother thought it was being a bum.
        I just considered it discovering the world and enjoying nature and the beauty
        of nature. I had read an article in the paper of some guy, I don\u2019t know
        if he was out of high school, but he traveled with his guitar. And I thought,
        Wow, I\u2019d like to do that (laughs), and it\u2019s essentially what I did\u2014travel
        with my guitar.\nAW: So you play music as well?\nRV: Yeah, I do play some
        music.\nAW: Guitar, and you said piano?\nRV: Well, I studied piano, but I
        did not really fulfill that one (laughs). And I\u2019m kind of a half-assed
        guitarist. But I really enjoy singing and playing. So, it\u2019s an important
        part of my life.\nAW: What do you play or sing?\n00:30:15\nRV: At this point
        I suppose it\u2019s hard to describe. I suppose it\u2019s kind of a folk\/country
        type, though I like a jazz influence, and voice. For years I did get hooked
        up into Christian faith and it eventually evolved into worship leading. So
        I was doing that for years, but since last year I\u2019m not any longer a
        worship leader, so\u2014and I must admit I rarely play Christian music anymore
        (laughs), it\u2019s kind of odd. That\u2019s a whole other story which I don\u2019t
        want to get into.\nAW: Oh, okay. Can I ask how faith was important to you
        in terms of your art?\nRV: Not so my art, I wouldn\u2019t say\u2014I\u2014you
        can thank God for your gift. Certainly I\u2019ve had experiences. If you want
        to get some experiences with my faith and my art, sure I\u2019ll share that.
        Okay, so, like I said I ask the Lord at a certain period of life, my career,
        to give me new designs, that\u2019s what it was. And I believe that\u2019s
        when I started the carving and getting more in depth with the botanical theme
        on my work. One specific day I was thinking, How can I make a bowl in the
        shape of a leaf? And immediately I see this vase form. You know how you have
        a mind\u2019s eye and imagination flows? Immediately I see this vase form
        and then seeing it cut in half, and then laid on edge, on its side. And then
        I see\u2014I\u2019m seeing it\u2014how it can get formed into the leaf. So,
        in some respects that\u2019s really how my faith is integrated. I\u2019ve
        been baptized in the Holy Spirit, I think my spirit has grown and so receive
        input from a higher source, you could say. When I asked the Lord how to make
        a bowl, and I just see that, it was like an immediate answer. So for that
        question, I suppose that is a good integration.\nAW: So is the source of inspiration\u2014was
        it also something that kind of sustained you through the years? A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n11\nRV: Well, certainly,
        you know, you pray about the weather (laughs)\u2014\nAW: Particularly with
        the Tour. It seems like you never quite know\u2014people talking about snow,
        people talking about rain during the Tour (laughs)\u2014\nTM: God has a sense
        of humor.\nAW: Right (laughter).\nRV: I suppose at times wisdom, or just needing
        strength and power to continue, and drawing from the relationship that way.\nAW:
        Can I ask if you grew up in a religious household? Did you attend church at
        all?\nRV: No, I did not. Interestingly enough, my parents\u2014they really
        didn\u2019t have a faith at that point. But what had happened was when my
        parents were married my father\u2019s family was very Catholic so they had
        to agree with his parents\u2019 wishes for the children to be put into Catholic
        school. So, my older siblings grew up in the Catholic schools. One of my sisters,
        who was still living at the house when I was younger, she would attend the
        Catholic Church, so I attended with her, so I had some experience in the church
        or with friends, but I didn\u2019t grab a hold of that and\u2014Do you want
        to hear about my faith?\n00:34:40\nAW: Yeah, if you feel comfortable sharing.
        It feels like this is an important part of your life.\nRV: That\u2019s fine
        if you want to peer into my life history. It\u2019s not so much arts related\u2014but
        anyways\u2014I was coming out of a music venue, I was about sixteen years
        old and I met this young man\u2014you know how you greet somebody leaving?
        And he told me, oddly enough, he met God. And I thought, Well, yeah, I\u2019d
        like to meet God, but I didn\u2019t have time to talk, so that was it, but
        it instilled the desire for me to meet God.\nHere, I\u2019m hanging out with
        my girlfriend\u2014which is my wife at this time\u2014one night. It was a
        winter night, in my eleventh year of high school, and I sense His presence
        above me and then hear this voice. I mean I believe that our spirits can hear
        from God, and so I believe God was speaking to my spiritual ear. He says,
        \u201cI\u2019m God, I love you, and I have a plan for your life.\u201d I\u2019m
        thinking, Whoa, what\u2019s going on here? and just happened that we had a
        meeting planned with some of our friends.\nIt was a cold winter\u2019s night
        and we didn\u2019t have a car, but we walked into town and they weren\u2019t
        there yet, the place was locked up. Two blocks down was my girlfriend\u2019s
        church, which was the same church I\u2019d attended in the past, the Catholic
        church. So we decided the go in there, to keep warm until they showed up.
        Walked in the doors and I hear the voice again, it says, \u201cYou\u2019ll
        be like a Billy Graham.\u201d And I thought, No way, because I was very shy
        at the time and I must\u2019ve known that Billy Graham talked to a lot of
        people, though I did not know what he talked about. I A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n12\ndidn\u2019t understand the concepts
        of the Gospel. So, I just thought to myself, No way, but in my mind\u2019s
        eye I saw all these people\u2019s faces. It was a very different thing happening.
        And then one of my friends was there, he was practicing\u2014Saint Mary\u2019s
        of the Lake had this huge pipe organ\u2014and he was practicing the pipe organ,
        playing some fugues or something. And we decided to walk up to the altar.
        And there they had the statue of Jesus Christ on the cross. And immediately
        when I looked upon the statue of Christ on the cross\u2014you know the Bible
        talks about revelation\u2014the Holy Spirit gave me this, it was like a download
        of revelation, of faith, just like that (finger snaps). Jesus had paid the
        price for my sin. I believed it, I received this gift of faith, it was like
        I was flooded with light. And you know how I had mentioned that I had wanted
        to meet God? I knew at that moment that I had met God. It was like I was seeing
        all my life before. Coming to terms with Christ on the cross for myself, as
        like, living in this darkness, and that moment was like light, and understanding
        came into my life. And I know now that at that moment I was born again, like
        what the Bible talks about, being born again. I didn\u2019t understand those
        concepts really, though I was living in it, and I was repentant, I was sorry
        for my sin, I remember weeping.\nAnd then about two hours later when we were
        hanging out with our friends, in that meeting place, I had this experience
        with my girlfriend. She was hanging out across the room\u2014this weird butterfly
        thing [happened in my belly]\u2014and then I heard the voice again says, \u201cTalk
        to her parents about marrying her.\u201d (Laughs) I\u2019m in eleventh grade
        and I\u2019m thinking, Hmm. But it really was a confirmation, because we already
        had a love relationship and we talked about living together and having a family.
        Anyways, so you asked about faith, and that\u2019s my testimony on start of
        my life with God. And I really never did become a Billy Graham in the stadium
        setting\u2014\nTM: Did you ever witness him speak?\nRV: I did. That\u2019s
        right when he came to the cities years ago. Brought the kids, the family,
        some friends\u2014went there and that was good. Though I must admit, you know,
        through my years of faith I got involved with a mission in India. And one
        of the high points of that mission, like the fifth time I went, we were part
        of a start-up mission of\u2014indigenous missionaries were asking for help
        from people in the states. So the beginning of it was just going through the
        communities praying with these people. Just seeing what God might show or
        say\u2014interceding. I don\u2019t know if you know the concepts of intercession,
        where you cry to God for the people of the community that He would come and
        bring His life and truth to them. And most of these communities were Hindu,
        and of course being Christian you don\u2019t think of the Hindu faith as the
        faith to hang out with, so-to-speak. And so from there, after the fifth trip\u2014I
        mean it started just in prayer and intercession, and now this ministry had
        grown to sixty church planners, I don\u2019t know how many churches. It\u2019s
        phenomenal in how much it has grown\u2014But one of the high points you mentioned,
        Billy Graham is\u2014one of the women in one of these communities who was
        part of one of these house churches, she invited all her friends to come and
        visit with the Americans, who were coming to visit. And of course, we were
        there at that time to meet with people and all to share the Gospel, if given
        the opportunity. And that night I was able to share the Gospel with the people
        in that house and many raised their hand and received Jesus Christ as their
        savior. But, the woman who invited us, she had actually been born again at
        a Billy Graham concert in New Delhi many years before that, when she\u2019d
        received Jesus Christ as her savior. I imagine, I think she had grown up Hindu.
        It was just a high point on that one. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n13\n00:41:08\nAW: And kind of a small world connection
        as Billy Graham moved through, that you were going places and meeting people
        who had also had similar appreciation for Billy Graham.\nAW: So it sounds
        like you had this amazing experience\u2014I was curious that you just seemed
        to know that pottery was what you were going to do.\nRV: Right, like I said,
        I got hooked in high school and I was good at it. I mean I made a casserole
        and (laughs) and that type of thing, and I just thought, Well, this is something
        I\u2019d like to pursue. The teacher, he was opening up a studio, like a production
        studio\/gallery type of thing in Mahtomedi at the time. He invited me to come
        and be a worker for him, if I had interest. But I didn\u2019t take him up
        on it, I just resisted that one. I was too independent I guess (laughs).\nAW:
        Do you feel like you were able to kind of rely on faith while you were starting
        this business on your own?\nRV: Well, all I can imagine is\u2014yeah, there\u2019s
        always an asking, a direction, the inspiration, like I said. The Holy Spirit
        is a creative spirit, he can lead you, direct you, give you blessings.\nAW:
        So, since that time then you became really actively involved in church?\nRV:
        I was, very much so.\nAW: What church did you go to? When you were traveling
        did you stop by many churches?\nRV: Oh, you mean in my travel years?\nAW:
        Yeah.\nRV: Not so much. I wasn\u2019t really that strongly connected to the
        church at that point. I had personal faith, but I really didn\u2019t connect
        it strongly to, you know, church per se until after I was well advanced in
        my years and we had a family. I\u2019d experienced what\u2019s called a \u201ccharismatic
        renewal\u201d of the \u2018seventies. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever
        heard of that? That\u2019d be interesting for your history. I don\u2019t know
        if it came out of the Catholic Church. And that was also when I got baptized
        in the Holy Spirit. And so that was a strong, you know, connection time of
        just experiencing God on a very personal level, really powerfully. But then
        I just kind of\u2014when I was traveling I just kind of got away from that,
        I really wasn\u2019t a church attender much.\nFrom here I went to what\u2019s
        called River of Life Church in Cambridge, this charismatic church. And was
        kind of longing for that joy I\u2019d experienced in my early years with God.
        And right away that day, I just sensed the Holy Spirit there, and the flow
        of life, of God, and so I got very well connected. And then there\u2019s another
        one you might want to check into if you\u2019re interested in historical aspects
        of Christian faith. There was an outpouring in \u201994, the Toronto Airport
        Church they called it, something like that. Airport Christian Fellowship is
        what it\u2019s called now. They A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n14\ncalled it the Toronto Blessing. I was highly affected
        by the flow of God during that time of my life too, and I think that was life
        changing and really got me much more structured into church life. I became
        part of the worship team and such and started expressing myself musically
        in a Christian way, at that point, and then being involved with missions.\n00:45:05\nAW:
        So could you describe what the outpouring is? I\u2019m not as familiar with
        it.\nRV: Okay, well I\u2019ll talk about the latest one, in \u201894. They
        called it the Toronto Blessing, in the beginning. The church itself calls
        it, The Father\u2019s Blessing, essentially is, God for some reason, chooses
        times in periods of society to pour out His spirit. It\u2019s like God starts
        making Himself be seen and experienced in very strong, revelatory ways. I
        don\u2019t know how to explain it. If you go to a meeting where the spirit
        is being poured out, you can just sense this flow of life, and it\u2019s spiritual
        life. And if you have any kind of relationship with God, I mean, you understand,
        it\u2019s Him. There\u2019s deliverance from soul issues, there can be healing
        deliverances, and there can be some odd manifestations. If you have ever heard
        of the laughter thing, people get carried away in laughter. I know my wife
        experienced that once at one of these meetings while in Toronto folks came
        to the cities, and we\u2019re doing meetings, and it became this healing thing
        for her. And laughter, it just builds up. It\u2019s coming from the spirit,
        you can\u2019t control it, and your body is just healed\u2014the soul. And
        really it\u2019s God impacting the world. And you can continue to connect
        with Him. You can do it in your own personal time, so-to-speak. He inspires
        you to work in the world\u2014I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s all I can say
        about it at this point that I can think of.\nAW: How long were the Toronto
        folks here? And where were they from? What church? What organization?\nRV:
        Toronto Airport Church. It\u2019s a historical thing. I think somebody came
        and was doing some meetings. And it\u2019s like, for some reason, God used
        him, I think it was Randy\u2014I can\u2019t remember his name. And that wasn\u2019t
        the only place where this outpouring happened, but it\u2019s like it came\u2014the
        expressions of God\u2019s spirit there was so strong that people came from
        all over the world to experience it. And I can\u2019t remember how many years\u2014I
        did spend some time at that church, in like a ministry class years later,
        but the outpouring weren\u2019t so strong then. I mean, God shows up and,
        I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I\u2019ve seen it happen, but I don\u2019t
        know how to explain it. I don\u2019t know how many years that church was so
        strongly active.\nAW: But for several years it went on?\nRV: Yeah, definitely.
        I\u2019m not sure how long. And there was other ones, just one, in Argentina.
        Of course the charismatic renewal\u2014and in the early sixties, or the late
        sixties\/seventies\u2014\nAW: That\u2019s when the charismatic renewal emerged?\nRV:
        I think it was the late sixties, I don\u2019t even know the history on that
        one so much, but\u2014\nAW: So in the mid-nineties\u2014you said \u201994\u2014so
        is that charismatic renewal was still happening? A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n15\nRV: Well, that was like a new expression
        of it. I think, yeah, that was like a new outpouring. And I went to this ministry
        school and they said about every twenty years it\u2019s like God pours out
        his spirit in a mighty way. And so there was the charismatic renewal of the
        sixties, I\u2019m not even sure when that started. I got in the tail end of
        it in the early seventies. And then about twenty years later there was this
        Toronto thing and that went all around the world. Yeah, it\u2019s interesting.
        I mean when the Holy Spirit shows up so strong some people can deal with it.
        Other people go, it must be some demonic thing, you know, the enemy (laughs),
        Satan\u2019s doing a thing here with these people, let\u2019s get outta here.
        I mean that\u2019s how intense what\u2019s going is happening. Of course there
        are some churches who don\u2019t even believe in spiritual healing these days,
        you know. Essentially to me it\u2019s the fulfillment of, like, in \u201cActs.\u201d
        Have you ever read \u201cActs\u201d and how the different miracles would happen
        and stuff\u2014outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the rapture of the Holy Spirit,
        speaking in tongues and stuff\u2014healings, my wife, she has a strong prophetic
        gifting. So then, she\u2019ll hear things either from God for a congregation
        or for small groups\/individuals. We still do some jail ministry. And God
        will speak directly to some of these guys through her and it\u2019s quite
        interesting.\n00:51:05\nAW: So was that a time when you started becoming more
        involved in the church and you played music?\nRV: Right, it was about twelve
        years at a local church up in Rush City; I was a worship leader, co-worship
        leader with my wife. And after she left, got brought out into heading up the
        prophetic ministry. Then I was the worship leader.\nAW: What church is that?\nRV:
        That was Living Water Fellowship.\nAW: what did it mean to be a worship leader?\nRV:
        Well, worship leader is essentially leading the congregation, leading the
        worship team, preparing the songs, leading the congregation with the worship
        team into praise and honor of the Lord through songs. And ultimately the idea
        is that you welcome God in and people start getting back to Him. To honor
        Him, glorify Him through songs, speak about our life with Him, His life towards
        us and such. And so, well, at the last church we were at we would, you know,
        have half an hour to forty-five minutes of praise and worship. It\u2019s a
        charismatic church, so we gave opportunity for the prophetic gifts to come
        out. My wife would often get prophetic word to share with the congregation,
        or some of the others who were so gifted. And, always want more of healing
        and there wasn\u2019t a lot of healing, per se, manifest, as compared to the
        prophetic word that was trying to inspire people to draw closer to God or
        be free from their issues and such.\nAW: And who was part of the congregation?
        A whole variety of people? People from mainly this area? Do you get people
        coming from Wisconsin and Minnesota?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n16\nRV: Yeah, it was a smaller church in Rush City so
        it wasn\u2019t huge. You know, it was kind of like a lot of surprise, some
        people would be coming from St. Paul to participate, or you know, quite a
        distance. But it\u2019s just because they didn\u2019t know anything else,
        they appreciated what was going on there at the time. But it\u2019s more like
        a small, regional church. People would travel a good half an hour to go there
        at times. At this point I might add that we are no longer part of that church
        actually.\nAW: Well, thank you for sharing about that because it seems such
        an important part of your life.\nRV: Well, you\u2019re welcome.\nAW: This
        is about the history of the Tour, but really it\u2019s about individuals and
        their life histories.\nRV: So, you\u2019re really wanting to pursue life history
        too?\nAW: I think that it is an important part to understanding you, not just
        you and pottery. But we should return to\u2014\nRV: Sure\u2014to the Tour?\nAW:
        To the Tour. So you\u2019re getting your business started, and this is in
        the early eighties. You moved to North Branch\u2014what was that like when
        you moved into this area? In terms of pottery? Actually, before that, go over
        the kind of work that you do.\nRV: Yeah, botanical themes\u2014\nAW: Anything
        else to say about the kind of work that you were doing then?\nRV: No it was
        the early years, it was very much exploratory, just functional work. And then,
        like I said, I kind of transitioned. I was doing the Renaissance [Ren] Fest
        for twelve years. And then I think it was the last year I started transitioning
        into this carved work, which is very labor intensive. I couldn\u2019t keep
        up doing carved work and the show. And it certainly, it\u2019s not a great
        venue for that, you know. So, I just quit the Ren Fest, then after that year
        end\u2014\n00:55:50\nAW: So, that was the kind of stuff you were making?\nRV:
        Yeah, carved pieces and essentially it\u2019s throwing the piece on the wheel
        and then when it\u2019s leather hard you start incising and carving the forms.
        And I started doing that, so it was just too hard to produce work for Ren
        Fest. It\u2019s not the venue, you know. Imagine people running around the
        Ren Fest with something so fragile. It\u2019s not really what they\u2019re
        looking for. And so, I started doing more shows like the American Crafts Council
        show. That was very rewarding.\nAW: When did you start with them?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n17\nRV: I\u2019d have
        to look at my resume. I don\u2019t know if it was the second or third year
        they came to the cities? They were in Minneapolis at that point, I know that.
        I think they started in St. Paul, and then they moved to Minneapolis. And
        that\u2019s when I got involved with them, must have been early nineties.
        And I did a few other places with the American Crafts Council, but never really
        been much for traveling with my work long distance. I\u2019ve done some, but
        it\u2019s never really panned out economically well. But I did those through
        the years, American Crafts Council and other quality shows like Uptown, and
        transition to Powderhorn, and\u2014I\u2019ve actually stopped doing the summer
        shows.\nAW: Why is that?\nRV: Just a struggle to deal with the heat, the personal
        work discipline too, I think, is some of the issue. But I had been doing Uptown
        and then I got juried out one year. Transitioned to Powderhorn Park and that
        was actually a real nice venue, it was very pleasant. Did well there, but
        I don\u2019t know, something happened, I don\u2019t know if I was dealing
        with depression or what. It was just hard for me to build up my work. I\u2019d
        be canceling for that show and so I just stopped doing summer shows. I hate
        the heat. Just remember it being in Uptown you know, and one year it was like
        ninety-five degrees, ninety-five percent humidity, I was like, I can\u2019t
        handle this.\nAW: And the crowds of people, you\u2019re just there on the
        street.\nRV: Yeah, and I was in a position where\u2014last year\u2014it created
        a problem for me. We had to set up your stuff on the sidewalk and then at
        ten o\u2019clock you moved it in the street, or nine o\u2019clock, you know,
        cause they had the buses going early. I was on Lake Street. And that one year
        my daughter, she couldn\u2019t\u2014she got an infection, and she was my helper
        and I didn\u2019t get the set-up. I think that put me on the outs with them.\nAW:
        So those were in Minneapolis. Did you do St. Paul art shows?\nRV: Mears Park.
        Did the American Crafts Council show then, when they moved to St. Paul for
        years. And of course, when the Tour started coming around\u2014I mean I did
        both of them for years, the American Crafts Council and the Tour, but they\u2019re
        a month apart, and it just got to be too much, trying to be ready for both
        of them. And a number of the other hosts had dropped out of the American Crafts
        Council show, just because they knew they could sell their work at the Tour
        and not pay so much, put so much time into a show, just a month before. So,
        I finally dropped out, but you know, it was a good show while I was there,
        but it\u2019s been a lot more pleasant not to have to deal with a show in
        April when you got the Tour coming up in May.\nAW: Let\u2019s get to the Tour.
        So when you first came to North Branch did you know any of the potters here?
        Did you know what the pottery community was like here?\nRV: I had met Linda
        somehow. I did not know the local potters. And I think I met Will and Janel
        at the Ren Fest. She was there and then she got married and so I met Will
        there. But they dropped out, almost a year before, or soon after I did.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n18\nI was not
        terribly involved with the, you know, the ceramics community of the Twin Cities,
        besides meeting the people at the shows. Other than that I was pretty much
        a potter on my own.\n01:00:38\nAW: You said you met Will and Janel at Ren
        Fest and then met Linda at some point. So, when you got here and they started,
        were there some discussions around the Tour. How did the Tour start?\nRV:
        Right\u2014Bob called me one day. I don\u2019t even think I knew him. And
        he just said, \u201cRichard, we got this tour of studios and we want to know
        if you\u2019d like to participate.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d And
        they didn\u2019t invite me to a planning meeting, I didn\u2019t even know
        if they had a planning meeting. So I didn\u2019t know that much about it but
        I did the show. And I knew so little about it I didn\u2019t even know if it
        was a continuing yearly thing. I actually signed up for a different show at
        Macalester College for that spring, which happened to be the same weekend
        as that tour. And I know I ended up telling Bob, \u201cWell, I signed up for
        this show, you know.\u201d (laughs). The communications weren\u2019t that
        good towards me in the beginning. You know, I really wasn\u2019t in the early
        start up group. I think they realized, well, we got to get you involved with
        planning and all that, so you know more of what\u2019s happening. So, in the
        third year I started attending planning meetings and such.\nAW: What did you
        think? Why did you get involved?\nRV: They invited me to and it was certainly
        an opportunity to do a show with fellow potters and the Tour, I mean the idea
        of doing a show. I think I\u2019d done shows here in the past, they weren\u2019t
        terribly successful. Certainly with a group that was bringing more people
        in, had more of a customer base. It was just an opportunity that showed up
        and I thought I should take advantage of it. And it\u2019s been good, certainly.
        The people that show up for this show, it\u2019s amazing.\nAW: Yeah, tell
        us about some of the people who show up? Over the years, are there regular
        customers? People who show up year after year?\nRV: Yeah, many do.\nAW: What
        was your customer base like when you started the Tour?\nRV: Well, I had been
        doing the Minnesota Crafts Council shows so I had a mailing list. I had people
        that would come to my shows, you know, buy from me, certainly reoccurring
        customers. Customers here, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Just some
        of the people you see in the shows in the cities would show up and\u2014\nAW:
        Were they potters themselves?\nRV: I think they, well, some were potters or
        students. I think a lot of them were more just collectors, people who really
        appreciate pots. I mean, I\u2019m amazed at the collector mentality that,
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n19\nthey just
        have a soul passion to get more pots or to tea pots. And, my family didn\u2019t
        have that. I still invite my family and they don\u2019t show up, I mean it\u2019s
        amazing, you know.\nAW: Are you talking about your siblings here?\nRV: Yep,
        siblings, nieces, nephews, they rarely show up. They have in the past, but
        they just don\u2019t have that mentality of\u2014some people love pots.\nAW:
        What about your kids? Did any of them take up pottery?\nRV: The kids\u2014I
        invited them in the studio, we made some pots, but they really don\u2019t
        have that passion. Right now my son will often help with sales or set-up stuff.
        A daughter and grand-daughters now are starting to help with kitchen work
        or sales help. So, it\u2019s very much a family operation. And then some people
        we know from church, they come in and help with the wife with baking.\nAW:
        What about your wife, Barbara, did she ever take up pottery?\nRV: Not really,
        no. I think, when I decided to go to school, she said, \u201cWell I\u2019d
        like to do that too.\u201d But she decided to go into more technical studies,
        she was more science-oriented, and so that\u2019s what she did. And that\u2019s
        how she got into food technology.\n01:05:05\nAW: And when you were starting
        your business, was it mainly you? Or did she also play a role?\nRV: Well,
        she would help with sales and set-up. We\u2019d struggle with different viewpoints
        and after a while I just realized that I think it\u2019s just better if I
        (laughs) do my work on my own. I\u2019ll design my own display and you know,
        we get into too many issues like that, though it was helpful to have her there
        when I needed her. She was very involved with the Renaissance Festival. We
        did do a lot of that, we did as a family, you know the kids would dress up.
        And she enjoyed the time at Ren Fest, she used to\u2014do you know the FOPS
        at the Ren Fest?\nIt\u2019s a crazy story, well they used to come down because
        we had this nice Renaissance style building that was actually award winning.
        And they\u2019d come on down and play with us. The FOPS, they\u2019re like
        a pseudo-gay group. Some of them maybe are gay, obviously gay or\u2014they\u2019re
        just like a weird group of royal court comedians, you know.\nAnd so they get
        in to come down to visit her and they\u2019d be across the way and be flashing
        their mirrors and light into our place. And, \u201cYoo-hoo\u201d (laughs),
        and there\u2019d be this extravaganza of playing with them and like a theater
        setting. She made costumes for the kids and the kids would be out there doing
        their little thing, having fun with us. And right now she\u2014financial help
        being a potter, it\u2019s been phenomenal, you know. And it\u2019s been a
        struggle for her, because I don\u2019t make a huge income. My own personal
        discipline is not extremely strong, you know. I could say I was raised\u2014we
        were both raised at opposite ends of the spectrum. She was the first born
        of a farmer. So she essentially was the farmer\u2019s buddy, you know, to
        get things going there, and raising kids A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n20\nand all that too, with her mom\u2014and the cows,
        and all that. And I was the last born, essentially a suburban brat (laughs).\nAW:
        So you\u2019re saying that you guys came from very different\u2014\nRV: Backgrounds.\nAW:
        \u2014backgrounds. So when you were approaching the business\u2014?\nRV: Like
        I said, one year after I started my business I was going really strong\u2014had
        good sales, had quite a number of shows. And then I got kind of waylaid with
        all these kids, when I decided to be a housefather, and that kind of put a
        wrench in my business. I can relate to those women who go, \u201cOh I had
        a career and then I became a mother at the house, and now I have to get back
        into my own life.\u201d Even though I continued with pots I was mainly doing
        the Ren Fest, and build up work through the year and do the Ren Fest. I\u2019ve
        been doing some gallery shows, I mean, wholesaling besides that, but\u2014\nAW:
        What did that mean to you\u2014to be a housefather?\nRV: Well, I enjoyed it,
        I really enjoyed it. Of course, I could spend time with the kids in nature
        (laughs), continuing that lifestyle. I thought I was good at nurturing. So
        to me it was the most reasonable avenue to take. I\u2019d be the housefather
        and the wife was very \u201cType A\u201d strong, more intellectually motivated
        person\u2014she could take on the moneymaking (laughs).\nWe transitioned through
        those early years, that childhood, all those children.\nAW: So from when to
        when did you really kind of have to put your work on hold and focus on being
        a parent? When did you come back to work? When your youngest child was in
        school?\nRV: Well then I had my days totally free, yeah. I could definitely
        start focusing on my work stronger.\n01:10:05\nAW: So you were talking about
        the Tour and joining up. What were your first impressions when you started
        doing it?\nRV: Well my first impressions of the group. I thought, Wow, these
        people are strong, business-minded. They have great connections. Meeting and
        listening to who they know and this and that, the avenues they walked in,
        and it\u2019s just a great group.\nI know my professor, she said, \u201cIn
        the ceramics world it\u2019s who you know that really makes or breaks it in
        your life.\u201d And they were good people to know. Certainly, being part
        of this group is a great financial boost in the springtime. It\u2019s something\u2014we
        work just about all year long in a group, in some manner, like I\u2019m the
        treasurer for the last eight years, and so the in-depth seeing that part of
        it, so-to-speak, how the money comes in and goes out and such. A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n21\nAW: Can you tell us
        a little more about that? How have the finances behind the Tour worked?\nRV:
        Sure, well it started out as whatever expenses totaled and each person would
        report their income, and then the percentage of income in relation to total
        gross [sales was compared to expenses]. And that\u2019s what you would pay.
        Will Swanson was doing this, he was the treasurer at that point\u2014and so
        I sold, let\u2019s say I sold two-point-five percent of the total gross than
        I would pay two-point-five percent of the expenses. That\u2019s the way it
        was. So people who made huge bucks would have to pay the greater portion of
        the expenses. And it was going that way for quite some time. And some of the
        people who weren\u2019t making huge money\u2014and they were also volunteering,
        doing their time\u2014I\u2019m doing all this work here, but then I\u2019ve
        got to pay this. And I actually spoke up, and I was the one who proposed let\u2019s
        just everybody pay the same rate. I wasn\u2019t treasurer at that point. So
        we decided then to switch to three hundred dollars down and then [after the
        show charge] whatever amount was needed from each potter [to meet expenses
        and our charity goal]. Of course by then we had many guests already sharing
        the expenses. So then we pay the rest equally. I think that\u2019s a much
        better idea than doing all this finagling with numbers.\nAW: Wow, so only
        three hundred bucks down?\nRV: Well, like I say, it\u2019s three hundred bucks
        down in the fall or summertime. This past year was two hundred and seventy-five
        [dollars] to pay the remainder [after the show]. And then of course, the people
        who travel, they have to do the traveling expenses. And then we put up tents
        here, for just about everybody, so then you have to pay your two hundred [dollars]
        for the tent and then we share the food expenses and that was close to two
        hundred bucks this year [also] per potter. But that\u2019s all individual
        [between the studios], how they figure that out, what each potter is paying
        to share the expenses of the studio\u2014admission and food and such.\nAW:
        You\u2019re talking about the guest potters with their host?\nRV: Yeah, they
        work that one out, but it\u2019s not an extreme amount. But, you know five
        hundred and seventy-five [dollars] for the base pay\u2014for how good the
        show is really. The rest of us, you know, we\u2019re doing work too, along
        the way\u2014\nAW: What kinds of work do you do during the year to prep for
        the Tour?\nRV: We\u2019ll have a business meeting\u2014it\u2019s actually
        tomorrow\u2014and we may have another business meeting. Sometimes it\u2019s
        only twice a year, but then there\u2019s communications along the way. I,
        myself, am the treasurer. Will Swanson has been putting together, with the
        help of his wife and a commercial artist, the flyer. I imagine you\u2019ve
        seen the flyer? Yeah, and that\u2019s quite a job. And there\u2019s a promotional
        committee, I think Will, [Bob], and Guillermo work on that together, discussing
        where else we may put promotional funds. And then we also have a charity.
        Have you heard about the charity?\n01:15:35\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n22\nAW: Yeah, tell me more.\nRV: That\u2019s all part
        of this, well five hundred and seventy-five [dollars] each total for the show,
        where we collect six thousand dollars from all the potters. We have a charity
        fund and then we either choose to distribute it during the year or it builds
        up. At this point this year we\u2019ve given five hundred dollars to CERF,
        Craft Emergency Relief Fund. And we\u2019ve committed for\u2014is it five
        years?\u2014three thousand dollars a year to the Warren MacKenzie Scholarship.
        I think it\u2019s aiding Northern Clay Center administers, furthering education
        for ceramics students.\nAW: Is there a partnership between the Tour and the
        Northern Clay Center?\nRV: Well as far as them, they show our flyers. You
        know, we really haven\u2019t had a lot going with them besides\u2014I suppose
        having people hear about the show. I know Bob\u2014he uses some volunteers
        from Northern Clay Center for his work crew. I don\u2019t do that. So he [Bob]
        has a lot more relationship with\u2014I don\u2019t even show at Northern Clay
        Center these days.\nAW: When did they start having the guest potters?\nRV:
        I don\u2019t even know which year it was. Will put together this history.
        [Shows printed document of all potters at Tour.] Jeff, he had [guests] very
        early on.\nAW: So there started to be some guests in the nineties?\nRV: Yep,
        there were a few guests. I had my first guest in \u201898, Scott Malcolm.\nAW:
        Why did you choose to invite him?\nRV: Well, I was showing at the American
        Crafts Council show and I really appreciated his work. He had detailed, carved
        porcelains. Loved his work, you know, he was a pleasant guy, so I decided
        to invite him. When the concept of guests was becoming more of a thing to
        do\u2014\nAW: How did you feel about inviting guest potters?\nRV: I thought
        it was interesting. At the time I was showing in my little studio out there,
        and continued to show in there with him, and that was difficult. He had a
        small display. But to have my display up in there, and then his small display,
        and people coming in, him talking, me talking, it just didn\u2019t work well.
        So I didn\u2019t do that again after that. And then I can\u2019t remember
        when at what point\u2014oh, right, that next year I was alone.\nEventually
        I decided to put up a tent. I heard people were renting these tents, a twenty-by-twenty
        tent; I decided to put the money into that. So I moved out and it was probably
        the year when Sandy Byers joined her husband. She did not show outdoors and
        so I decided to give them my studio and then I\u2019d be out in the tent space.
        That worked a lot better, just the flow of people who could get around my
        work. And I can\u2019t remember what year I quit the American Crafts Council
        show, but it was financially a great move.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n23\n01:20:25\nAW: To quit that show and then focus on
        the Tour?\nRV: Well, I meant to move out of my studio. To give people more
        space, because it would always be this log jam trying to come into that little
        studio, and people would be waiting. And you want people to be able to take
        the time to relax with your work and look at it. And so some of that was really
        guest motivated. I had these guests and I had to get out (laughs).\nAW: Right,
        so when you first started, how many people were coming to your studio?\nRV:
        When we first started? Oh, I can\u2019t even remember. There must be at least
        a thousand now or more. I don\u2019t know.\nAW: A thousand now or more?\nRV:
        Yeah\u2014it\u2019s hard for me to judge. Some of the people are out there
        with clickers and stuff and I don\u2019t do that. But it\u2019s been great.
        I was impressed this year, with the cold Friday weather there were throngs
        of people, so many people made it. And the collectors have really learned
        that you want to get the first pick at a show go the first day that it\u2019s
        open. People show up, they take their vacation day, or whatever, from work.
        They come prepared to buy (laughs). We\u2019ve had people come from Missouri,
        I think they purchased a boat up here, and the woman was saying, \u201cWell
        we\u2019re filling it up with pots.\u201d Yeah, well I don\u2019t know how
        much they actually had. Another couple, this was the year before\u2014maybe
        it was that year, both these stories were from the year before this past one\u2014they
        purchased a mobile RV up in Ontario. It broke down, coming down through North
        Dakota, and still, they had to get to the Tour. So they intended to come to
        the Tour with their mobile. They were actually going back to Georgia, I think
        it was, something crazy like that. And they actually rented a car to get to
        the Tour, while their mobile van was being worked on. I mean that\u2019s how
        motivated people are. They didn\u2019t let that stop them. And of course,
        these days people are flying in from around the nation. It\u2019s incredible.\nAW:
        Why do you think they\u2019re so motivated?\nRV: These people they just have
        this passion for\u2014the collectors\u2014they just have a passion for pots.
        They probably have more passion than I do (laughs). Of course, I\u2019m not
        that big of a collector. I\u2019d love to have more, if we had the space and
        the money. They just love the quality of living with pots, using pots, and\u2014\nAW:
        Are some individuals you can think of? Some examples of a few people who keep
        coming back?\nRV: Well these people I see often, spring or fall, it\u2019s
        called the Bindley\u2019s\u2014have you heard of the Bindley\u2019s collection?\nAW:
        Tell us more.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n24\nRV:
        This is a couple, I think from Madison. They are avid collectors who actually
        share their collection with museums. They came this year because they had
        seen Mary Roettger\u2019s work that she was showing. They had picked up one
        of her pieces at one of the Madison or Milwaukee shows, a smaller piece, and
        when they saw that she was showing they had to come. And they got one of her
        big pieces. Their story goes is that they got so many pots they had to build
        a new house (laughs). They were talking to me about the boxes of pots under
        their dining room table and such. It\u2019s like an addiction almost, but
        it\u2019s an addiction and joy, they so enjoy, obviously, they have the disposable
        money, they can continue to purchase. They did give me\u2014the wife, she
        gave me a magazine with a story about their collection. If you want to take
        that you can have it because I probably don\u2019t need it and you [may] want
        to read about them.\nAW: We can just borrow it for now and you can let us
        know if you want it back.\n01:25:00\nRV: It doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t
        have a story about me in it. Though she said\u2014they were giving it to those
        who are part of their collection. They did buy one of these ones [indicating
        a piece].\nSo, those are incredible collectors, the Bindley\u2019s. The other
        ones, they just show up and, \u201cOh, I want five of these,\u201d you know,
        the planters or something. Just people they come back and back. This one woman
        in\u2014she\u2019s in Wyoming now, I delivered a pot, I think it was last
        year, that I had asked her if I could keep for photography. And I knew she
        had had some of my work. She said, \u201cRichard, come and see the collection
        of your work I\u2019ve got.\u201d She\u2019s got this collection room, so
        many of my pieces in display cases. I must admit it was a lot of neat work
        that I\u2019d done through the years.\nAW: Wow, that\u2019s really incredible.\nRV:
        That was really fun to see a collector and their collection of my work. I
        mean she has way more than I do. I usually don\u2019t keep my work. I don\u2019t
        have a lot of display space, need the money, so I always pretty much sell
        it.\nAW: When you keep an item why have you kept those?\nRV: Well, this one
        got busted, so I can\u2019t be selling that. And recently I decided that I
        like my new cup. This is a new design, I\u2019m starting more\u2014\nAW: Yeah,
        it\u2019s a beautiful piece\u2014\nRV: \u2014just kind of geometric slip textures.
        So I\u2019ve kept this cup\u2014I\u2019ll get a bowl\u2014\nAW: Okay\u2014yeah,
        it\u2019s really just beautiful\u2014the geometric design here on this coffee
        cup.\n[RV leaves room to retrieve Briscoe piece]\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n25\nRV: I had purchased one of Bob Briscoe\u2019s\u2014he
        calls it a \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d\u2014and for years that was my favorite
        bowl for breakfast. And I thought, Well, I got to start making some bowls.
        I really hadn\u2019t been doing much in the way of tableware, in these later
        years, because I really wasn\u2019t happy with the glazes for tableware. And
        so then I started doing more textural pieces and trying the ash glaze, and
        I really liked the glaze and the texture, so these are my own personal pieces
        now. I use them for breakfast and whatever.\nAW: How did you get this texture?\nRV:
        Okay, this texture is the same clay body but in a slip form, just creamy clay.
        And I add\u2014it\u2019s kind of thick\u2014and I add a small amount of sodium
        silicate, which gives it a flow-ability. And so [using the cup as an example]
        when this sets up a little bit\u2014the thrown piece\u2014before I trim the
        bottom I\u2019ll just take a brush, a flat brush, and brush on\u2014essentially
        it\u2019s these lines here, but they\u2019re straight lines\u2014and it builds
        up these lines right here. And I go around, and so it\u2019s got all this
        lines right here. And then I\u2019ll spin it on the wheel with a smaller brush,
        and that makes these lines. See? Those are the round lines. And then I finish
        it off with that same small brush, pulling up. And the slip is moving enough,
        so it gets these little curls and it\u2019s just a lot of fun.\nAW: Yeah,
        that\u2019s really a beautiful piece. And it\u2019s so nice to hold, it\u2019s
        kind of got that texture as well.\nRV: Yep, very tactile. I\u2019ve really
        appreciated the more rustic look, like Bob\u2019s work, but I just didn\u2019t
        make it. I thought, well, I\u2019m going to try working with the ash glazes.
        It seemed to get more of the rustic look on a porcelain. I did buy some stoneware
        and eventually I might actually bring it in the studio because I like how
        the glazes show up a little bit different, to just have that variety. And
        so I\u2019d like to develop more tableware. I just haven\u2019t done much
        tableware for years.\nAW: What were you mainly doing?\nRV: Well mostly the
        vases, planters. I was doing lamps. And maybe do a single display of a bowl
        or a bigger bowl or some small bowls, but not like cups and bowls, not so
        much. A little bit of cups, but not so much a [place] setting.\nAW: So it
        sounds like you\u2019re still exploring some of these styles\u2014\nRV: Yeah,
        a lot of vases\u2014I\u2019ll also show you this one\u2014[RV gets another
        piece].\nThis one, I\u2019m actually applying the slip for these leaves by
        taking a piece of sponge that\u2019s cut in a triangle shape. I just start
        at the top and then keep going down. I\u2019ll move it with either my finger
        or my sponge to clean it up. And then after that sets up a bit, then I added
        the center vein of the leaves.\nIt\u2019s very labor intensive, these pieces\u2014\n01:30:50\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n26\nAW: How long
        does it take?\nRV: That one? Might have five hours in that one. I really didn\u2019t
        keep track of it, but I noticed\u2014I thought I would take it a little bit
        further this time around, and then add these veins. I really like the veins.
        Plus adding so much time, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t
        know. It\u2019s hard for me to produce work that I\u2019m wanting to charge\u2014or
        needing to charge\u2014lots of money. I had a hundred and forty-five bucks
        on that and it didn\u2019t sell during the Tour. But that doesn\u2019t mean
        that it won\u2019t sell at the next show.\nAW: Yeah, how does that work in
        terms of pricing stuff for the Tour?\nRV: It\u2019s a great group to get a
        decent price. I think there are quite a variety of price points represented
        in the Tour. I know some people say, \u201cNo, they were over.\u201d I don\u2019t
        know if it was the Swanson\u2019s\u2014they had folks come from out east and
        they charge a lot for their pieces. I\u2019ve noticed when I\u2019ve been
        over there too. They must be selling it though, everybody\u2019s doing well.\nFor
        me I think it\u2019s just a quantity of work that\u2019s really holding me
        back. It\u2019s that five thousand dollar limit, though I had a good display
        this year when it was done.\nAW: You know, I was just noticing this vase on
        the table. Is that also part of your new or old work?\nRV: This one? It\u2019s
        very similarly made but I didn\u2019t do the pull up in between.\nAW: I see,
        wow, very beautiful.\nWho was the collector you said you went to go see who
        had a collection of your pieces? Do you remember the name?\nRV: Terri Chartrand.\nAW:
        And did she come again this year?\nRV: Yeah she did, and she came early (laughs)
        and she picked one of my favorite pieces. I thought, Yeah, it\u2019s going
        to a good home. It was a jar, actually in this type of geometric motif. She\u2019s
        from Wyoming, Minnesota.\nAW: So nearby?\nRV: Yep, relatively.\nAW: Have you
        gone to other collectors? Have you seen where your pots have ended up?\nRV:
        I\u2019ve delivered some pieces through the years but really haven\u2019t
        seen much, as far as the collection of my work, like I did there. And interesting
        enough, I became an instructor of a person who was starting to collect my
        work. She showed up this year and she was starting to ask A Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n27\nabout pottery classes. And
        I\u2019d been doing community education in the Chisago Lakes school system
        for years. We had an adult class coming up and she joined in. She realized
        through the class that pottery was very labor intensive. That\u2019s what
        she was saying, \u201cThis is very labor intensive,\u201d (laughs). She\u2019s
        got a very good appreciation for the amount of work we put into our pieces.\nAW:
        How many pieces do you make on average? And has it changed over the years?\nRV:
        Yeah, I don\u2019t really count\u2014I probably had about, maybe a hundred
        and fifty pieces for this show. I\u2019ve watched Bob Briscoe work, he just
        pulls that stuff out. Of course I have not seen a lot of his decorative, or
        the glaze application, how much time that takes. But I\u2019ve noticed some
        of these people have a very strong work ethic. And certainly I\u2019m weak
        in that, and personal work discipline. I don\u2019t produce what, I think,
        many of these other potters produce. Otherwise I\u2019d be doing more shows,
        galleries and such.\n01:35:15\nAW: Well, to have a hundred pieces and they
        all go, I mean that\u2019s a great sign too, that it\u2019s appreciated.\nRV:
        Yeah, the work is definitely desired. I really didn\u2019t count\u2014probably
        a couple kiln loads.\nAW: Yeah, when you first started was it around that
        same amount? Or did you do more early on? How has that changed over the years?\nRV:
        Well, when I first started my career I think I just did more bowls, cups and
        such. And I transitioned to the carved work, a lot of vases, planters. It\u2019s
        kind of like I\u2019m on an even keel of how much work I do. I think I worked
        harder before, when I became a housefather (laughs). And then kind of struggled
        getting into that passion of long hours again.\nAW: Yeah, I could see how
        that would be a hard transition. And you probably didn\u2019t really stop
        being the main parent at home for the kids, even when they were off at school.
        You were probably the first person they saw coming back after school. It\u2019s
        a lot of energy, a lot of time.\nRV: I\u2019m enjoying the slip texturing,
        I know\u2014I\u2019ve been inspired by some of my guest potters. I don\u2019t
        know if you know George Lowe\u2019s work? He\u2019s very textural with slips,
        not quite like this, but\u2014and of course I\u2019ve been doing the botanical
        slip texturing [but wanted to pursue something different]. His work really
        inspired me to pursue it, and what I was seeing of the local\u2014my guests\u2014what
        I was seeing of their textural work, and getting a kick out of it. It\u2019s
        not so focused as the leaves, the petals, type of thing, which is kind of
        good too because I do other pieces too that are very time consuming, of the
        botanical nature. And it takes a lot of focus to do that work. Really a lot
        of focus and time, and these other textural pieces, they\u2019re more quick
        and fluid and they just kind of happen. And they still kind of appeal to the
        eye and hand. So, I like mixing them, I think they work well together.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n28\nAW: Yeah,
        yeah, it\u2019s probably nice to have some of that variety when you\u2019re
        in the studio. So you don\u2019t get into the habit of making the same piece
        over and over and over again.\nRV: Right.\nAW: So talking about guest artists,
        how have you approached the guest artists over the years? The first person
        you invited because you just got to know him and you liked his work. Over
        the years what has been your criteria for guest artists?\nRV: Well I think
        the majority of them I did see at the American Crafts Council show, and appreciated
        their work; just in discussions with them about their work I appreciated their
        personalities. And I think that what\u2019s been important for me is appreciation
        of the work and the personality seemed to click. So then I\u2019d invite them
        and usually they would accept it right away and realized it was a good opportunity
        for them.\nInterestingly enough my guest potter, George Lowe, I had asked
        him early on in the show. I don\u2019t know if he would be my first guest
        I was asking, but he couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know if he was aware
        of the opportunity of the show, but he also had a conflict in a local show
        down there. And he finally started doing shows, and has been doing phenomenally
        well here. Though this coming year he\u2019s going off to Jerusalem to start
        a pottery school in a Christian ministry there, to the Christian Palestinians,
        through the Lutheran Church system. And so, why\u2019d I mention that? I guess
        it\u2019s just how I relate with him. So that\u2019s kind of interesting,
        he\u2019s hoping to be able to come back next year. He invited me to come
        on over to Jerusalem and visit him (laughs). I\u2019d love to be a workshop
        teacher in Jerusalem\u2014you know, who knows if anything like that will happen.\nAnd
        then more recently Richard Hensley and Donna Polseno\u2014they were at Bob
        Briscoe\u2019s for years. I really hadn\u2019t met them much, I didn\u2019t
        know them. But they showed up on a Sunday about three years ago. They told
        me their story, that Bob was not having them as guests next year, but he said
        to come on over and take a look and meet with me, to see if they could be
        guest potters here. And you talked about my faith. So I said, \u201cThat\u2019s
        quite interesting, I\u2019ll think about it, pray about it,\u201d I told them.
        And when I prayed about it, I heard this response. It was like this \u201cYes,\u201d
        and it was like this energy flow, it was just like, \u201cYES,\u201d and it
        went right through me. So I couldn\u2019t deny that (laughs). So I told them
        the story of what went on and they came to be my guests. And they\u2019re
        a really fun couple, so I really enjoy them and they work well here too. A
        different anecdote about\u2014and then Bob has sent other people too. There\u2019s
        a possibility of one of his guests who\u2014he\u2019s not inviting for next
        year\u2014he\u2019s got a whole different story. Did he tell you about the
        possibility of selling his place and all that?\nWell, one of his guests is
        going to be replaced with the person who he\u2019s planning to sell his studio
        and home to. And so, it\u2019s a possibility that he may be a guest. I know
        him from the Ren Fest for years and he\u2019s a pleasant guy. He\u2019s actually
        a co-worker, has been in the past, of one of my guests. It\u2019s a possibility
        if George doesn\u2019t show maybe he\u2019ll be a guest. Otherwise, I\u2019m
        not sure. It\u2019s been really hard to say good-bye to guests, and I really
        haven\u2019t chosen to do that, except the first guy, who wasn\u2019t working
        to good in the studio. And then another guy who, his second year here, he
        didn\u2019t do very well. So he really wasn\u2019t interested in coming back.
        And that\u2019s all I can say, I guess, unless you have more questions about
        guests? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n29\n01:42:44\nAW:
        Well how many guests did you have this year?\nRV: We had eight potters here,
        so I had seven guests. And I\u2019m pretty much at max at that.\nAW: Are there\u2014so,
        the Byers, did they continue on for a while?\nRV: Yeah, they\u2019re still
        continuing. He was my first guest after Scott Malcolm. And then she came on.
        And we have a strong relationship where they show here and then I show at
        their place in the fall. And that\u2019s another tour situation, it\u2019s
        called the Wisconsin Fall Art Tour. That\u2019s a mixed media show though
        and it\u2019s much larger than this one. But they actually saw what was going
        on here with the Tour, in relation with inviting guests. So she\u2019s been
        working on the committee there and she promoted the concept of guests and
        they okayed it. So I\u2019ve been a guest\u2014demonstrating potter there\u2014which
        is quite interesting, showing my slip or carving work and that\u2019s been
        very good for me to engage the people, to show what kind of work goes into
        the piece and get them interested in the work. So it\u2019s kind of a symbiotic
        relationship with them in that respect. I was invited also to show at the
        Polseno-Hensley \u201cSixteen Hands\u201d show and the fall show, but I opted
        out because I don\u2019t want to travel the twenty-one hours to get there.\nAW:
        Where are they?\nRV: They\u2019re in Floyd, Virginia. There\u2019s actually
        a group of them that show in this show too. Another one of the \u201cSixteen
        Hands\u201d people is a guest at Will and Janel\u2019s place. I don\u2019t
        know if they have Silvie Granatelli, if she\u2019s there too, or at one of
        the [other] show studios.\nAW: You said when you met Polseno and Hensley and
        you had that spiritual moment\u2014how did you connect with them?\nRV: I really
        appreciated their personality. She and him, they\u2019re very open, and easy
        to laugh and joke. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re Christian or into that
        at all, I just\u2014that was a private moment, when I prayed. I just shared
        that with them (laughs).\nAW: You did share that with them?\nRV: Yeah, I did
        share that I prayed and I heard that \u201cYES\u201d just fill me up. It was
        just so wild (laughs).\nAW: What was their response?\nRV: They probably got
        a kick out of it (laughs). I don\u2019t know. \u201cCool!\u201d\nYeah, this
        show has been incredible for them. They did phenomenal at Bob\u2019s and they\u2019ve
        done very good here too, though Richard always says it\u2019s his wife\u2019s
        work. I\u2019ll show you one of her pieces if you want\u2014I\u2019ll get
        it. [RV shows example of Donna Polseno\u2019s work.] A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n30\nWhat she does is she makes the
        original pieces, and then, I think this main piece here is molded\u2014a porcelain
        mold\u2014and then she does her design work. Yeah, her glazes are so nice,
        and her little birds and whatever she does.\nAW: So a similar botanical, natural
        design here?\nRV: In some respects right, but her forms are so different with
        the carving, or the manipulations that she\u2019s doing.\nAW: It\u2019s beautiful.
        Who are some of your other guests? And how have you gotten to know them?\nRV:
        Bill Gossman, who I met at an American Craft Council show\u2014I really appreciated
        how he was displaying his work and his forms, his pitchers\u2014his are wood-fired.
        This is actually a piece of his\u2014this huge\u2014[indicating an example
        of Bill Gossman\u2019s work]\u2014jar behind you here.\nAW: Oh wow, that\u2019s
        gorgeous. Are those dragonflies?\nRV: They\u2019re fish.\nThese larger pieces,
        when I saw them I thought, I\u2019ve got to have that. And this one\u2014it\u2019s
        kind of a funny story, is that I saw this\u2014it was like a can of spray
        or something\u2014of cleaning fluid, and I thought, Oh that\u2019s too evident
        in your display, Bill. And I just decided to come back there and say something
        about it. But when I went and saw it, I saw this thing, and it was displayed
        lower and I hadn\u2019t seen it before, and I just thought, Oh my god, I got
        to have that. (Laughs) So I do have some passion for some pots, but his pots
        really grab me. He\u2019s very playful, he does a lot of different things.
        And so I got him to give me a deal on that one (laughs).\nAW: They\u2019re
        just beautiful, wow.\nRV: Yeah. Did you get enough on guests or did you want
        some more?\nAW: Well, the guests you had this year\u2014Bill was part of it,
        and\u2014\nRV: Yep, and the next one over is Steven Hill.\nAW: Where is Bill
        Gossman from?\nRV: He\u2019s from New London, Minnesota, and he\u2019s actually
        been there for two years\u2014(laughs) smaller town.\nAW: And you said Steven\u2014?\nRV:
        Hill, yep.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n31\nAW:
        And how did you meet him?\nRV: I met him years ago at a local show that the
        Minnesota Crafts Council used to do at St. Kate\u2019s. And then at Bob\u2019s,
        he was there for a number of years, I can\u2019t remember how long. As it
        turned out I just felt like, what do we have, like two, three guests here?
        I was thinking, Well, we need some new blood. And I was just asking our [tour]
        group at our business meeting one spring, who\u2019d be a good person to bring
        in some new blood. People might be really interested in seeing their work.
        His name was one name of many. And so I decided to put the word out to him
        to see if he had interest, and he did. So he\u2019s been coming\u2014do you
        know his work at all? Here I\u2019ll\u2014[RV gets example of Steven Hill\u2019s
        work].\n01:50:00\nAW: We were just talking that it\u2019s amazing that you
        have all these pieces from guest artists here. It\u2019s really fun to see.\nRV:
        He has transitioned into cone six electric work, and he does a lot of workshops
        teaching that. And he gets into some odd shapes, he does some slip too. He
        sprays his glazes. I think it\u2019s all porcelain.\nAW: He sprays his glazes?\nRV:
        Yep, he sprays his glazes. And he\u2019s highly collected. He actually had
        this pitcher\u2014and he gets a phenomenal price\u2014that cup is fifty bucks
        and this pitcher was five hundred [dollars]. He gave me this pitcher, I would
        never have bought it, but I was just admiring them one day and he said, \u201cWell
        Richard, you can have this.\u201d (Laughs). I never objected, I guess. Well,
        I did object, I mean five hundred bucks for a great piece like that\u2014so,
        I\u2019ve either purchased or been given\u2014\nAW: It\u2019s incredible.
        Did you purchase many of these? Or were these gifts from the guests?\nRV:
        It depends who it is. These large ones of Bill\u2019s I definitely did purchase.
        He gave my wife\u2014sometimes my wife will get a gift for all the food preparation
        and stuff, and all the work she puts into it\u2014he gave her that one. And
        all these bowls, that\u2019s from Win Byers, and these platters I\u2019ve
        got up here. He usually gives my wife one and then Sandy Byers, she always
        gives me a piece for letting her show in my studio. So she\u2019s given me
        a collection of these [shows objects] through the years.\nRV: And her pieces
        start now at like a hundred and twenty [dollars] (laughs), for those. And
        these, well these go up to five hundred [dollars]. This one she had three
        hundred bucks or something on it. And she had some that have these square
        angles on this one year. And I know she\u2019ll be giving me one, so I said,
        \u201cCould you give me that one?\u201d And of course it had like five hundred
        bucks on it (laughter). I was just throwing it out there and she said, \u201cNo,
        the collectors want that one, but\u2014\u201d She ended up giving me that
        one; I couldn\u2019t believe it.\nAW: It\u2019s really amazing to see everything
        together you can really get a sense of connections between the guest artists
        and your work. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n32\nRV:
        I should show you\u2014[RV gets example of George Lowe\u2019s work]\nAnd this
        is a George Lowe, very earthy. He used to do wood-fire, but if you know anything
        about the wood-fire you know it\u2019s very labor intensive to fire it up
        with wood, hours and hours. It\u2019s a lot of serendipity, who knows what\u2019s
        going to happen to your pieces so he started doing a different process where
        he can get more of the earthy wood-fire look, but it\u2019s still gas.\nAW:
        How did he do that?\nRV: He\u2019s putting on a slip and then over his stoneware
        clay, and then he\u2019s sponging some of it off. And then he\u2019s spraying
        on some other stuff, and he sprays his glazes on. I don\u2019t know how to
        describe it, but if you want to see him describe how he does his work there\u2019s
        actually a video that I put on YouTube. I think it\u2019s under \u201cRichard
        Vincent Pottery.\u201d I actually did an interview of him about his work,
        the potters\u2019 tour, what he thought about it, and then describing his
        work and he describes the work process of his work, and it\u2019s kind of
        fun to watch. If you have an interest, get more detail about his work. He
        speaks about his work really nicely, he\u2019s been a professor so he knows
        how to give a spiel (laughs).\nAW: Have you done any instructing over the
        years?\nRV: I did do a workshop at Anoka Ramsey and that was really enjoyable.
        It was kind of like getting paid to have an audience as you do your work (laughs).
        I did some carving and slip application, and it was a lot of fun, and then
        I did a slideshow. Besides that I would like to do more workshops, but I\u2019ve
        been doing a lot of community education teaching for kids, kindergarten through
        middle school, and then adults or parent\/child groups through the Chisago
        Lakes, been doing a lot of that. We just got done with a series of four different
        class groups, plus adults. And you\u2019ve heard about these grants? The Community
        Education got a grant to bring in various motif or themed artists. So I was
        the potter. And they had painters, drawers, theater\u2014and at the end of
        all these classes they gather the kids work and we do a big art show at the
        high school. It was really cool. But I enjoy working with kids and they pay
        well, so that\u2019s been a good part time job. I really haven\u2019t pursued
        the workshop thing besides what I\u2019m doing with the Community Education
        and the one workshop at Anoka Ramsey\u2014that was invitational.\n01:56:05\nAW:
        Who invited you?\nRV: It was Mark Lambert. He\u2019s actually done a number
        of the workshops with the host potters. He asked to be my guest one year,
        but I just didn\u2019t want to go for that for some reason.\nAW: But he is
        a potter himself?\nRV: Yeah, he does pot, though he is a professor so I don\u2019t
        know how much potting he does.\nAW: Now why do you like community education
        so much? Why do you like working with kids? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n33\nRV: Well, I like sharing my knowledge with kids or
        adults. I do more of the kid\u2019s classes because they\u2019re more readily
        scheduled. I was invited to do that, and interesting enough\u2014we talked
        about the charity program\u2014he started out with one rented potter\u2019s
        wheel, and I was there doing the potting with a kid at the time, while the
        coordinator was doing hand building with the rest of the kids in class. And
        he said, \u201cRichard, it would be great if we could have more wheels. Do
        you know how we could get some more wheels?\u201d And I thought, Oh yeah,
        I know, I could ask the potter\u2019s group if they wanted to donate money
        for wheels to the Community Education. So I went to the business meeting that
        spring and they said, \u201cSure.\u201d So they granted six wheels that were
        transportable. They were beginners\u2019 wheels, so they\u2019re light, but
        they\u2019re stackable and stuff. So then the program\u2014it\u2019s just
        grown, it\u2019s just amazing. I think that was one of the great charity gifts
        because so many kids through the system, and adults, have worked with those
        wheels. And they ended up donating a kiln also. So the kiln gets use for those
        same classes.\nAW: What is it like to be\u2014I\u2019m just thinking back
        to when we started this interview, talking about being in high school and
        taking this class and starting to really enjoy it\u2014what is it like now
        to be, at this point in your life and your career, to be looking at kids who
        are experiencing their first time with clay? Or maybe their first time centering
        a pot or something? What is it like to be around them and to see them learn
        about this craft?\nRV: (Laughs) Not sure what to say\u2014well, I can see
        the difficulties, with the young kids it\u2019s quite difficult. You end up
        giving them a lot of help along the way. But to see them growing, it\u2019s
        very rewarding. Thrilled to see the creativity of some of the kids, it\u2019s
        just phenomenal how much they can produce. They really have a passion. This
        one young girl, she came up to me at the class one day and she says, \u201cI
        love this class!\u201d (Laughs).\nI like to see them growing in their work,
        appreciating their work. The school system, with Community Education, is kind
        of difficult because we don\u2019t have set classrooms where all this work
        can sit here until next week necessarily. It\u2019s always put into a storage
        area or you\u2019re competing with a teacher in her classroom a little bit.
        And then you have to set it up and tear it down, so it\u2019s a lot more work
        then I necessarily appreciate, but for the amount of time, I\u2019m getting
        paid well. But I appreciate working with the students. It\u2019s very rewarding
        to see the art show, and some of the kids come in and see their work displayed,
        sharing it with their parents, and their parents getting involved.\nYeah,
        I\u2019m just wondering if we\u2019re making progenies? I don\u2019t know
        if any of these students\u2014. For me, it\u2019s so different. I got a little
        bit of taste in ninth grade of pottery, but I didn\u2019t grab a hold of it.
        But some of these kids they keep coming back even in their young years, through
        middle school\u2014and so they\u2019re really growing and learning somewhat
        what clay is about. Most of them don\u2019t get to glaze their own work or
        see the kiln situation, but the adults do, and some of the parent\/child groups.
        It\u2019s very rewarding though to see them enjoying it. And then some of
        the pieces that they turn out\u2014it\u2019s amazing\u2014some of them have
        good, innate talent to create, and it\u2019s kind of fun.\nThe newest thing
        I started was four-by-four tiles. This one young guy he did a little tile
        so pretty, it was so pretty, really nice. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n34\n02:01:30\nAW: Why the tiles?\nRV: Well, I think it
        gets something simple\u2014the coordinator has really been focused on the
        wheel work\u2014personally I think hand building or wheel, it\u2019s just
        working with clay and there can be a lot of creative expression in the hand
        building. The tiles are very simple for younger folks to relate with. A lot
        of what the kids are making in the younger classes is just a bowl, because
        they can\u2019t pull up or they can\u2019t get the vase form too easily. The
        bowls are the easiest. They\u2019re creating simple forms that unless they\u2019re
        embellishing it much they don\u2019t really look like much, but a simple little
        bowl, you know? But the tiles, there they can really have some liberality,
        because you can draw on it, you can stamp on it. And sometimes it just really
        catches the eye, can really appreciate the design work.\nAW: Have any of the
        kids and their parents come to the Tour?\nRV: There has been some yes.\nAW:
        What has it been like for them?\nRV: I think they got a kick out of it. One
        young girl, her name was Ella, she was quite young to participate in the parent\/child
        group, and there were only two parent\/child groups in that class so I could
        spend a lot of time with her. And she made a tea\u2014a little tea set and
        stuff\u2014so she was very creative. And they came, and they really enjoyed
        their time. Some of the other adults and students showed up. I don\u2019t
        get much of the child groups coming in with their parents for some reason.
        I hand out the pottery tour flyer to the kids and adults a lot. I think a
        lot of those people, if they\u2019re participating; they\u2019re going to
        more of a local studio. At least I have not been aware of any of them coming.
        That one collector, Terri Chartrand, she was an adult student with a friend
        of hers one year. But she comes and\u2014I think it\u2019s one thing to put
        your kid in a pottery class where they can enjoy working with clay, and quite
        another thing to get involved with actually bringing them to a show where
        pots are being shown\u2014if they don\u2019t have the passion themselves.
        I have not done a specific mailing or personal invitations stating this is
        what I do, and it would be great if you could come, so-to-speak. I share it
        with the kids, they bring it home and their parents see it\u2014I don\u2019t
        know if they even understand what it is. (Laughs) Who knows?\nAW: The parent
        and kid classes, those sound really interesting too. Can you tell me a little
        bit more about those?\nRV: It\u2019s an opportunity for a parent to just learn
        pots and potting with their child. We do hand building or the pottery wheel,
        whatever they want to work on.\nAW: Do many of the parents that come to this
        class have previous experience?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n35\nRV: Sometimes they\u2019ve had some, maybe in high
        school or college setting, but most students haven\u2019t had much, if any,
        at all.\n02:05:05\nAW: Are they grabbing on to pottery as something they could
        keep doing or is this something special?\nRV: Well, there are a number of
        students, especially the adults that talk about how, \u201cOh, I\u2019d love
        to get a wheel,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m getting a wheel,\u201d you know, and
        \u201cHow much does a wheel cost?\u201d \u201cHow much is a kiln?\u201d It\u2019s
        kind of like, it\u2019s not a cheap hobby and then you have to have the space
        for those things too. Some seem to be more serious about wanting to at least
        learn and grow. Whether they will purchase the equipment that it takes, or
        not, time will tell I guess.\nAW: You said George is going to do this workshop
        that\u2019s also kind of a mission\u2014?\nRV: Well, yeah, I think it was
        mainly tourism [that brought them] over to the Middle East. He wanted to go
        to the historical birth of Christ and all that stuff, work with the Palestinians
        and stuff like that. They went to this ministry his wife\u2019s parents had
        been involved with through the years. They found out he [George] was a professor
        and they wanted to add some classes to their school and one of them was pottery
        [so they asked him to teach]. It sounds like she\u2019ll also be teaching
        basketry\u2014his wife\u2019s a basket person.\nSo\u2014what was the actual
        question?\nAW: If those kinds of things were common or if you had been on
        any trips like that\u2014where you go, and travel, and teach pottery in other
        parts of the world?\nRV: No, no.\nAW: Have you ever done anything like that?\nRV:
        No I haven\u2019t. That would be great; I\u2019d love to do that. When I went
        to India I did see a local potter in action but didn\u2019t get involved really
        and that would be fun. I know George; he\u2019s worked with Potters for Peace
        in Nicaragua, where they produce the water containers for purifying water.
        They teach local potters how to make them.\nAW: So, back to the guest artists,
        we\u2019ve gone through most of them. Are there any others that you want to
        mention?\nRV: Yeah, I think I pretty much described them all.\nAW: What do
        you think the Tour has meant for them?\nRV: It\u2019s been incredible for
        their sales. Donna Polseno, she says they haven\u2019t had a retirement account
        and this show has helped them really build their retirement account. Each
        one of them, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n36\nit\u2019s
        a financial boost, it\u2019s really good for them. Mainly it\u2019s that--they
        enjoy the show, the people, they\u2019re so motivated to come; they appreciate
        the work. Obviously many of them have a local clientele from doing the American
        Craft Council show or local shows through the years.\nAW: And what is your
        process for the week of the Tour? Does everybody come a couple of days early
        and set up? How does that work with your guests?\nRV: This year I asked that
        they [RV\u2019s guests] be sure to at least start setting up on Thursday.
        Some people require that they be all set up on Thursday. As it turned out,
        for us, some of them showed up later, thankfully we had the tents. But we
        had a deluge on Thursday, by the time a number of them showed up. But we did
        have a good portion set up. So most of them just come, I\u2019ve had maybe
        one guest just stay here through the years, but I usually don\u2019t host
        them at my house, so they are at the local hotels. I said I wanted everyone
        set up at nine [o\u2019clock] on Friday, you know the Friday of the show.
        (Laughs) I was the worst offender! I ended up doing some last minute photography
        of my work. There was new work and I just had to photograph it, and I finished
        up with that Thursday evening. So Friday came upon us and I wasn\u2019t quite
        ready at ten [o\u2019clock] (laughs)\u2014\n02:10:22\nAW: But you got everything
        set\u2014?\nRV: \u2014But that\u2019s the way it goes.\nAW: You said your
        daughter helps, and does your son help too?\nRV: My daughter comes on weekends
        to help the wife cook or carry out stuff to keep the table filled up. We do
        cookies, fruit water, and mixed fruit essentially\u2014tea, coffee. So, my
        wife\u2014we buy wholesale, the frozen cookie dough she would get from General
        Mills. So she\u2019s cooking either brownies or cookies all weekend long.
        And helping the folks to eat, she makes lunches. The son helps with some set
        up or sales. I might take a daughter to help with sales too, or my granddaughter\u2014she\u2019s
        very mature for her age, she\u2019s fourteen now. So she sometimes does sales
        with me. And the rest of them, some people require a helper, I don\u2019t
        require that. I\u2019m pretty comfortable in my approach. Just want them set
        up and to be around for the show. I don\u2019t know what else I could say.\nThis
        year we did a Saturday evening get together for dinner here. Friday evening,
        Bob has been doing a get together at his place, so those who want to go to
        that went to that. And that\u2019s about all I can say.\nAW: Then Thursday
        evening is Connie\u2019s place?\nRV: Yep, Connie, she has a group dinner for
        whoever signs up and wants to pay for that, they can go and do that.\nAW:
        So, it sounds like there are a lot of celebrations after each night. A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n37\nRV: Yep, and then
        Sunday evening Will and Janel\u2014for those that want to congregate at their
        place come and maybe half the show shows up there. As far as the potters or
        some helpers, you get in your last good-byes and visits.\nAW: How has the
        community developed amongst the hosts and with the guest artists? It seems
        like these dinners are a great way for people to meet each other.\nRV: It\u2019s
        true, and I imagine relationships have been built up through that intermixing.\nAW:
        Do you feel like there\u2019s a strong sense of community among the participants
        of the Tour?\nRV: Some of them, generally, yeah. I mean some of them have
        strong relationships even before they got here and that\u2019s why they invited
        them. I\u2019m friendly with these other potters, we don\u2019t get together
        typically and talk pots. I know once we did a salon at Connie\u2019s, where
        we actually had dinner and then brought our pots and talked about them. People
        gave comments or whatever too.\nSome people have more friendships that are
        kind of ongoing. I know Linda and Guillermo, they were friends before. She
        was the one who kind of introduced him to the group and asked that he could
        be a host. And some of them maybe meet more regularly.\nAW: Do you meet up
        with many of the other [host] potters?\nRV: Not besides business. You know
        I\u2019ve done some, like skiing with Will in the past, [and] different shows.
        It\u2019s called \u201cArt\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t remember the name of it\u2014it\u2019s
        this gallery in Stillwater, they did a group show with us as host potters.
        And then this past winter we did what they call a \u201cpop-up gallery\u201d
        in an empty shop that they were able to move into for the holiday season.
        Many of us showed at that and that was good. Both shows have been good for
        us.\nAW: Now you\u2019ve known Will and Janel for quite a long time right?\nRV:
        Right\u2014\nAW: So, have you guys maintained a good friendship here through
        the pottery? And how did you get to know Janel?\n02:15:00\nRV: Well, I met
        her at the Ren Fest just walking around the show, seeing her do a little demonstration.
        So I met her and then Will showed up in the scene, met him there. And we spent
        some time\u2014I\u2019m not that sociable of a person though. I\u2019ve skied
        with Will before. We talk when we meet. Usually it\u2019s in relation to business,
        besides that it\u2019s not like, \u201cCome on over we\u2019ll have dinner,\u201d
        so-to-speak, and let\u2019s do this and whatever. Once in a while it\u2019ll
        happen, but it\u2019s not so much of a\u2014we\u2019re supporting each other
        along the way\u2014maybe some of them are much more A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n38\nthat way. I don\u2019t know if
        some of them went to school together, if they\u2019ve had a relationship even
        before the Tour?\nAW: What has being part of this [potters] community meant
        to you?\nRV: It definitely gives me the opportunity in the springtime to show
        my work to a very appreciative audience\u2014extremely appreciative. It\u2019s
        helped me to meet other potters, I suppose, spending time building relationships
        with these guests along the way. Certainly that symbiotic relationship I have
        with the Byers that gives me an opportunity for a good show in the fall too,
        at their place, spending time with them and their family. They\u2019re more
        of a business relationship, but with the other potters it\u2019s been good.
        I\u2019ve certainly met some more people, like at Northern Clay Center, or
        Mark Lambert. I suppose they\u2019ve taken notice of me more by meeting me
        along the way\u2014on the Tour, that I\u2019m a part of it. I suppose it gives
        you, as a potter, a certain respect from the general audience out there, if
        you\u2019re a potter in this show. It is considered a high quality show of
        potters.\nAW: Tell us a little more about that, what the Tour has meant to
        the larger community?\nRV: I think it\u2019s been an example for other groups
        to draw from, and I know there have been a good number of offshoots, so-to-speak,
        where they saw the example of what the Tour was doing, and many tours, I think,
        have developed by seeing what\u2019s going on here and how successful it\u2019s
        been for us. I know there\u2019s been lot of people who would like to either
        be a host\u2014and we haven\u2019t wanted to add more hosts because we\u2019re
        kind of at a manageable size right now, it seems to work well. But the addition
        of the guests has expanded it and also added interest.\nAW: Speaking of the
        connection to the greater public, and other public audiences, before the Tour
        how did the public interact with your work? You said you did a few shows?\nRV:
        Yeah, I did the American Craft Council show, a number of summer shows in the
        cities\u2014\nAW: And then you said you got a website set up at some point?\nRV:
        I have a basic website, though I\u2019ve been really lagging behind on my
        internet presence. I\u2019ve got a site on MNartists.org that I put together
        years ago, and it\u2019s very much needing updating, which I haven\u2019t
        gotten to. For some reason I haven\u2019t made that a goal and a priority
        to get to. I don\u2019t have my new work on there. I did purchase a domain,
        richardvincentpottery.com, but I haven\u2019t\u2014I was thinking of producing
        one through one of these \u201cfit in your parts,\u201d like on Weebly. I
        haven\u2019t found something that works and I\u2019m thinking that I should
        get more serious about that and get a webmaster to work with me and put the
        money into it. I\u2019ve certainly, through the years received a good number
        of purchase orders through my website. People see me online, even from other
        states surprisingly. But it needs more up-building to get \u201cwith it\u201d
        in the technical era that we\u2019re in here. I think web presence is good.
        I\u2019m considering the Etsy thing, and I haven\u2019t got that going yet.\n02:20:30\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n39\nAW: How do
        you think new technologies and internet have changed the Tour over time?\nRV:
        Certainly the website that is produced has been very helpful to connect with
        the greater public, nationally. I imagine\u2014have you seen the website?
        Yeah, and people can tie into the mailing, tell us a little bit more about
        who you are. Helps people to judge where they want to go, perhaps, I\u2019m
        not sure. It\u2019s interesting when you listen to people, \u201cOh I\u2019ve
        come to the Tour for years, but I\u2019ve never been here,\u201d but they\u2019re
        thrilled to have found us. For whatever reason they didn\u2019t choose to
        come here, they may have ties to some of these other potters, who are really
        big in the collector\u2019s world. And so, it\u2019s thrilling\u2014people
        really enjoy it when they get here.\nAW: What have been some of your fondest
        memories of the Tour?\nRV: Fondest memories? It wasn\u2019t so much this year,
        but for many years it\u2019s been where Bill Gossman\u2019s brother comes
        and plays guitar. He\u2019s a great guitarist. On Sunday after you\u2019ve
        lived with all this appreciation of your work, people pouring out their money
        into your household and mixing that with this beautiful guitar music, it can
        just be this overwhelming joy. That\u2019s\u2014I\u2019ve experienced that
        through the years. I used to experience that at the Ren Fest too (laughs).
        It\u2019s just great to have your work appreciated by people, they want it\u2014it
        really is great.\nAW: What have been some of the successes of the Tour?\nRV:
        Certainly, as a whole, the financial gain for the potters has been excellent
        for most of them, many of them, national notoriety, where collectors will
        fly in from around the nation. I\u2019ve heard of other people from different
        countries, but I haven\u2019t met them so much. It has a lot of respect with
        the quality of the work.\nAW: What makes it successful do you think?\nRV:
        Certainly the promotion. And the different people who are the hosts, who have
        strong connections to the potting world. There are a number of them that are
        the caliber that will get accepted into the top shows, like the Smithsonian
        Craft Show and such, and have wide-ranging connections to education institutions
        where they can encourage students to come, participate in viewing the work,
        see what\u2019s going on here, the galleries and schools that will help promote
        it. And certainly that\u2019s helping to draw in the students, many of them
        come and buy too. And many of them are learning along the way from the potters
        too [also].\nI suppose that\u2019s some of my fondest memories too, is when
        you get to interact with students or people involved with different stages
        of their work. They really want to know what you work is, and you can describe
        it and how you go about it. For the last couple of years we actually had a
        high school tour coming and that\u2019s been fun. This year they seem to be
        much more open to asking questions and receiving the ideas. To me those are
        some of the fondest memories, when you really get involved with the work and
        describing it, and people really have a passion, and maybe want to do it themselves.\n02:25:25\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n40\nAW: What
        have been some of the challenges in doing the Tour? Have there been any challenges
        in doing the Tour?\nRV: Just in preparation. We have this large, grassy yard,
        and I feel like I have to clean it up after winter. And so getting people
        to help with that, and getting that part prepared, getting my own work done,
        learning how to time it all, making sure I\u2019ve got the help. You know,
        for the last eight years I\u2019ve been the treasurer and one of the biggest
        challenges is trying to get this\u2014I\u2019ve chosen to have the final fee
        finished up prior to the event starting so that\u2019s been kind of like the
        last week thing. When you\u2019re trying to finish up your work, trying to
        get that done too\u2014the expense statement, so I can come up with what our
        balance needs to be. Just getting it all set up.\nCommunications, I mean it\u2019s
        a challenge having to communicate with all these artists, make sure they\u2019re
        getting their slides in\u2014well, now it\u2019s digital\u2014and images.
        Getting paid, sometimes you get a potter along the way somewhere who can\u2019t
        pay, you know. But you work that out. And just doing the bookwork with that,
        it\u2019s an added responsibility though I enjoy giving that part of me to
        the potting community. For years I was more just helping get the word out,
        spreading the flyers around. I thought I would take a more active role and
        I seemed to be needed, there needed to be a new treasurer.\nAW: How exactly
        did you get into the role of treasurer?\nRV: Somebody did it and they said
        they couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I thought it was time for me to step up
        and take a more active role in the group and giving to that community, so
        I said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d And thankfully my wife, she has good
        spreadsheet [skills] she knows how to set that up. So she\u2019ll actually
        help me write that up for the group too, when it comes time to finalize it
        all for the expenses of the year. I mean the checkbook is not that hard, but\u2014\nAW:
        So how did the Tour do this year? Despite these really cold Fridays--?\nRV:
        Well for me I think I had my best Friday. The weather didn\u2019t hold me
        back at all. I probably had close to my best year monetarily. Some of the
        years I\u2019ve gone to the end of Saturday and think, Oh I don\u2019t have
        much for Sunday. This year I had a pretty nice looking display on Sunday and
        I still did well. For me it was a great year. I still need to learn how to
        get out four kiln loads instead of two\u2014that would help. I heard that
        everybody did well, some of them did a bit more, a bit less, but everybody
        is happy. Some people here had their best year or close to it.\nAW: Why do
        you think this year was the best year?\nRV: As far as some who did the best,
        I wouldn\u2019t know. If they had more work, time was right for them, other
        people, their pricing, I really don\u2019t know. We had good attendance here.\nAW:
        So what would be the highest that a studio host and a guest could total?\nRV:
        Oh, in a studio?\nAW: Well, I mean, yeah, for one of the\u2014 A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n41\nRV: Or a guest? Or host?\nAW:
        Host and guest together. Do you compile that each\u2014?\nRV: I did not this
        year, I only heard from some of them.\nAW: Okay\u2014\nRV: What they did and\nAW:
        What\u2019s the ballpark?\nRV: Well I\u2019d say if you\u2019re going to talk
        about potters as a whole, from studio to studio, maybe a few thousand to twenty
        thousand [dollars], close to twenty thousand, fifteen to twenty thousand.
        I mean I\u2019ve heard that number in the past. I didn\u2019t hear from anybody
        what they actually did, as far as the hosts. Some of those hosts, it\u2019s
        phenomenal though, what they\u2019ve done. So that\u2019s a great financial
        uptick.\n02:30:30\nAW: Now for individual guest artists\u2014what\u2019s an
        average of what they make? Or does it change a lot from year to year?\nRV:
        I think it depends on who. Here at this place we\u2019ve had anywhere from\u2014well,
        the low end close to sixteen thousand [sic; corrected by RV to one thousand]\u2014that
        was the guy who didn\u2019t come back the following year. The high end has
        maybe been about ten [sic; corrected by RV to fifteen] thousand, so that\u2019s
        what we fluctuate around here.\nAW: So, an individual would be making that
        much?\nRV: Yeah, an individual.\nAW: Oh, I see.\nWell that\u2019s great!\nRV:
        Yeah, for three days of sales.\nAW: Yeah, and it seems like weather is always
        a factor, but it doesn\u2019t seem to influence\u2014or maybe it does encourage
        people to buy more?\nRV: I think if it\u2019s crappy weather maybe they move
        faster? You know, \u201cIt\u2019s cold I\u2019ve got to keep moving.\u201d
        But this year it didn\u2019t hold people from coming and buying. It sounded
        like a lot of people had really good Fridays, and that was really a lousy
        weather day.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n42\nSaturday
        was decent, the weather was pleasant, sales weren\u2019t quite as strong for
        me, but still very good. Sunday was kind of like the \u201coff day,\u201d
        sounded like, for a lot of people.\nAW: Is that typical from year to year?\nRV:
        Usually it is, and the Sunday crowd at shows can often be\u2014you know, many
        people who aren\u2019t as motivated to get there right away. They don\u2019t
        necessarily have all the money, they just want something to do on a Sunday
        afternoon, take a look\u2014so I\u2019m sure, that\u2019s the only day they
        could get there and they\u2019ll buy. It seems like a different crowd on Sundays
        at most shows.\nAW: Who is there on Sundays typically? Do people come for
        Mother\u2019s Day celebrations?\nRV: Well sometimes it is, but it\u2019s just
        less people. And less of the strong, motivated collectors who know they have
        to get there the first time around. It\u2019s just more casual people.\nAW:
        When did you guys start offering cookies and brownies and food and drinks
        and stuff?\nRV: I think that all started in the beginning. We don\u2019t offer
        alcohol here. I think Guillermo offers wine, I don\u2019t know if he does
        beer. I know it\u2019s Bob who has been big on his kegs of beer through the
        years. It\u2019s a bit of a concern for some of us because it is a driving
        tour. And thankfully we haven\u2019t had any major issues when it comes to
        the actual driving. I think sometimes people get too intoxicated over at Bob\u2019s
        (laughs), but\u2014when you have free kegs of beer\u2014\nAW: When you\u2019re
        out in the woods, in this beautiful landscape\u2014\nRV: Yeah, some people
        kind of just live there too, cause maybe they\u2019re volunteers, maybe they\u2019re
        staying the weekend\u2014nothing to stop them. I don\u2019t know if the people
        who are actually doing the Tour do a lot of [drinking and] driving, hopefully
        they\u2019re not getting too intoxicated. I haven\u2019t heard of that one.\nAW:
        Yeah, right. Do you think it helps to have the food and stuff? Does that kind
        of welcome people? Do many tours do that?\nRV: Oh yeah. I think many do at
        least something. We get comments about the hospitality; they really appreciate
        that. I know that one thing that\u2019s different about this tour [site] is
        that we do our own sales. I think the majority of the hosts have central sales
        tables. But I\u2019ve never wanted to do that, my guests don\u2019t want to
        do that. It\u2019s a whole different thing when you have to go to finalize
        the sales portion. Actually, my wife heard a comment this year about that,
        which was interesting, I\u2019ve never thought of it that way, that these
        people were talking about how they really appreciated giving their money to
        the potter because we, as the potters are selling work directly to them, as
        opposed, they said, to some of the other places feeling like a Target cashier,
        where you\u2019re just coming up to anybody cashiering. I was surprised to
        hear that. I\u2019ll share that this year since at the business meetings some
        are thinking that\u2019s the way we should be going. They haven\u2019t forced
        us to do that. But I think it can be a little interruptive for some who want
        to buy their stuff and get moving. If they\u2019re buying from multiple potters
        in one spot, then they have to go to each potter to pay. But I was surprised
        to hear that comment from a visitor, that they really A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n43\nliked sharing their money directly.
        And that\u2019s what some of my hosts [guests] have said; they really appreciate
        that opportunity to meet with the costumer, and the passing of money and the
        expression of appreciation they get in that moment of the sale.\n02:36:00\nAW:
        Yeah, I could understand that too because you don\u2019t get to do that very
        often any more, with the way that business is conducted now online all the
        time.\nRV: Or at the galleries, or consigning your work, or wholesaling.\nAW:
        Well, thank you for all of your time. I just have one or two last reflective
        questions here. This is kind of a big question, but what has pottery meant
        in your life?\nRV: It\u2019s an avenue for my creative expression. I\u2019ve
        thought in the past that I\u2019m just somebody who has to create. Obviously
        with my connection to clay at an early age and I just got hooked. So that\u2019s
        been my avenue for creativity. I\u2019ve also been doing nature photography
        for a number of years, but I haven\u2019t found that to be particularly monetarily
        fulfilling. But knowing that any business you have to promote, and promote,
        you have to market photography. I know nature photographers say that you have
        to market like eighty percent of your free time, and that\u2019s not my thing
        (laughs).\nAW: Why do you like the nature photography?\nRV: I get involved
        with the nature, not just to look at it and experience it, but to capture
        it and share it with others. It\u2019s that capturing and sharing which is
        fun. It\u2019s capturing the moment, the beauty of the moment.\nAW: What do
        you see pottery meaning now and into the future?\nRV: Well it\u2019s definitely
        my livelihood. I feel like my wife wants to retire coming up next year, and
        so I really have to get on the ball and learn to make more income out of it.\nAW:
        So you think you\u2019ll actually increase production?\nRV: Yeah, I can definitely
        see a lot of opportunity there to increase production. That\u2019s why I\u2019m
        wondering about the photography. When I was a worship leader I was putting
        in quite a few hours in a weeks time with that too. Even though I enjoyed
        it, there was a lot of responsibility there too. Now I don\u2019t have that
        [worship leading], it\u2019s just getting myself motivated to produce and
        come out, work and bring in the income.\nAW: Are there other crafts or art
        that you\u2019re pursuing? Or other passions you have in life?\nRV: No, besides
        the music and photography, no, not that I would say.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Vincent\n06\/09\/14\n44\nWell, gardening, I used to have
        quite a passion for gardening. I did the vegetables and the flowers. We\u2019ve
        got some gardens, they\u2019re mostly perennial, but they still take time.
        We\u2019re growing another little garden out here just for landscaping purposes.
        I was a birder so to do the garden, to increase hummingbird activity in the
        garden, and butterflies, so I still do some gardening. But it\u2019s hard
        to spend a lot of time in the soil (laughs). That used to be a strong passion
        of mine\u2014organic gardening.\n02:40:10\nAW: You were just describing to
        us this new design that you\u2019re working on. Do you hope to continue doing
        more of this tradition?\nRV: The slip texture? Definitely. And add more tableware;
        just expand my line of products. And if I could make more in the year, I guess
        I can improve my sales.\nAW: That\u2019s great! And then the last question,
        what are your hopes for the Tour in the future?\nRV: Just that it keeps going
        strong. We\u2019re all getting old\u2014older, put it that way (laughs)\u2014it\u2019s
        hard to know what will happen in the coming years. To me it seems like if
        it could just continue similarly the way it\u2019s happening, well, that\u2019s
        just great. It seems to be doing what it was intended to do, give many potters
        the opportunity to show their work, meet with collectors, sell it, and financially
        support themselves.\nAW: Any comments about what the Tour has meant in your
        life? You said it\u2019s helped you build relationships. Anything else about
        what the Tour has meant to you?\nRV: I suppose I\u2019ve grown, just intermixing
        with the potters, and being the treasurer, just giving me great opportunity
        to show my work. I\u2019m not sure what else to say about it.\nAW: Well you
        have said a lot already so these reflection questions sometimes go back over
        some things. But sometimes new things come up, so it\u2019s important to ask.
        Thank you so much Richard, for sharing all this time and your stories with
        us. Anything else you want to add?\nRV: Thank you for having an interest and
        doing this work. Hopefully it\u2019ll inspire somebody else I suppose, who
        takes a look at it, or to consider it historically if that\u2019s their interest.
        I don\u2019t know, it\u2019ll be interesting to hear of anything that actually
        transpires because they heard of this.\nAW: Yeah, yeah it will.\nWell, thank
        you, we will end here.\n02:42:58\nEND OF INTERVIEW\n","transl":{},"fullrs":{},"find":"99.pdf","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2015-02-06","dmmodified":"2015-02-06","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"98","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"421803","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.40

        00:00:00\nAW: This is Andy Wilhide interviewing Edie Abnet on June 23, 2014
        in Stillwater, Minnesota, at her home. This interview is for the A Measure
        of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,
        made possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grants. Also
        present during this interview is Tierney McNabb who is our project assistant.
        Thank you, Edie, for agreeing to be interviewed. Why don\u2019t we get started?
        If you want to start with when and where you were born and when and where
        Richard was born, your former husband?\nEA: Richard was born in 1934 in February
        in Le Crescent, Minnesota. He was the son of farmers and he was also Swiss.
        It''s down in the Le Crescent area where the ice flow never went, so it''s
        extremely rolling and hilly country along the Mississippi River down there
        by La Crosse and Le Crescent. The Swiss loved it when they moved down there
        in the late 1800s and set up farming. That is where he''s from, Le Crescent,
        Minnesota.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n2\nAW:
        Do you know much about his childhood?\nEA: He was the second of six children.
        In 1934, by that time it was the very early stages of the Depression\u2014the
        worst of the Depression. His father was one of four sons, living and renting
        a farm from his grandfather''s\u2014the father''s father\u2014who was kind
        of a mercenary guy. Farmers were not making money at that time; they were
        trying to sell hogs and they couldn''t make enough money selling their hogs
        to pay the rent, so the grandfather kicked, essentially, the son and his little
        children off the farm so they had to move in to La Crosse. Those sort of things
        greatly influenced Richard, but also the aesthetics of the land was very important
        to him and the attitude: the work ethic of the farmer. You get up in the morning
        and before you care for yourself you have to take care of the livestock and
        you have to take care of the land, and it was a deep respect for that aesthetic
        that influenced his life as an artist, a craftsmen. Richard would never refer
        to himself as an artist; he called himself a craftsmen. In the thirty years
        that we were married there was not a morning that he did not get up\u2014unless
        the last few years of his life when he was quite ill but working as an active
        potter\u2014that he wasn\u2019t out in the barn by eight o''clock every day
        and that was his regime. He was not, by any means, a dilettante. He looked
        at it as a very serious thing and deeply involved, as a potter, in the process
        of the land and the pots and the clay; it was all one and the same for him.\nAW:
        When he was growing up, what was his schooling like?\n00:04:03\nEA: For the
        first six years of his life he went to a one-room schoolhouse and there were
        twelve people in that schoolhouse, and he was related by blood to eight of
        them. So for six years he did that and then when they went into junior high
        and high school, they had moved and he went to a La Crosse school, he went
        to Aquinas High School, which was a Catholic high school; so that''s where
        he finished his education.\nAW: Did he ever reflect on those experiences?
        The schoolhouse, what was that like?\nEA: Oh, amazing. He had amazing stories.
        We have tapes of his storytelling and some of the characters. He had very
        vivid memories of when they farmed\u2014the farmers in the Valley all farmed
        together. This was during the end of that great agrarian period when farmers,
        before things became extremely mechanized\u2014before he was 10 years old,
        he could hitch up a team of horses and plow and take care of fields. And what''s
        interesting about that, in terms of the believability, is that The Little
        House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, I read an interview of
        her and she had said, \u201cI had to increase the ages of the children by
        three and four years, at least, because nobody would believe what little children
        were doing at that time.\u201d And then there''s another history I read, Lark
        Rise to Candleford\u2014which was a series on British television\u2014but
        in fact is the name of a book, a history book, of the last of the agrarian
        period before the Industrial Revolution. I sort of liken Richard\u2019s experience
        as similar to that. Children, in this book before they went into school\u2014there
        wasn\u2019t schooling\u2014so toddlers by the time they could walk and speak
        they were taking care of infants; they would be in groups taking care of infants.
        And pretty much Rich\u2019s childhood\u2014he was the second oldest\u2014and
        the three oldest would get up\u2014I mean, we\u2019re talking grade school\u2014and
        have to go out to the barn, the smallest A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n3\nboy who might have been six or five, would be so tired
        he often would fall asleep in the hay mow, but the boys would muck out the
        barn, they would have their cows that they milked, feed the chickens, and
        any other livestock. So there was a real sense of work and responsibility
        and he never saw it as a burden, he himself never saw it as a burden. At the
        same time he said, \u201cWe used to pray for rain,\u201d to give themselves
        time off. But the parents worked extremely hard right alongside them and this
        all influenced the idea of working with his hands was tied in with that agrarian
        background, very closely, and the caring for the land.\nAnd when he bought
        this place in 1960 that was all part of it. This was an old rundown\u2014well,
        this was a horrible rundown farm. This was one of those farms that you go
        by in the country with the broken buildings and the pathetic cattle and the
        trash everywhere; this was literally what this place was. It''s unrecognizable
        to what he bought. There were no trees; I have pictures of bald hills and
        a rundown barn in between. This house was built in stages, between the original
        house and the barn was this massive trench because\u2014this is the third
        stage of the St. Croix River historically, the St. Croix River is an ancient
        river and all the lands graduates down, slowly goes down to the river, tilts
        that way. So the hundred some acres up on the hill all run and they would
        run by between when it rains or melts, it would always run between this house
        and the barn. But anyway he saw that there was a hill back here and rolling
        reminded him of Le Crescent and when he saw it, he knew immediately, he had
        been looking and looking. When he got out of graduate school\u2014he went
        to the School of American Craft in Rochester, New York\u2014when he got out
        of there he moved back here to look\u2014he had saved all the money when he
        was in the Marine Corps, he had saved everything he ever had\u2014and started
        looking for places to set up his pottery. And it was like setting up a farm
        basically for him. But he was married\u2014by this time he was twenty-six\u2014and
        had a baby so they moved into a pretty rundown place.\n00:09:39\nAW: To back
        up a little bit, when he transitioned from the schoolhouse into the high school,
        did he ever reflect on his experiences?\nEA: It was hard. He always had a
        deep sense of art, and he used to talk about\u2014there is a lot of soil that
        has a lot of clay in it and he remembers that he would go off and he always
        wanted to leave something of himself and he talked about making little square
        cubes of clay and leaving them in the hillsides hoping that this would be
        preserved and he was leaving something of himself on the landscape. He talked
        about it because when he went to Aquinas he was a country farmer boy and there
        were city kids and he was painfully always aware of\u2014because they always
        worked in the barn before they went into the schoolroom--they probably smelled
        like cattle manure and that was always, \u201cOh.\u201d But education and
        reading were very important in that family. Everybody''s got a college education\u2014every
        one of them has a college education, except the oldest brother. It was natural
        back than that the oldest brother got the farm.\nAfter high school, what they
        did was they all\u2014from the father\u2014they were expected to work for
        a year before they went into the armed forces. So he enlisted in the Marine
        Corps and that was right after the Korean War. So after a year of working
        on the farm\u2014and his brother at that point had bought it\u2014he went
        overseas. It was a huge experience for him. He did basic training at Camp
        Lejeune, I think, in California and then shipped out to Korea. One of the
        things that he A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n4\nsays
        about that\u2014well, he says a lot of things that don\u2019t apply anything
        to his career\u2014but once he became a potter, when he looked back in an
        appalled manner about was, historically\u2014the Koreans were the first aesthetic
        artists of pottery. That was where pottery started: was in Korea. There was
        pottery shards just laying in the fields, and he thinks, \u201cMy gosh, how
        I never could have even noticed it.\u201d After the Korean War\u2014that was
        a four-year brutal battle, 58,000 Americans killed and the countries of North
        and South Korean were so devastated\u2014it was so appalling just to see the
        refugee problem that he talked about that. Then when he went on leave to Japan
        and again the architecture of the temples all made of wood, but he was unaware
        at that time of thinking in terms of ceramics. That happened after he came
        back here and started at St. Mary''s University. He started taking classes
        at St. Mary''s University in Winona and then after a year he transferred to
        the University of Minnesota. Just left the farm and said, \u201cI\u2019m out
        of there,\u201d much to the chagrin, of course, to his father and brother.
        But he was never going to work under an older brother. It was just never going
        to work. They were bright men that needed to go on and there was going to
        be only one owner of that farm and that was his brother Greg.\nHe wanted to
        go into architecture\u2014that\u2019s what he hoped to do. He started in architecture
        and one of the prerequisites, of course, is that you take art classes. He
        talked a lot about\u2014what was her name? It\u2019ll come to me\u2014and
        he had her as an art instructor. He was there a year, I think. He also worked
        as an orderly, a nurse\u2019s aid, and so he worked at the university hospitals
        as an orderly and worked his way through\u2014that was when you could have
        a job and get out of the university without much debt. But then he talks about
        that he had to sign up for a class with Warren MacKenzie. Warren was ten years
        older than him exactly\u2014actually his birthday, Warren\u2019s birthday\u2014in
        fact I saw him a couple months ago and he had just turned ninety in February
        and Rich\u2019s birthday was in February too; Rich would have been eighty.
        He said he walked in there and literally his words were, \u201cBlown away,\u201d
        and he never looked back. He decided that when he started that class that
        that was it. He was so smitten by it that Warren would give him the keys to
        the pottery studios. He would go in there after hours. Nobody would be there
        but he \u201ccould not work,\u201d he said\u2014he couldn\u2019t work because
        everybody was goofing off, and he was a very serious artist. He was single-minded
        and he went in there and just threw and threw until he could throw the way
        he wanted to.\nAfter he graduated he accepted\u2014I don\u2019t remember all
        the places he applied for. Back then he was a very focused person; he knew
        what he wanted to do. He knew what his dreams were. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh,
        maybe I\u2019ll do this.\u201d No, he knew exactly what he wanted to do. So
        he had met his first wife at the University Hospital and she was a nurse and
        they were married and within a year they had a baby. She was pregnant when
        they went to the East Coast and he was accepted into the School for American
        Crafts. He studied under a man named Frans Wildenhain who was at the Bauhaus
        and who had escaped from Germany. There were a couple famous German artists
        that were there, and the attitude of these people really influenced him. He
        always thought in terms of functional pottery, you know, ceramics and doing
        pottery as a functional form for people to use in everyday life and use. I
        think it was Bob Briscoe\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was unique to Bob Briscoe,
        but maybe he doesn\u2019t take credit for it\u2014the idea that you could
        make something that somebody would put their lips on, probably appealed to
        him too. But he would''ve always made something, built something with his
        hands, that''s the way he was. He was also, I used say, \u201cA frustrated
        carpenter,\u201d but he clearly wasn\u2019t frustrated. He did a lot of carpentry
        on this place. When he left he actually was the first from that university
        [School for American Crafts] to get a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n5\nmaster\u2019s degree in ceramics. Nobody had ever gotten
        that before. They had always gotten their degrees in design and he wanted
        it in ceramics. Here is that Rochester Institute of Technology [letter] that
        talks about that.\n00:18:45\nAW: This is a letter from 1960: \u201cThe Graduate
        Selection Committee has met and has approved your candidacy for the MFA Degree
        in Ceramics. This is rather an unusual honor, for customarily this selection
        committee asks that the candidate work for his Master\u2019s in the field
        of Design.\u201d Wow, that\u2019s really incredible. Did he reflect on that,
        what is was like to be the first one to do that? What his students, fellow
        colleagues said or faculty said?\nEA: No, no, he was a very modest man. He
        didn\u2019t reflect on that. You know, when we would have discussions about
        art\u2014I am a painter. I was married--both Richard and I were married--we
        were in second marriages. He had four children and I had three, so we brought
        very complicated past lives to our life together and we were married thirty
        years. But it was interesting as a woman. I had a grandmother, who was a painter,
        but she didn\u2019t have a formal degree, but she was very creative and she
        wrote poetry and I have some of her paintings, which are dispersed throughout
        the family. But at the same time I always felt inadequate because I didn\u2019t
        have that degree, but painting was clearly very important and he really supported
        that. He had this bona fide, you know, important background and it was very
        important to me to be encouraged by him, but when I would get frustrated and
        say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just doing schluck,\u201d and dismissive about what
        I was doing, he always said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your job to worry about that.
        Your job is the process, that\u2019s what\u2019s critical here; it\u2019s
        only the process, if it\u2019s important to you, this is what you do.\u201d
        And that was how he saw himself. Did he ever pat himself on the back? Never,
        no, he was not that kind of person. He never, never talked about himself.
        He would talk about art, he was very self-effacing, but he had a real sharp
        sense. He didn\u2019t have a lot of time, though, for people that used their
        creative talents in any kind of social way as far as getting ahead or getting
        involved in a certain group; he had no respect for that at all, and it just
        wasn\u2019t who he was. He was here to make pots, make art, and that was it.
        He didn\u2019t feel he had a responsibility to do anything but that. He was
        a huge reader of history and greatly respected the whole attitude of the Asian
        artisan and their single-mindedness in terms of devotion to their craft, and
        that superseded even the individual or who they were.\nAW: Did he go to Japan
        and study with anybody or do workshops?\n00:23:20\nEA: No, right after MIT
        here he was married and at that point, there wasn\u2019t birth control--they
        were Catholic, you know--it was baby after baby and so he had to get a job.
        And when he came back to Minnesota, it just seems impossible when you think
        about it. He got a job, if you can imagine, initially working for a framer.
        Can you imagine anybody making a living, supporting children working for a
        framer nowadays? And then he eventually got a job with Economic Labs, and
        he was probably there for about ten years I\u2019d say, somewhere in his mid-thirties--he
        said by that time, I think they were done having children, and she started
        getting part-time jobs and so he decided to devote himself. In that time,
        he was restoring and renovating and fixing up this place A Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n6\nand building his studio. And
        whenever he had extra money everything went back into making this place livable
        and he would do it in a variety of ways: he would he hire a bulldozer to come
        in at fifty dollars an hour, he said, and just bury everything, all the garbage,
        and sculpt the land. Then he started planting trees and then he mucked out
        the barn and started building his studio in the barn and putting on a show
        room, and once he finished that, he started it\u2014because for over twenty-five
        years he taught twelve students twice a week, and during that time in the
        early years he worked as a ceramics instructor for several years--\nAW: He
        worked at the University?\nEA: Not at the University, the other one, you know
        the big art school connected with the school of Minneapolis Institute of Art?
        There\u2019s this school there, MCAD. Anyway, he worked there for several
        years. He was working there, he was teaching there. Basically it was always
        in his mind to work on his own. He felt that if he affiliated himself with
        a university, that what happens when you do that is it becomes less about
        what your work represents and more about the teaching, and it was very important
        for him to just work on his craft and although he did have to teach\u2014he
        did teach students and he had some students for over twenty years that would
        come here and work with him. Nobody ever worked for him. He would have a variety
        over the years of young people that would come in here and want to be an assistant.
        But the problem at that point was he worked there by himself and they would
        always want him to pay them and he would always say, \u201cThat\u2019s not
        the way it works,\u201d and he couldn\u2019t afford to do that.\nAnd early
        on he got involved with communities. I don''t know when the Minnesota Crafts
        Council was established, but he was early on involved with them. He was involved
        in the very beginning of the Uptown Art Show. He was involved with shows up
        and down the river. When I met him there was a group of us that were getting
        together, it was the Marine Art Guild [Marine on St. Croix]: it was a range
        of professionals and nonprofessionals, and we wanted to establish the Marine
        Art Fair. But as the Marine Art Guild we always felt that we needed some gravitas
        and so we wanted to get Rich involved. We asked him to be a part of it and
        he was not interested in the art guild, but he was interested in establishing
        a Marine art show. So for a while there we did it twice a year and at the
        time, before we were married, he never had shows here but he had an open studio,
        and the studio and the showroom were always open, people could always come
        out here. He used to jokingly say, \u201cIf it had been up to the people of
        Stillwater and Marine, I would''ve starved to death a long time ago.\u201d
        People from Minneapolis and in the Cities came out here to buy his stuff.
        He had a variety of shows. He had shows at the MIA, he had shows at the Walker,
        he was an established potter, and was getting a lot of recognition.\n00:29:00\nAW:
        And when did you guys get married?\nEA: We got married in 1981. Of course
        there was never a question of where we were going to live or how we were going
        to do this because he had a business, so I moved in and soon I was very influenced
        by this extremely disciplined guy who got up every morning and said, \u201cThis
        is what you do: you go out and you go up to the studio.\u201d So I did the
        same. I would get up when the kids would go off to school and we would both
        go to the studio. In twenty-five years, he came up A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n7\nor I went down to look at what he
        was working on or what I was working on. He would always come in and sit down
        and look, and I would set my paintings up and we would discuss and he would
        critique and we would discuss that, and then when I would go down; it was
        the same thing and there were just rituals that went on for years and years
        and years and then we met here for lunch and again it was always discussing
        what I was working on, what he was working on, and in that time our work was
        changing. I mean, he had people who collected his things for years, and he
        went from pretty dark, earthy, black, dark glazes and they got lighter and
        lighter and lighter; and little floral designs somehow crept in and what have
        you. People would go, \u201cAh, something\u2019s having an influence on you
        there,\u201d and it was always kind of a grinning thing.\nAnother wonderful
        thing that was a part of our ritual was when he was firing\u2014and I never
        went out there when he opened the kiln\u2014I stayed in the house, made a
        pot of coffee, and waited. It was what he preferred to do and I knew that.
        So if it was a beautiful firing he would start walking over to the house with
        pots in his arms and lay them out all over and say, \u201cLook at this, look
        at these glazes, look at this.\u201d He and I would just go crazy together
        over the pots. If time went by and nobody was coming out--I mean, [if] he
        wasn\u2019t coming--then I knew I had to go over there to see what went wrong,
        but that wasn''t that often. For all the years, even when he was sick, for
        all the years of our marriage I never did a painting without him looking at
        it or giving his critique and vice versa. We were very involved in that way,
        and felt very fortunate. I mean people would often say, \u201cWell, two artists?
        That must be fiery.\u201d But no, nothing further from it\u2014it was very
        simpatico.\nIn that time, as far as our involvement with community, Rich always
        would do demonstrations for local groups or work within the grade schools
        where his children went to school. He never went over to universities; he
        never did things like that. But he did do a lot of work in terms of demonstrating
        with the children up in Marine\u2019s school and various groups who would
        call him and ask for demonstrations. He was wonderful that way. Groups of
        people would come from the Walker or whatever to visit his pottery and he
        would do demos, and a lot of that went on, always, so his involvement in terms
        of that community. When we were married we started doing shows here at least
        twice a year and then there were several shows. He did the Uptown, we did
        the Marine Art Fair, we did Afton\u2014we started the Afton\u2014we started
        the Stillwater Art Fair, we did Hudson\u2014there [were] just numerous [shows].
        But he didn''t travel; some potters travel all over the country. The thing
        is when Rich was young he got rheumatic fever\u2014his father and two uncles
        had died before they were fifty-five of rheumatic fever; there wasn\u2019t
        antibiotics. So he was in high school, he was about seventeen years old, when
        he got severe rheumatic fever that damaged his heart. And at that time nothing
        was ever diagnosed, you didn\u2019t diagnose things back then, but he spent
        a year in bed. So there were health issues early on; certainly by the time
        he was sixty, he was being diagnosed at that point that there was heart problems.
        So he wasn''t going to start traveling all over the country; he was going
        to do the focus of his craft here.\nBut the other thing that he did was the
        property itself. The buildings never were static, the gardens were never static;
        we had huge gardens, the flowerbeds changed, he was digging up, putting in,
        putting in walkways, constantly reworking this piece of property. When I married
        him it was fifteen acres. When he bought it it was a hundred acres but after
        the divorce he sold off eighty or some acres, but it was always changing;
        he did ninety percent of it by himself.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n8\n00:35:35\nAW: Did he reflect on why he did that?\nEA:
        Never. I think there were a lot of reasons, probably, looking back at the
        time. He would always say, \u201cI''m not that deep.\u201d Well that was so
        not true, because he could not hardly stand to go into a place like Perkins.
        There was not a restaurant, building, anything that he didn''t walk into and
        wasn''t doing a running commentary on their obnoxious aesthetics and how nobody
        had any aesthetics.\nAnother thing that was very important in his pottery
        career was he became involved with designers. Then there was a couple of design
        companies that he worked for that were designers out of Minneapolis, and one
        had a pottery business and they also sold clay and he would make objects for
        that. But the other guy did huge jobs for churches and Rich was just about
        the only potter in the country that he worked architecturally with\u2014the
        guy that owned the catalog was Grant Gilderhus\u2014and the other guy, he
        was an architectural designer, so he designed baptismal founts and even alters
        and the work that would go in them. Rich worked with the designer, would walk
        into churches and talk about alters and he would do large crucifixes and massive
        baptismal\u2014St. John''s Abbey has his work\u2014and he would do whole communion
        sets and one of the things that he did was he would do individual communion
        cups, maybe four hundred. He would be called from all over the world. He did
        communion ware for Africa; everywhere they called and he would do them. He
        also would sometimes work for\u2014if people wanted tiles, he would make art
        tiles but not a lot of that. I think in the Uptown area that building, I don\u2019t
        know what it\u2019s called, but it still has some of his ceramics that was
        done specifically for a restaurant. But he did a lot of that stuff and he
        was very well known for his large work in churches.\n00:39:00\nAW: Speaking
        of that work, you said he grew up in a very strong Catholic household. Did
        he ever reflect on religion as influencing his approach to his work?\nEA:
        When we were married we were not\u2014there was first of all, as a result
        of the divorce and the changes that were going on in the church, he wasn\u2019t\u2014Rich
        was a spiritual man, but he wasn\u2019t religious by any means. We didn''t
        go to church. Both of us had Catholic backgrounds and both of us were appalled
        at the rules of the church with divorce, barring divorce\u2014it was just
        stupid. So subsequently did his religion have an influence on his art? No.
        He knew historically\u2014he was a great reader of history\u2014he knew the
        importance of church and art and that the Renaissance in many regards, you
        know, the preservation of art as a result of what the church fathers did was
        important or their benefacting influence in that regard. But no, it didn''t
        have any influence on him. But he had a deep regard aesthetically just for
        nature, but he was a pragmatist too; it was interesting, he was an interesting
        man. He loved literature, he loved history, and he never considered what he
        did as influencing and important in society; he did what he did because it
        was his process. He didn''t have an inflated idea about who he was in the
        world at all, which was interesting because he did influence people, but he
        never thought in terms of that, \u201cI have to do this because this is going
        to be a legacy for somebody.\u201d In fact, his ashes are in an urn the next
        room; he''s shuddering in there that I''m still here, he wanted me out of
        here, he didn''t want me to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n9\ncontinue
        any kind of legacy because this was our retirement, we were both artists essentially.
        I worked part-time as a nurse, but this was how we made our living and so
        I don''t have largesse to keep it going.\nIn terms of the pottery community,
        he was very aware\u2014the Ceramics Monthly was very critical, and he was
        very aware, plus he had a mind like a steel trap so he remembered. There would
        be sales, and there was not one customer that ever came into that pottery\u2014and
        he had a lot of people that bought a lot of stuff\u2014that he didn''t know
        when they purchased, what they purchased, and what they paid for it. He knew
        that sort of thing; it was always amazing for me. They would say, \u201cDo
        you remember back in \u201978 when I bought--,\u201d \u201cOh, yeah, you bought
        that blah-blah-blah and you paid whatever for it.\u201d So if they came in
        and said, \u201cWell I paid this for it,\u201d he knew exactly what they paid
        for it and they couldn\u2019t argue with him.\nAW: That\u2019s a question,
        if his kids took up pottery or his grandkids have taken up ceramics?\nEA:
        You know what? He didn''t encourage it. [Pulls out photographs] This is the
        opening showroom, and what you can see in here is the tons of work. No, he
        didn\u2019t encourage it, although he has a son that\u2019s an architect who
        lives in Brussels and who has been there for twenty years now: Greg, who is
        fifty-three.\nAW: Is he the oldest?\nEA: Yes, there\u2019s Greg. Julie, who
        is a registered nurse and lives here in Minneapolis and an up-and-coming photographer,
        but she works as a nurse but she has great astute eye. Her last name is Abnet.
        Julie Abnet, Greg Abnet, and then Kevin Abnet, and he''s a doctor and he\u2019s
        a surgeon and an anesthesiologist, lives in Burlington, Vermont. Then there''s
        Christian Abnet who is a scientist who has worked for the NIH now fourteen
        years and branch manager, basically, at the National Institute of Health.
        So he''s got two sons, one with a PhD, one a doctor. Julie is a degreed nurse
        from the University [of Minnesota]. Except for Christian, who went to the
        University of Oregon at Portland, they all went to the University of Minnesota.
        In fact, when Rich died I got a letter from the then president of the University,
        because Rich had been alumni. They all have deep aesthetic taste, but he didn''t
        encourage anybody to become an artist because he thought it was too hard,
        and his wife''s father was a doctor and had been the head of the Department
        of Family Health or something at the University hospitals and that was kind
        of encouraged more, to go into the sciences, and they all had good math aptitudes.\nWhat
        was interesting is that he had more of an influence on my children who were
        seven, ten and twelve when we got married. My daughter has a degree in art
        and has continued and worked as an art teacher out in California and has continued
        to take and took pottery at the University and has continued to take pottery
        and often talks that, \u201cI can feel dad there with me.\u201d She talks
        very strongly about how it had been years since she was throwing and she was
        on the wheel and finally something clicked and she had this overwhelming feeling
        that Rich was right there with her, guiding her. She also has a direct line
        to eBay so that if anything of his goes for sale, they immediately contact
        Jenny. She is buying up his stuff left and right. So is my daughter Megan,
        who\u2019s an English teacher, and then my son Christopher, who is a family
        therapist. All these kids love art and art was incredibly important to them,
        and even when they were young the idea of my A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n10\npainting they always would say, \u201cAre you selling?
        Are you painting? What are you working on now, Mom?\u201d It\u2019s what they
        grew up in; they grew up and art discussion was just part of the family.\nWhat
        was interesting about Christopher is that the very first pottery tour show,
        twenty-two or twenty-three years ago\u2014we went out West. We had bought
        a Ford Explorer and I had never seen mountains; we had just worked, always.
        We would only go away for extended weekends. So this was the first big vacation
        we ever took. We left Chris here because Rich didn''t think it would end up
        being anything. At some point, I think it was Utah, we called to see how it
        was going and Christopher went, \u201cMy God, they come in buses. This is
        horrible!\u201d He was alone handling that all by himself with all these people
        coming. Rich was just stunned at how even then, people showed up, people just
        came, for the Pottery Tour.\n00:49:25\nAW: Can you tell us how he got involved
        with The Tour?\nEA: Bob Briscoe told me this; he certainly knew who these
        people were. I think as far as I would know, I don''t think this group of
        potters were hanging out together; they were pretty much individuals doing
        their own things, except I do know that Linda is deeply involved and she''s
        always over the years gotten grants and done workshops in the summer, done
        a lot of things like that, you know, traveled and taught, and so she''s very
        involved in that as a woman and a woman of a certain age, you know, very influenced
        and important in that regard. I think Jeff also did a lot of traveling and
        grant getting. Now I''m not sure how much Bob did that, and Bob has been very
        generous in his compliments about how much he was influenced by Rich and the
        fact that Rich just set up his thing and did his craft and that''s what was
        important. The others\u2014Connee Mayeron is a different level and I think
        mainly because to me\u2014it\u2019s sort of like when I wanted to find women
        who influenced me as a young painter and an artist I looked for women that
        had children and were married, you know, and not necessarily the marriage
        end of it, but the mother end of it. I wanted to know how those women balanced
        their lives and how they managed to do that and over the years I would have
        young women that would graduate and come and say, \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d
        Well, I don''t know how you do it; you just do it one day at a time. I did
        it because it was a generational thing. It''s a totally different generation
        of my daughters--but they are in their forties--it''s a totally different
        thing of women in their twenties and thirties, and yet some things change
        and other things stay the same and it takes a long time. So Connie, I think,
        I always felt that she was fortunate enough to have money behind her so she
        never had to worry about, \u201cHow am I going to pay for this project,\u201d
        or whatever.\nEvery artist has to figure out how to make art work, what are
        they going to do to sustain their muse, their dream, and their business\u2014to
        put food on the table and pay the utility bills, more or less. As a practical
        farmer coming out of the Depression, Rich, as a practical man who had seen
        firsthand what happens when things fail, he was going to do his utmost to
        make things work and he didn''t want to align himself with universities because
        he just thought there was just too much politics going on; that wasn''t what
        he wanted to do. What''s interesting is he didn''t have that kind of academic
        outlook, but at the same time he was very much academic because he''s so respected
        and he always talked about Asian pottery. It was always interesting to him
        that this whole A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n11\nmovement
        of potters that started to make pots spontaneously, to mimic the Korean craftsman
        that would do these spontaneous fresh little bowls that were like quick pencil
        sketches, they were so fresh and important. Somebody had once said, \u201cYou\u2019re
        digging up these graves and everyone thinks these are great vessels in these
        tombs.\u201d Well, maybe they\u2019re in the tombs because they were the crappy
        ones. Anyway, what was important for him was refinement and his work was very
        refined: in uniform and beautiful, and there was a lot of criticism because
        it was too perfect and was too refined. And so as the movement in pottery
        went more towards things more spontaneous, I think that he was never quite
        understood because that wasn\u2019t what he was about; he was about something
        much more refined. When he started painting, because his shoulders were just
        gone, when he started painting, he was so meticulous and such a detail person
        and it would make me crazy because I was not that way. And I thought, \u201cJust
        go in there and throw some paint on that canvas,\u201d and he never could
        approach it that way.\nHow did he get in [the Tour]? I can''t speak to that.
        I just know that they called him. I think it was Bob. He was also close to
        Will Swanson, but I don''t know. I think it was Bob who called him and said,
        \u201cThis is what we have in mind, would you come up and sit in on our meetings?\u201d
        So he went up as the senior statesman, what have you, to be a part of it and
        give his opinion and see how it went, and he was pleasantly surprised, I mean,
        he just really was. Although when we did shows here people showed up always,
        tons of people. We did shows in the fall and in the spring and sometimes we
        did three shows and people always came and bought. And still today people
        come and say, \u201cOh, I have his pots. I eat out of that cereal bowl every
        day and I love it.\u201d That never turned his head; he never thought of it
        in terms of that it was because of him. It was just that he did a job well
        done, that\u2019s just the way he looked at it.\n00:57:30\nAW: On that note
        and getting back to some of his early experiences here. So had he taken a
        class in ceramics before Warren MacKenzie\u2019s class or that was the very
        first time he had any experience with ceramics?\nEA: No, he wanted architecture.\nAW:
        Did he reflect on that class? What did he say about meeting Warren? You said
        he really was changed by that class; any more specifics around what was it
        about Warren\u2019s teaching?\nEA: Warren also had an aesthetic that he admired
        and I think that it all collates with this being the son of a farmer, living
        close to the land, and the idea of working for yourself and making a craft
        was just completely what did it. He wasn\u2019t ever a follower, and he talked
        about that and I''m sure in the class he didn''t speak\u2014I mean, he and
        Warren knew each other. Over the years, Warren has had students that he''s
        been closely aligned with, but Rich wasn\u2019t going to be closely aligned
        with anybody. Rich was his own person and he was going to go off and he was
        interested in doing his thing. He respected, again, the discipline and what
        Warren always taught about the beautiful pots that were being designed to
        be used and to be made and to be functional in a home and that whole movement,
        influenced by Bernard Leach, where Warren had worked, that whole philosophy
        was very important to Rich and not far from the whole idea of being an architect:
        working, doing something that influences how a person lives, perhaps. But
        I don''t know, he A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n12\nwould
        talk about it better than I am talking about it, which I feel bad about; too
        bad he''s not here. I feel bad because I''m doing it in such a limited level.\nAW:
        I wanted to follow up: so when Rich was in the Marines and then came back
        and decided to pursue school and then took the ceramics class, what was his
        degree in from the University of Minnesota?\nEA: His degree would''ve been
        in Art as a BA, it might have been a BS.\nAW: So that\u2019s what he finished
        with at the University of Minnesota and then he went to Rochester. What did
        he talk about what his parents thought of any of this? What was that like?\nEA:
        Not good. This was the early Sixties, they were appalled, and when he bought
        this place they were appalled. The tragedy though was this was twenty-six,
        twenty-seven, twenty-eight, and his father died of heart disease at fifty-four
        and a disease from rheumatic fever that would eventually take Rich\u2019s
        life. They would come down here and they could never\u2014even his brothers\u2014they
        would come and say, \u201cWell, how is the pottery going?\u201d These weren\u2019t
        uneducated people. In one year three brothers died all together and a son-in-law
        so Charlie had died first and then Greg and then Rich and then Stewart so
        within a very short time four men of that family have died. Except Charlie,
        who did not have rheumatic fever, Rich and Greg both had rheumatic fever;
        it was cancer that killed the other two brothers, actually three brothers.
        So they all respected but they didn''t understand, and I get that completely,
        I get that completely. When I graduated from high school I wanted to go to
        the Minneapolis Institute of Art and I was roundly told by my parents, \u201cWe
        are not having any beatnik in our family.\u201d A beatnik, really? It was
        so discouraged. You will do something practical because, who cares?, you\u2019re
        only going to get married and have kids anyway. It would be worse now but
        back then you expected it almost.\nYou weren\u2019t being supported but you
        didn\u2019t know a whole lot of women that were being supported. Most of your
        high school friends\u2014some were going off to college but most of them who
        would never finish would get married and have babies. Or if they did, you
        have to remember, it was only a few degrees open that were really practical.
        Women became teachers, they became nurses, and they became secretaries. You
        didn''t know a whole lot of women that would individually go off and become
        doctors; you had to have a very unusual family that would support you in doing
        that. And then if you are in any of those areas and you got pregnant, God
        forbid, or were married and got pregnant, you had to quit work because you
        could not work pregnant. I just retired from nursing. I was a licensed practical
        nurse because I said, \u201cI''m not going to become an RN because I am going
        to work my way through art school, with just this minor degree.\u201d\nActually
        I\u2019m glad I got that degree because it sustained us as far as health insurance.
        Many artists we knew never had health insurance, which we were very fortunate
        to have; we were happy about that. I only worked part time but it also gave
        me a broader sense, you know, you don''t get too wrapped up about what is
        working and what isn\u2019t working. At any rate, it was years before anybody
        knew I was an artist and then it was like, \u201cOh, you paint? My grandma
        paints.\u201d You just didn\u2019t go there. These were different things.
        And then by the time I left young nurses or young women would come up and
        say, \u201cI saw your stuff at a gallery around town, you really are an A
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n13\nartist aren\u2019t
        you?\u201d The thing is with other artists I can discuss it, but unless you
        really go live in the warehouse district and are working and living in a community
        of artists like that you just don''t go talking about it because I was of
        the generation that when my parents first went to shows that I was having\u2014now
        his mother painted and was a poet and his father was a lawyer and there were
        doctors and lawyers so these weren''t uneducated people. They were all, way
        back then, very educated. And I said, \u201cWell gee, Dad, you didn\u2019t
        say anything about the artwork?\u201d He said, \u201cWhy? You know it''s good.
        I\u2019m not going to give you a bigger head than you already have.\u201d
        I say this because Rich understood that implicitly. What''s interesting about
        it\u2014and this probably had a lot to do with the greater influences in terms
        of his first marriage\u2014his children barely asked him and barely talked
        about art with him. I think that had a lot to do with his first wife. But
        it was my kids, particularly my daughters, that really respected and they
        all do, you know, now, in hindsight, but he didn\u2019t over talk about that.
        We\u2019d talk about it here and there but it''s sort of like, it''s the process:
        don''t worry about whether it\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s the process that''s
        important; you do it because you need to.\n01:08:30\nAW: It really sounds
        like a lot of social pressure at that time, family pressure to not go into
        this field. So for both of you to have pursued this is as you did is really
        incredible.\nEA: But even today I will have family members or friends who
        will talk about children with creative, or deeply creative leanings, and they
        kind of go \u201cEww,\u201d like it''s a disease\u2014not a lot of people,
        but still, you don''t meet a lot of people that want their kids to become
        artists. The first thing you\u2019re going to say is, \u201cHow are you going
        to make a living?\u201d You can\u2019t even make a living now barely as a
        historian. When Christian, who is forty-seven, got his PhD he immediately
        went back, he got a degree in biology. Even back then there was not a lot
        of stuff going around, jobs, so they said, \u201cDon''t get a Master\u2019s
        degree, that''s not going to get you anywhere. You have to have a PhD.\u201d
        So then his wife, I love Rebecca''s degree, she has a PhD in feminism and
        literature with a leaning in science fiction. So I go with her to Madison
        to WizCon. Anyway, I\u2019ve learned a lot by Rebecca. But were there jobs?
        Well, she could become an English professor but they had children and she
        devoted herself those first ten years to those kids; then you have to bide
        your time and do stuff on the side because you become nervous as a woman thinking,
        \u201cWell, ok, I\u2019ve got to keep a foot in the door,\u201d because you
        become irrelevant. I\u2019ve worked with young women all my life of course
        in medicine and I work with, have worked with, very young women coming out
        being obstetricians because I worked in OB. Then after about five years they
        want to have kids and they go, \u201cWhy did I go into this business?\u201d
        Because basically as advanced as we are, you\u2019re still doing the majority
        of what\u2019s at home, they\u2019ve proven that with statistics, you\u2019re
        still earning the money, making the meals.\nAW: I think that\u2019s really
        important because that\u2019s come up in our other interviews with Linda and
        Connee\u2014the kinds of challenges they faced not only as potters striking
        out trying to make a career with pottery but as women potters trying to have
        that all happen. I think it\u2019s good to talk about that and also talk about
        the continuing issues we\u2019re facing.\nEA: I\u2019ve read things over the
        years and it\u2019s pretty interesting\u2014I remember reading, in fact, an
        interview with Ursula Le Guin, who is a writer of science fiction, one of
        the first. WizCon is A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n14\ninteresting
        to go to because it is heavily feminist. What you go and find is that especially
        within the science fiction genre, there are so few women and they are being
        fought against by the men, who have dominated science fiction, and now minorities,
        you know, black women and black men trying to break into and be relevant in
        the science fiction genre. It\u2019s so fascinating. Ursula Le Guin, in these
        interviews said, \u201cHistorically, artists,\u201d\u2014she was talking about
        writers but it could be across the board, any kind of artist\u2014\u201cMen
        or women: the women would put their heads in ovens if they ended up with children,
        like Sylvia Plath, or the most successful men or women eschewed children,
        or stable relationships. They just didn\u2019t because you couldn\u2019t.
        You could barely, barely do it.\u201d\nFor my own art, it\u2019s been hard
        enough to paint since Rich died, since my muse died, and the man that was
        the only person I ever met that said, \u201cYou are an artist, you can do
        this, do it.\u201d When I quit working as a nurse because it was a discipline
        like all right, \u201cI''m working these days so this day I\u2019ve got to
        be in the studio.\u201d My art always took a backseat, always, a backseat
        to everything, the house, the kids, and I just knew that that''s what it was.
        If you get crazy and angry you\u2019re never going to do anything. You have
        to just do what you can do because if it isn\u2019t those things it will be
        something else. It can be health; health can kill you. Life is going to throw
        you curves. Rather than sitting around worrying about it, you just don\u2019t
        know. Life threw Rich curves and he would still go out in that studio. And
        then to make himself energized he went in his yard or into the house and built.
        In the wintertime I used to say I would go to work or go up to the studio
        because it would be so cold sometimes in the barn he couldn\u2019t work. He
        wouldn''t teach through January and February; he\u2019d start teaching again
        in March and he would start creating again because when it was really bitter,
        firing the kiln was not practical so he wouldn''t fire. He would have a month
        or so when he would take off and so then he would come into the house and
        start cleaning out cupboards and cooking and cleaning. I was like, Wow, I\u2019m
        so lucky. And I worked with women at the hospital who said, \u201cOh I hate
        it when so-and-so gets in to my kitchen.\u201d Really? Not me. Anyway--\n01:16:15\nAW:
        We were talking about his family\u2019s response. So his father died pretty
        young, and his mother?\nEA: His mother lived to be in her 90s.\nAW: So she
        saw his career progress?\nEA: Yes she did. How he turned this place around,
        she saw that. I remember once when we were first married and of course he
        was very private, nobody knew circumstances. His sister has about forty degrees
        and was a very singularly independent woman, really different, lived out in
        California, always worked as much as she could. She was always getting a degree
        in this or that, and she was a fanatic birder. She came here once with her
        mother and they were looking around at all the stuff and it was sort of funny,
        his mother said, \u201cLook at this man: is there anything he can\u2019t do?\u201d
        And I said, \u201cWell yes, as a matter of fact he can''t hold a tune and
        he can''t dance.\u201d They just looked at me; they didn''t think it was even
        funny. Certainly by the time\u2014they all bought his pottery, admired his
        pottery; he would always give deals and all the children had a set A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n15\nof dishes. In fact,
        when he started getting sick, that was one of the things that Bob Briscoe
        and I worked on because when he died unfortunately there was over three hundred
        pieces of unfinished pottery in the barn and most of it had been formed on
        the slab roller, because he couldn\u2019t throw anymore because his shoulders
        were so gone. He had had numerous shoulder surgeries, worn-out rotator cuffs,
        so he couldn\u2019t throw basically because there was nothing left.\nHe was
        making things with slabs and forming and he had three sets of dishes out there.
        After he died I kept trying to get somebody to help me bisque fire it, and
        then I finally started bisque firing on my own, not in any gas kiln, but in
        the electrical kiln. Slowly with help from\u2014actually the summer after
        he died, I had this potter from Iowa come up, and did a workshop here through
        the science museum\u2014it was wonderful. Then Linda would come down, Bob
        would come down and Will would come down, but these are busy people and they
        couldn''t do it. Finally Bob said, \u201cEdie, just bring it up. We\u2019ll
        do it.\u201d I didn''t care if it was his glazes I just wanted it done. I
        needed to settle for these kids getting their dishes. So I got a friend who
        had a van and we put all eighteen massive containers of his glazes and all
        the pottery, hauled it up to Bob''s, and in one afternoon Julie, myself, my
        friend Dave and Bob and basically it was just three of us, but we glazed all
        of it. Then it was going to be a huge snowstorm. They went back because they
        had to work and so I stayed up there and went there early morning to help
        Bob load the kiln, and we started it up. Two days later I went back up there
        with Dave, we put all the glazing back in and all the finished pottery, so
        we opened up [the kiln], and I have pictures from that.\nSo, me and Bob, we
        just got it done, and Bob was very involved in this very seminal, important
        thing and he was a very generous man and we were all happy that this got finished.
        There\u2019s still stuff out there that I was going to do this June that haven\u2019t
        been finished but I have a show now at the Stillwater Library, and because
        they\u2019re mainly big art pieces, I don''t know what I want to do with them.
        They\u2019re big pieces and raw bisqued and they\u2019re so sculptural, I
        don\u2019t know. Some of them are down at the show in the library.\n01:21:35\nAW:
        Wow that''s really an incredible story to get the last pots all glazed. Those
        were ones for his family or for the kids?\nEA: For the kids, right. It was
        a huge deal; in fact, there was this young man who was a filmmaker. He\u2019s
        a teacher and getting his PhD; he does the Square Lake Film Festival; he\u2019s
        done it for 10 years. He was going to do a film on it because he remembers
        coming here as a child because his parents bought a lot of Rich\u2019s work
        and going into the showroom and the kiln was firing and he, [Paul], said he
        said he must''ve been six or seven--it was such a vivid memory--that Rich
        pulled out a piece of what was called a glory hole and so this firebrick that
        you can handle that it''s like foam, but the one end was like burning ember
        but it doesn''t transmit the firebrick and he showed him. [Paul] remembers
        how it never left his mind that you could hold that brick in that fire and
        the expression in his eyes, that twinkle in his eyes. I feel bad that I didn''t
        pursue it more with him, because he did want to do a film of finishing those
        pots, and I didn\u2019t pursue that as much as I should have.\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n16\nAW: Well, a busy time
        and a tough time it sounds like right after he had passed, so it must have
        been a really tough time to be doing all of this stuff. But speaking of this
        young guy, you said his parents brought him here. Who came to the studio early
        on in his career? Who was the audience for Richard\u2019s work? Where were
        they from? How did he build up an audience over time?\nEA: They were from
        the Cities. He did a lot of shows and he sold a lot of his work in Minneapolis
        and he worked as an instructor at MCAD. He did shows in small galleries all
        around town at that time and he was just recognized as a good potter. He was
        always recognized as a gifted potter, always.\n01:25:00\nEA: Paul Creager
        is the filmmaker. Paul Creager, remember that name and you\u2019ll see he\u2019ll
        go far. He is an independent filmmaker and he works closely with film in Minnesota
        and he is the man that is establishing the Square Lake Film Festival, which
        has been going on for two years, and he''s such an interesting young man.
        Now he and some other people have taken over the Lumberjack Days in Stillwater.
        I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it but this guy that was running
        it started absconding with the money, wasn''t paying bills, and might go to
        jail. So they didn''t do it for a number of years and they wanted to do it
        again, the Chamber of Commerce, and so they had people make presentations.
        Three people made presentations, and two of the people, two of the companies,
        were turning this festival, Lumberjack Days that had been a small community
        thing. It was wonderful; there were a lot of small community activities going
        on and it turned into some big biker, big-name Rockfest stuff that nobody
        who lived in town wanted to go to town because of this stuff. So Paul and
        some other local people said, \u201cWe want to do it and we want to bring
        it back to its roots,\u201d and it is going back to its roots; another wonderful
        history thing. When I''ve have had fundraisers for ArtReach Alliance, which
        is run by Heather Rutledge, ArtReach Alliance is a very community-based art
        organization that is important in terms of how the community of artists throughout
        the Valley, which interestingly, you know, when Rich was alive we just did
        our thing and raised our kids. We were in the community but it wasn''t the
        focus to drag the community into the awareness of how important art as part
        of life should be. But since he has died it''s because of Heather and Paul
        and Guillermo and I was involved with the pottery tour this year because I
        had people staying at my house. In fact now since he died I always wanted
        to get a potter back in here and it never worked out. Now a young potter is
        coming who\u2019s worked up in Two Harbors\u2014it''s just trying to figure
        out how I can open the pottery again, I don''t know how I\u2019m going to
        do that.\nAW: It\u2019s an amazing thing to try for.\nEA: I really want to
        do it but the logistics of that. This is the problem: where is he going to
        live? Do I open up the house and say, Yeah, you can live with me? The thing
        is I''ve been alone for a while, do I want that? And then it gets back to,
        well, a lot of people would do it. Linda would probably do it. Here I am,
        I do want the pottery open. It''s like trying to be a farmer nowadays: they
        have to have a place to live, they have to have another job, and they can''t
        come from the Cities and do that economically, it just isn\u2019t going to
        work. So where would he live? How are we going to work this out? I don\u2019t
        know. I would like it to work but I don''t want this young man to A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n17\ncome here, he\u2019s
        twenty-six, and not be aware that maybe in six months I might go, \u201cEh,
        this isn\u2019t going to work, you can\u2019t be here, this is not going to
        work.\u201d That''s not fair, so I don''t know.\n01:30:26\nAW: Well maybe
        a trial run of some kind, just to figure out if this is going to work. It
        is a big commitment particularly what you were saying about sharing the studio
        with Richard and how that space is really meaningful to you. And you continue
        to paint in the studio?\nEA: He built a studio for me; I\u2019m up above and
        he was down below. I don''t care about having someone in here; I don''t want
        to make it a mausoleum to Rich. I want it to function; the only way that barn
        is going to stand up is if it keeps activity in it. When activity goes in
        there, when Sally did that workshop in there, it was wonderful. Just last
        week I had the kids in there, a couple of my grandkids, we were making slab
        pots. It needs to be somebody working in there. It''s the rest of that, how
        to make that work. It''s pretty basic out there, there''s no running water,
        Rich hauled water; there\u2019s a rain barrel with water and they\u2019d have
        to come use the toilet in here. None of that bothers me but it is not like
        he can be out there and there''s a toilet; it''s got a furnace, it\u2019s
        heated. But he sounds just thrilled with it, but he still needs a place to
        live and he probably needs a part-time job, besides trying to make pots.\nAW:
        Have you thought about looking into the art grants around, or has he thought
        about looking at grants to see if you could maybe get something?\nEA: Well
        no, we haven\u2019t. But at the most it would be $10,000 for, how long is
        that going to last? There could be, there could be some options, right.\nAW:
        You\u2019re in an interesting time here where you\u2019re trying to figure
        out what\u2019s happening next.\nEA: The first three years I had a young pottery
        couple that was going to do it, but then she got a job as a curator out in
        Arizona so they went out there, and another young man came along, and then
        none of it ever panned out. I\u2019ve even had women sort of like Joan Mondale,
        women who liked to make pots, but they want to come down to places like Northern
        Clay, they don\u2019t want to come all the way out here, and they don''t like
        the idea of no running water back there.\nAW: I''m sure something will get
        figured out; this is too beautiful a place for the barn to be empty.\nEA:
        Well actually there''s a couple of thing that I sort of backed away from,
        I didn''t want to do, but now I have another woman coming on Friday\u2014so
        funny after three years, and I think it''s become more critical because I
        don''t work anymore and I don''t have that basis of income\u2014who is a wedding
        planner, because people want to get married in spots like this.\nAW: What
        do you think Richard would think about that?\nEA: You know what, in the few
        months before he died, he just wanted to say, \u201cWhat are you doing here?
        What are you going to do?\u201d because we hadn\u2019t gotten out of here,
        he got too sick. I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n18\nwas
        very emphatic about how I was going to be okay, that I was going to turn this
        into a business that it was going to be okay. And he was like, \u201cAhh,
        get out of here.\u201d But he just got sick too fast so we couldn\u2019t get
        out of here. Plus I really believed that the move would just kill him. So
        we didn\u2019t leave and here I am, but we never thought of being here forever\u2014this
        was like a farm; it was to be sold and this was retirement income. The thing
        is that these size properties are not selling well. Home sales are not really
        great yet. There are six homes for sale just in Marine not even half this
        size. He said don''t give it away, well there''s a lot to\u2014I have a leaking
        roof, too.\n01:35:50\nAW: You were saying a little bit earlier, initially
        he wasn''t really as involved in the community or didn\u2019t seek it out.\nEW:
        We started art fairs, he worked in schools, and he would do workshops in schools
        when they called. There used to be a lot of state money for that, artists
        in residence programs in grade school\u2014I did a lot of through that the
        museum in St. Paul. There was money for artists to go into schools and teach
        for an hour so that they would get art credits and that was really big in
        the 1990s and in the 1980s. But then it all went away, and there used to be
        another thing that really hurt the art community was that corporations used
        to get tax credits, and so did artists, for artwork and you could get tax
        credits as an artist for art you sold. Now they only give you credit for material.
        So they screwed every which way they could, and so it\u2019s wonderful that
        there is now this legacy grant for that.\nAW: But I\u2019m curious about the
        community\u2019s response to Richard\u2019s work?\nEA: They loved it, and
        over time they definitely did. He was wonderfully charming and was a great
        demonstrator, but I would freely go up to schools, and this was interesting,
        he wasn\u2019t terribly hardnosed about it. This is what bugged him, that
        the schools needed the artist just to come in but they didn''t pay you anything,
        they wanted you to just do it. I always did it where my kids went to school,
        and I did it in other places. They might give you some money but basically
        they didn''t, and he didn''t like that.\nAW: Tell us a little bit more about
        the Tour over the years, like how the first year you said you headed out west
        and your son Christopher was here and had to manage it. What happened the
        next couple of years?\nEW: He would go to all the meetings and become involved.
        As it developed there was\u2014as time went on there was a relationship of
        camaraderie developing that meant a lot to him, that meant a great deal to
        him. He really started to develop it with Will Swanson and he really liked
        these people. It meant a lot to him. Then, of course, I think the last ten
        years of his life, he had been part of the pottery tour for twelve years and
        I want to think that it might''ve been 2005 maybe; he went to 2005 or 2006.
        I can''t remember. He was getting sick and I think inside he knew he was dying,
        he was a dying man, and he said, \u201cThis is what I want to do. This is
        not what I want to do,\u201d and he had just decided. First of all he couldn\u2019t
        throw, and what\u2019s interesting about all that is that he had an incredible
        pain threshold, so he never said, \u201cIt kills me to throw.\u201d He never
        would say those things, he would just say, \u201cI just can\u2019t do this
        anymore,\u201d so you knew he was in A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n19\npain. It really moved him when he had to announce to
        people after one year, after one of his pottery tours, that it was his last:
        he couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I think Linda started crying and he just was
        overwhelmed by their emotion for him\u2014it meant a lot. The pottery tour
        meant a lot to Rich because he was involved with potters and working with
        the community more so than he ever had. He had always been pretty alone doing
        this so it was a real important step for him and their friendships meant a
        lot. He was always amazed at how big it was getting and it was growing exponentially
        every year and he just couldn''t get over that.\n01:41:35\nAW: Who were some
        of the regular customers? Who were some of the people coming during the Tour?\nEA:
        He had regular customers that came all year round. We could never be in that
        part of the house; we\u2019d always have a dog that would bark. We had fun
        little dog at the end: Max. And Max was great, he would bark, bark, bark and
        then we would know someone was out there and he would stand in front of the
        birch, and he would stand and look at the house and bark his head off like,
        \u201cHey somebody is over here, get over here.\u201d He was so funny.\nBut
        I think it''s because he did a lot of shows in the Cities and he did a lot
        of one-man shows at galleries and he built a reputation that way. It wasn''t
        so much the Valley that was supporting him in the beginning. Certainly certain
        people from the Valley would come; even when we were married in the Eighties,
        the preponderance of his customers came from the Cities, came from Minneapolis.
        Locals did not buy his stuff, which I found interesting because he always
        was very adamant about going to the local garage and local grocery store,
        local hardware store; he was very adamant about keeping things within the
        community. But I think that art in general, it''s like whenever painters have
        an art show, whenever I have an art show, it\u2019s the same old people that
        always show up, same people. There were never new people when I have a new
        show ever, maybe one or two, but it\u2019s the same people that buy art and
        show up, thank God, in support.\nAW: Why do you think there wasn\u2019t much
        support? Who was the community at the time that Richard moved there?\nEA:
        It was pretty agrarian even back then, over fifty years ago\u2014that was
        pretty agrarian. So of course there was Marine on St. Croix, which had a reputation
        for sort of a bedroom community of wealthy people because they lived on the
        river, just like White Bear Lake would have been a bedroom community of wealthy
        people. A lot of people that lived in Marine or bought into it had cottages
        or homes on the river and lived other places. But the other half were the
        working stiffs, so there were some people that bought in the town and some
        of those wealthier people would invite us to certain goings-on and Richard
        always laughed and said, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with
        us if we weren\u2019t artists.\u201d\n01:45:13\nAW: So did he start seeing
        a shift, though? Now that the art shows are here?\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n20\nEA: That shift has come in the last
        ten years.\nAW: How and why did that happen do you think?\nEA: Well maybe
        little more than ten years. Stillwater, when I was growing up, I remember
        the big flood of \u201865 and I was a senior and nobody wanted to go to Stillwater\u2014it
        was just like a black hole. Then it became a river town and people had a little
        more money and a little more time to spend and art fairs started developing
        in the Seventies. In the Seventies and in the late Sixties, but particularly
        the Sixties, art fairs started in the late Sixties developing across the country
        and at that time an art fair, you didn\u2019t go and find anything but high
        quality painters and craftsmen. That was just the real beginning of the whole
        craft renaissance. So how has this developed? There are people that still
        get out and about, but there are still a limited number of people that buy.
        Pottery is different; pottery is functional for the most part. You buy it
        and you can use it; it''s like a woman and jewelry: you can always find a
        reason to spend the money. A painting is a totally different ballgame. Usually
        people who buy paintings are buying them for themselves. A lot of people buying
        pottery buy them as gifts. You\u2019re not going to spend $400, $500, $1000,
        $2000 on a gift for somebody, unless you have a scad of money; you just don''t.
        You just buy pots.\nI don''t go on the pottery tour regularly, for one thing
        Rich and I were too busy, and we would never would go on\u2014although they
        tried one year, this was the kicker, and Bob always feels so bad about that.
        They decided one year that they were all going to visit everyone\u2019s studio.
        Everyone was going to stop and we\u2019d have a little something to eat and
        just visit the studios. So we went around and nobody showed up; they all said
        it, Rich took them at their word, but nobody showed up except Bob and a couple
        of his guests. Everybody else was just too busy and it was just one of those
        deals. Poor Bob always has to apologize for that, that\u2019s so funny, but
        it''s amazing how many people show up for these. I had potters stay with me
        for this pottery tour, and the thing is ever since Rich died I would always
        say whatever I can do, if someone wants to live with me and create pots in
        the studio, then whatever. This is the only year that somebody really did
        anything. Then I went up there to this paella dinner that he had and Warren
        MacKenzie and his wife were there and a lot of those acolytes and a young
        man that had just gotten a Fulbright grant and had been in Taiwan for six
        months, and they were all this community of people interested in each other
        and warm and talking and it is something I never witnessed with Rich. I think
        this is a new thing, maybe not. But when Guillermo and Bob do the pottery
        tour they have an eight-course meal\u2014this takes scads of volunteers. They\u2019re
        not doing it on their own. They have a huge number of people that come in
        and work for them for nothing, prepare food, make food, donate food. For me
        it was like to really finally get it, what Heather Rutledge\u2014who runs
        ArtReach Alliance\u2014says, \u201cIt is a community, it is striving for the
        community that makes art successful, makes a better community, it is all of
        us together, it in enhances, enriches, improves relations in cities and towns.\u201d
        When people do this sort of thing. It has to be advertised and emphasized
        that this is what this is about and you see that in action at those two places,
        and I don''t know that anyone else puts on the food.\nBut when they first
        started the pottery tour\u2014now there\u2019s the Southern pottery tour,
        there is the Western, the Eastern, there''s pottery tours all over and they
        were certainly one of the first in the Valley and now it''s become huge. And
        it''s really interesting how it''s grown and how it''s A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n21\ndeveloped and thousands of people,
        they fly in for it; you\u2019re just not going to have that for a painter
        because the money involved is just so totally different. But you can buy a
        pot for $40 or $15.\n01:53:00\nAW: Why do you think it grew so much? Why has
        it been successful?\nEA: It''s a beautiful area, it\u2019s a destination,
        they\u2019re feeding you for nothing at two of the places, you can go to the
        others and go get something to drink and then you can have a meal at Bob''s
        and Guillermo\u2019s. I don''t know how they do it. But I don''t know that
        that''s the only answer. But I think it is a conflagration of all kinds of
        things that happen and then once it starts snow-balling it has a life of its
        own, it''s just exponential, and the mystery of it just begins. So then it
        always gets great press in the big newspapers, now it probably gets national
        press because it''s huge. How do they explain it?\nAW: Part of it is getting
        everybody together and joining the mailing lists certainly then opened everybody
        up to everybody else\u2019s mailing lists. That opened up the amount of people
        that might come visit a studio. That\u2019s one of the reasons. It\u2019s
        interesting that just changing the brochure to a full color brochure made
        a big difference. I can\u2019t remember for sure but the amount of visitors
        doubled in one year because of that. The power of marketing\u2014you find
        the right kind of thing that speaks to people and they flock to it. The number
        one answer is the quality of the work\u2014that that\u2019s what keeps bringing
        people back and people tell other people, \u201cCome to this. You\u2019ve
        got to check this out.\u201d That\u2019s been something too. The guest potters\u2014they
        bring more and more, the guest potters bring their own groups of customers
        and networks. Did you guys bring guest potters too? Did Richard have any guest
        potters?\nEA: No.\nAW: Why was that?\nEA: Because he didn''t have a huge community
        and he was getting sick. If he was only in it for twelve years, first of all
        you just see how it goes, and then you realize you just can''t do this anymore
        because he couldn\u2019t make pots and his health just wasn''t there.\nAW:
        Actually if we could talk about his health for a little bit. You said at first
        his shoulders? Is that common with potter?\nEA: I don\u2019t know if it was
        from throwing, although Bob Briscoe has had rotator cuff repair. It has to
        do with the fact that you''re handling huge amounts of weight and Rich worked
        like a stevedore, he was a very strongman. When I had my rotator cuff repaired
        they talked about the acromion, the orthopedic surgeon said, \u201cWell, you
        have a shoulder and the acromion is this bone that comes out and here\u2019s
        your joint and this is all covered by cartilage. If you\u2019re lucky, your
        acromion is out like this. If you\u2019re not lucky, it goes like this.\u201d
        That\u2019s the way mine is shaped. The more curve you have in your acromion
        the more impingement and problems if you\u2019re A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n22\nphysically, extremely active. Musicians
        end up having serious problems with that repetitive motion disorder. People
        don\u2019t think about that but if you\u2019re doing eight hours of music
        a day.\nBut he had serious heart issues from the fever and after we were married
        about ten years it became evident. He had high blood pressure and certainly
        was on medication by the time he was in his early fifties and was being medicated
        and he would have halter monitors and tests. He had a huge, enlarged heart.
        What''s interesting is a lot of the real breakthrough cardiac medicines were
        just coming into being in the Eighties and Nineties and, again, he wasn''t
        talking about his health.\nHe didn\u2019t talk about his health: he never
        complained. That man, he went through two open-heart surgeries that most people
        will never survive psychologically let alone one open-heart surgery\u2014he
        went through two just because he has such a high pain threshold. When we got
        married, I lived in a little rambler down the road and I had a huge 1880s
        upright piano, it was beautiful and had a sounding board and it literally
        weighed five hundred pounds. When I got the movers to come and get it they
        took apart that beautiful piece of furniture, destroyed the piano, and still
        couldn''t get the sounding board out of the basement. By that time I should
        have just told them to smash it because you\u2019ve ruined the piano. Rich
        single handedly grabbed that sounding board and humiliated those guys and
        said, \u201cListen why don\u2019t you do it this way,\u201d and he showed
        them how to haul it up the steps and the guys just sat there letting him do
        it by himself, this five hundred pound sounding board. Finally he said, \u201cWould
        you come here and grab this?\u201d So that didn\u2019t help his rotator cuff
        but he always worked. I think that the fact that he did work so hard, so consistently,
        probably helped him live to be seventy-seven years old. He never smoked, he
        never drank and he was extremely physically active and always thin.\n02:01:25\nAW:
        When did he stop doing the Tour?\nEA: I think it was like 2005, 2006, something
        like that maybe?\nAW: When did he pass?\nEA: In 2011. He may have done it
        up to 2008? I think it was 2007 or 2006. The last two years he was really
        ill.\nAW: When he stopped doing the Tour had he stopped most of the art shows
        by then? Was the pottery tour one of the last things to go?\nEA: Yes it was.
        He stopped throwing, he couldn\u2019t throw anymore and he just started painting.
        By seventy-three he just knew without ever saying anything, he never said
        anything. The only time he ever said anything was one time when we went out
        to visit Christian in Maryland and we''re getting in the car and Christian
        was walking around and he put his head down and just started to cry. It was
        so awful, and he said, \u201cThis is the last I will ever come back,\u201d
        and it was such a stunning statement. He was right, he knew he was dying and
        that he didn''t have that much longer and this is what he wanted to do, he
        wanted to do his yard work and paint, and that\u2019s what he did. Within
        those last five years we made one last trip to Europe to see his son Greg.
        But when the pottery tour would come up after that we didn\u2019t go. He used
        to say we would have this A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n23\ndiscussion
        because he wanted us out of here; he didn''t want me stuck with this place.
        I wanted him to just be able to die here and then I said, \u201cI\u2019ll
        get rid of it myself; it''ll be a cathartic thing for me to slowly get out
        of here.\u201d And now here I am, three years later, still wondering what
        the hell am I doing? What am I gonna do? He wanted to know that I had an idea
        and that sort of helped but he would say, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,
        I don''t need this, I can walk away from this.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re
        the artist, you\u2019re the one that has to always create, not me. I can do
        many things but you can\u2019t, you only do one thing.\u201d And he would
        always say that, \u201cNo, you\u2019re the real artist.\u201d I always said,
        \u201cNo, you can\u2019t walk away.\u201d\n02:05:32\nAW: Now that you\u2019ve
        talked about your background too: Where were you born? Did you grow up in
        Stillwater?\nEA: No, North St. Paul.\nAW: When were you born?\nEA: In 1947.\nAW:
        And when did you develop a passion for art or painting?\nEA: I don\u2019t
        remember, always. I drew from the time I could hold a pencil, that''s all
        I ever did. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to do. That''s all I ever did. I
        grew up in a household that appreciated art but not so much doing art, like
        painting or pottery, but they loved literature. Opera was in our house all
        the time. Music was huge in the house so opera always was big. My mother and
        father were basically first-generation immigrants; my mother was first-generation
        Lithuanian; my father was second-generation Scotch but his mother went back
        probably to Plymouth Rock. Basically I grew up in a household that had heavy
        accents and spoke in universal terms. They didn''t speak in terms that were
        provincial. But still they were not forward thinking in terms of what they
        wanted their daughters to do. They believed in education and they weren\u2019t
        going to say, \u201cNo you can\u2019t,\u201d but they thought women ended
        up getting married anyway.\nAW: How many siblings did you have?\nEA: There
        were six of us; I was the youngest of six so I have a brother that\u2019s
        going to be eighty-five in the fall. The gap was sort of interesting; Rich
        and I were thirteen years apart, but my parents were older than his parents
        so there was no generational [gap]. We grew up Catholic, we grew up with parents
        that had gone through the Depression and we grew up knowing World War II.
        We grew up of the same mind. It wasn\u2019t like there wasn''t some big difference
        between us because of the age. I have nieces now that are ten years older
        than their husbands, which I find delightful in some regard though I can\u2019t
        imagine marrying a younger man. (Laughs)\nAW: So where\u2019d you go to high
        school?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n24\nEA:
        I went to high school in North St. Paul and then I went to St. Joseph\u2019s
        School of Practical Nursing and then I went to the University of Minnesota,
        but I didn\u2019t graduate from the University. As far as art goes\u2014I
        always wanted art so my mother\u2014when I was in grade school I would take
        the bus into St. Paul Art Academy. A couple years, I would take classes in
        there. I was always taking art classes. I took art when I was at the University\u2014of
        course that was when everybody was stoned out of their mind. That was in the
        height of abstract expressionism so classical atelier study was out the window.
        They just thought it was dead. People like Rauschenberg and those kinds of
        painters\u2014they just felt like non-traditional painting. It\u2019s funny
        realism is gone but now it\u2019s coming back: photorealism. Abstraction isn\u2019t
        so much \u201cit\u201d anymore. It\u2019s a combination of medias that is
        now important in art. Mixed media\u2014audiovisual, performance art, it\u2019s
        really interesting what\u2019s going on nowadays. It\u2019s a huge variety.
        I don\u2019t know how anybody makes money now.\n02:10:55\nAW: They do. I think
        certainly technology has helped.\nEA: In terms of selling, yes, exactly.\nAW:
        Did you guys run a website?\nEA: No, it was so funny. He wanted a computer
        so we got a computer. Then he was the one interested in it but then, of course,
        I was advancing on a computer because I worked outside the home, and you had
        to use a computer at the hospital; that''s how everything went. Then, interesting
        enough, when I was at hospice I had really hurt my shoulder so I couldn\u2019t
        go back and so I went back to the hospital and I became secretary and then
        that''s all computer work; and now that job\u2019s completely changed, so
        at sixty I changed a career there, more or less. Since then I''ve been all
        over the map lately.\nAW: When did you start working as a nurse?\nEA: In my
        early twenties. When I was married the first time I had stopped--we were having
        children\u2014and then I went back into nursing when Rich and I were married.
        Both of us\u2014our previous marriages\u2014were married and had the insurance,
        so somebody had to have the insurance so I went back and worked as a nurse
        part-time and then we had health insurance, so I did that right away.\nAW:
        And your art\u2014you said you went to the St. Paul Art Academy, doing all
        kinds of things as a young artist?\nEA: For a while I lived in Oklahoma. I
        went down there and I would take classes down at the Gilcrease Center for
        the Arts. That was real influential on me because I met working artists and
        I would take drawing classes. I would, at night, go up to these big figure
        studies classes and I was so young\u2014I graduated from high school when
        I was seventeen\u2014and so then I was eighteen\/nineteen and everybody was
        a lot older than me and I was just young. But they were so A Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n25\nwilling to impart their wisdom.
        I would go to these live drawing classes and it was all nude models, my God\u2014it
        was amazing. So that was a great influence on me.\nAW: And when did you start
        producing paintings? When did you have your first show?\nEA: I started producing
        paintings in my first marriage. I started taking classes\u2014I took a class
        in watercolor with Judy Blaine because I couldn''t work\u2014I had a reaction
        to oil and I wanted to do something that was easy cleanup\u2014I was always
        the practical one\u2014and I had children so wanted to do something that was
        easily cleaned up that I could set up and take down that would be immediate,
        and I thought of watercolor. So I would get these videos from the library
        and then I would take every watercolor class that I could get my hands on.
        They have big watercolor three-day workshops. I did that all the time. I would
        see these videos from watercolor artists on the West Coast\u2014and at that
        time the American Watercolor Society was pretty strident how its approach
        to watercolor\u2014everything had to be translucent in the classical so-called
        English style of plain air painting. But these California artists from early
        on did what they damn pleased; they used chalk, charcoal, wash, and they did
        all kinds of different things when they painted. And that was so appealing
        to me and drawing\u2014what I preferred most about watercolor was the real
        visceral fact that you held your objects right in hand and that they dried\u2014it
        was just very appealing to me.\nSo I started selling\u2014my sister, we used
        to have a little antique shop and I would frame up and do paintings and sell
        it there. I would walk into galleries just with a portfolio of my work and
        just say, \u201cLook at my stuff,\u201d and they would all\u2014I would go
        down the list and ask for appointments and they would let me in and laugh
        me out. That happened again and again. They would ask things like, \u201cDo
        you have a degree?\u201d and I would say, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, how
        do you think you\u2019re going to compete? You can\u2019t even draw.\u201d
        Constantly doors slammed in my face. I just kept trying and trying and then
        me and a couple of women did a little tiny art show. This was before the Marine
        Art Guild and I think actually we started the whole idea and I would sell
        my paintings for like $17. In fact people have come up to me and said, \u201cI
        have three types of your paintings.\u201d First it was Edie Vendel, when I
        was first married and then I would sign Edie Vendel Abnet, and then I signed
        Edie Abnet. My father was very disturbed\u2014because his mother was the painter\u2014that
        I didn''t keep my maiden name. When I divorced my first husband I went to
        a woman lawyer because there were abuse issues with my first marriage, so
        I found a woman that was used to handling abuse situations and she said, \u201cSo
        you paint? Well why don''t you bring your work in and let me see maybe we
        could do a trade.\u201d So I traded art for her services and she handled my
        divorce for basically nothing.\n02:17:30\nAW: So what brought you to the Stillwater
        area and Marine on St. Croix?\nEA: My first marriage. There was a place for
        sale; he worked for 3M. My brother had moved out here and his wife and they
        had talked about a little place further towards Marine that was for sale and
        it was very reasonable. I had gotten money from my parents from the sale of
        a cabin we used to have and so we bought it and that''s how I got to the area.
        I just would slowly sell my things at\u2014I would go to art shows. Rich got
        me\u2014when he first got involved with the Art [Guild], he A Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n26\nwas doing a show out at Apache
        Plaza, and Apache Plaza had a national reputation. There''s this famous\u2014it\u2019s
        in Indiana, what is the name of that University in Indiana? It had a famous
        art fair, big national reputation. At any rate, he would sell out\u2014Apache
        Plaza is over by Fridley\u2014he would almost sell out in the first four hours.
        People waited in line to buy his pots and so when we first met he said, \u201cI
        know the people that put this show on. I think you should get into the Apache
        Plaza show.\u201d So he opened up venues for me in that regard and we used
        to drive there and laugh; we were friends, we were good friends. So that''s
        another beginning of how I just started doing it. And I would paint at night
        after the kids would go to bed and I would just start painting.\nAW: And Richard
        would be in his studio all day?\nEA: This was before Rich. The end of that
        big room out there was my first studio and so I painted here. And then after
        maybe five years, when he decided he wanted to tear the old house down and
        make that addition, he also started building the studio above the pottery
        for me so that I was able to move up there. And that''s when I''d be upstairs
        and he would be downstairs creating art. That was now quite a few years.\n02:20:25\nAW:
        I find it inspiring the kind of connection you guys had through art and craft
        that you were making.\nEA: It was inspiring. It was special. I know a few
        widows and I feel\u2014I think basically from pretty early on we knew Rich
        had a bad heart and we had been through so much with both of our bad marriages
        that we never took anything for granted with each other and we knew it was
        a gift: that relationship that stimulated him, stimulated me, stimulate our
        creativity, our art\u2014it was special. Rather than I wanted more of it,
        my attitude is, I was lucky I had what I got. So few people have those connections.
        So few people ever find their soul mate, not that it''s blissful throughout
        the whole thing because it wasn''t; it was very difficult with seven children
        and the insanity of the spouses that you dealt with and didn\u2019t know what
        you were dealing with. We worked hard at everything but we also know we had
        been given a gift. Although in one regard, people would come in here and look
        around and say to Rich, \u201cBoy are you lucky.\u201d If they only knew,
        he said, \u201cLuck has nothing to do with this. This is hard work.\u201d
        I don''t know if he would even correct them but it was one of those things
        that made him crazy. It\u2019s the same with relationships. People will say,
        \u201cOh, you\u2019re so lucky you have talent.\u201d Well talent only takes
        you so far; brains, anything only takes you just so far\u2014you have to work
        at it. Nothing else will follow if you don''t apply the sweat equity. Why
        is the pottery tour successful? Because of the sweat equity, because they
        work really hard. And you go up there and there''s so much work and so that
        nobody goes up there and just does nothing. Then they get volunteers who simply
        love it, to work as hard as they do. Somebody said to Woody Allen once, \u201cWhat
        does it take to be successful?\u201d And he said, \u201cYou just show up.
        That\u2019s all it takes.\u201d That\u2019s not all, but for jobs or anything,
        you just have to show up. There are a lot of people who can\u2019t even do
        that.\nAW: I think you\u2019re right on with sweat equity. Just hearing from
        the interviews we\u2019ve done how much time has gone into preparing for the
        Tour, managing the Tour, when they\u2019ve brought guest A Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n27\npotters in how to make everyone
        feel comfortable and welcome. All of that is a lot of work but it seems to
        have created this amazing tour here.\nEA: I wonder what''s going to happen
        because Bob talks about retiring. Jeff talks about retiring. I don\u2019t
        know how old Jeff is, but Bob is exactly my age.\n02:25:20\nAW: Do you have
        hopes for the Tour in the future?\nEA: As you would have hopes for art in
        any community you have to keep giving back. What''s interesting too is\u2014have
        you ever been up to the Franconia Sculpture Gardens? That has taken off\u2014again,
        another sweat equity. But what helped establish them was a wonderful financial
        base, the Cowles, and then the sweat equity followed and the enthusiasm followed.
        Obviously just throwing money at something isn\u2019t the only thing. How
        will they replace?\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be careful. Now when
        Rich left, they got Guillermo\u2014wonderful, and wonderful who he brought
        in\u2014so it depends. But none of them are thirty, the main group of those
        potters. I wonder as a group do they talk about it?\nAW: I think some are
        starting to talk about this but Bob is definitely reflecting a lot on this
        and thinking through this.\nEA: Yeah, and he had said\u2014when I was up there
        and we were finishing Rich\u2019s pots\u2014that he was hoping that a young
        potter will come in there. How young? Does he have money behind him so he
        can buy your place? I know hard it is has been\u2014and I get it, you get
        it better once you\u2019ve tried. It will be interesting to talk to this young
        man.\nAW: I think you\u2019re touching on something here that the personalities
        of the people who started the Tour, the potters\u2014they\u2019re not replaceable.
        Is this something that will sustain beyond those original founders?\nEA: Unfortunately,
        nothing lasts forever and you have to love something and it just doesn''t;
        my years in hospice taught me that and you have to accept that. You can try
        but just nothing does.\nAW: How has the Tour served as a model?\nEA: It has
        served as a model for what can be done when people work for a common goal\u2014when
        art is a basis. Art enriches a society, a culture, a community. It improves
        finances, it educates, it gives depth. When they first opened China to the
        Olympics after it had been gone they did little film vignettes of everybody\u2014and
        what was interesting was the Chinese have the attitude of looking holistically
        at the human being. One of the important aspects of a human being is their
        spiritual and creative needs. Every human being is creative, but it''s what
        happens in a culture to that creativity.\nNow the pottery tour, certainly,
        it is feeding that basic need that people want of things that are original,
        hand made, of the earth, that more and more our society falls away from. Now
        that you A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n28\nhave
        terms like the holistic attitude, you have mindfulness, maybe clich\u00e9d,
        but there is an important mindfulness about loving a beautifully made pot
        and looking at it and looking at its nuances and putting it to your lips and
        knowing that a human being made that. There used to be people that would come
        in here and say to Rich, \u201cI can go to a garage and buy a mug for five
        bucks. What makes you think I''m going to pay fourteen bucks for this mug?\u201d
        So there''s this whole discussion of that, Well right, but you can''t educate
        that attitude\u2014well you can, what you can do is hopefully maybe if not
        that individual but their child. And we have taken away art in schools. We
        have said it isn\u2019t important. We have said it''s not a part of who we
        are as human beings, and yet people flock because they really do need that.
        You can walk into the plainest downtown Minneapolis apartment and it is depressing
        if they have nothing on their walls. If you throw up a few paintings it alters
        that rectangular room. Why is that? You walk into a hospital, and if it has
        art on the walls it is comforting\u2014even for somebody who was a total rube
        that has never paid attention to anything in their lives, they feel it. People
        feel things even if they don''t know why they feel the way they are feeling\u2014I
        mean, if they walk and they can\u2019t even describe unaesthetic places\u2014but
        people have a sense in neighborhoods if everything is painted beige with four
        car garages right in the front on the curb with no sidewalks and they walk
        into a 1950s neighborhood with sidewalks and no garages and a big old elm
        tree\u2014they have a sense of something, it''s as simple as that. And hopefully
        something\u2014if not the pottery tour\u2014but then somebody else''s tour
        will keep going; art will improve.\n02:33:56\nEA: People can harp all they
        want about young people; I think that there is sensitivity and a communal
        feeling in young people that is very impressive to me. They talk about cell
        phones but I have a sense that they are establishing a contact and a basic
        sitting-around-the-fire-telling-stories sense of togetherness that in generations
        past they didn\u2019t even think they needed it. But now these young people
        are creating, they\u2019re calling it, \u201cThis is my tribe,\u201d or whatever\u2014and
        it''s not simplistic; it''s wonderful how they hold onto each other and talk
        to each other, and I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re all perfect. So goes art.
        Art does that for you. Beautiful things do that for you. I went to visit my
        daughter\u2014the little artist lives in Albuquerque\u2014and they have a
        balloon fest in October, hot air balloon fest. Five hundred hot air balloons
        go up in this massive valley before you go to the Rio Grande. You get up at
        five in the morning and you go down this valley, and it''s shoulder to shoulder
        and the mountains\u2014the sun is coming over the Sandia mountain\u2014and
        these brilliantly colored balloons are filled with whatever the gas is, and
        you walk on them and there is such a feeling of joy and love I have never
        felt\u2014well I have actually\u2014that feeling of everybody was happy and
        you could feel it, it was such a vibration. When you go to a beautiful performance\u2014I
        was just at the Matisse show\u2014when you''re up at Bob Briscoe\u2019s, when
        you''re in those atmospheres, you''ll feel more whole as a human being because
        it''s the truest sense of it is going on. Although, you know, a good Twins
        game when you\u2019re up in the grandstand of that beautiful stadium, that''s
        also pretty exciting. My son who has lived in Belgium twenty-plus years\u2014Rich\u2019s
        son\u2014and he brought his daughters and Marianna and he said, \u201cEurope
        doesn''t have this sort of thing. First of all, they don\u2019t encourage
        sports with young women. You can pay for it but you have to pay for it. There\u2019s
        nothing in the schools. There are, but they\u2019re not as common. The fact
        that everybody of all ages, of all social economic polyglot go in to watch
        a Twins game\u2014there\u2019s a ninety year old and a five year old\u2014nothing
        like that exists in Europe.\u201d I mean they have football, they have soccer,
        but they don''t have the age\u2014they don\u2019t have the huge A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n29\nvariety because they
        can be pretty rough and tumble, so it doesn''t appeal to as many across the
        board\u2014I mean it is hugely appealing, soccer, of course, to bazillions
        of people, but it is different than going to a Twins game.\n02:38:20\nAW:
        There is something about bringing everybody together to enjoy one sport together.
        Earlier you mentioned other tours and other shows?\nEA: There are a lot of
        tours that go on now, especially in the spring.\nAW: What is the boundary
        of the St. Croix River Valley?\nEA: There are no tours that I am aware of
        that go much beyond Harris, which is Bob and those guys. But then it goes
        all the way down to Prescott and that\u2019s the end of the St. Croix River.
        The St. Croix River starts somewhere in northern Wisconsin, but that''s wild
        river\u2014that\u2019s all forest and wild river. But the river all the way
        down to Prescott\u2014there''s art fairs down there because that''s where
        it empties into the Mississippi River. Hudson''s is great because they have
        the Phipps; there is a huge art community that goes down to River Falls. There''s
        some nice art and pottery and River Falls always had a great art program too,
        the University of River Falls.\nAW: Do you think the Tour has influenced some
        of those other shows?\nEA: Oh, of course, absolutely. Everybody wants some
        of the action.\nAW: Do you have a sense of what the Tour has meant for the
        local community in various ways, maybe financially or in terms of supporting
        local artists? What has the Tour meant for the St. Croix River Valley?\nEA:
        Well of course the potters are feeding them so they\u2019re not going to restaurants,
        but that''s probably not true. I know how you measure that but I don\u2019t
        know. When we did the Marine Art Fair, for example, we would limit it to seventy-five
        artists. Now it''s close to three hundred and it''s a mayhem, and nobody goes
        up there because they say its all schlock and the town hated us. You don''t
        have that kind of attitude any more. That''s how things have changed in the
        last twenty-five years. You go from small communities that don''t want these
        sorts of festivals, but now they come to people like ArtReach Alliance, and
        Heather Rutledge down there put on a workshop, but they talked about the community
        connection and how to get art festivals and how to get communities involved
        in the arts and how it is better for everybody. You''re certainly familiar
        with southern Wisconsin and all the little restaurants and pizza places and
        how huge that is. They''ve got all these little breweries and cheese places;
        people from Minneapolis can''t wait to go down there and there''s these places
        that are set up for just pizza and beer\u2014and the idea of doing weddings
        here. So things are just moving in that direction of basic stuff, making things
        with your hands, being out in the country, it''s beautiful out there, those
        are beautiful places to go, and even if it''s raining they like to go up there.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n30\nAW: We\u2019ve
        heard from others about the weather. Did the weather ever affect the showing
        of the audience, the various people who would come or not? There\u2019s all
        kinds of weather the Tour has experienced being in early May.\nEA: I don''t
        think it''s ever affected them that I''m aware of. How did the Tour do this
        year?\nAW: I think they did really well, maybe as good as or better than last
        year, even though it was rainy and cold.\nEA: I know that I''ve heard Bob
        talk about that it was like half his income; it\u2019s just huge what they
        do.\nAW: This is good. I think we\u2019ve covered a lot. There are one or
        two reflecting questions so this might be hard because I\u2019m asking you
        to think about what Richard might reflect on. What do you think pottery meant
        in his life?\nEA: It was a way of expressing who he was. Pottery expressed
        his need to make things with his hands. It expressed his relationship with
        the land and with his environment. It enriched and fulfilled him.\n02:44:48\nAW:
        And I\u2019d like to ask you too, what has painting meant in your life?\nEA:
        It saved my life. I think Rich could have done a lot of stuff, but painting
        did save my life. I can still up and work and I always feel better when I
        work, and when I don''t work I don''t feel good, but I''ve got to be more
        disciplined. I could work my way out of a lot of bad stuff. Art always helped
        me express myself and it''s not that I do stuff that is necessarily socially
        relevant\u2014I do decorative things, but they\u2019re original to me.\nAW:
        Thank you for sharing that. You\u2019ve talked about some of this already
        but any final thoughts about your life here with Richard or about Richard\u2019s
        work or about the Tour and what the Tour has meant for you guys?\nEA: Actually
        I didn''t think much about the Tour. It\u2019s just now meeting Guillermo,
        and the Tour became more important after Rich died. What was interesting about
        the way he and I worked was\u2014you didn\u2019t pot because of the Tour.
        He didn\u2019t make pots because of the Tour and Richard wasn\u2019t making
        half his income at that point. The Tour has really taken off the last twelve
        years or ten years. It was always up-and-coming, but it\u2019s just grown
        in the last\u2014what would they say? It\u2019s always successful, but it''s
        just really gone beyond their wildest dreams lately. I think that''s the thing,
        but it wasn''t like, Boy, we\u2019re onto something big here. We never had
        discussions like that because there were pretty critical things going on at
        that point. I think that those are questions that have become more relevant
        with the Tour of late, you know, post-Rich. I think it''s wonderful and amazing
        what art can do in a community and what it means. I think everybody should
        stand up and take notice, but still it''s the pottery tour so that there''s
        a lot of people that don''t know anything about it, just basics of it. I bet
        if you go down to the Marine Brookside Bar A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nE.
        Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n31\nand you sat there and talk to people they\u2019re not
        going to talk about how wonderful, \u201cBoy, what the pottery tour does for
        us economically.\u201d\nAW: So there\u2019s still some kind of separation
        between the local community and the Tour?\nEA: Yeah, in general. I''m sure
        there\u2019s a huge portion of people that work at the hospital who have no
        idea about the pottery tour or if they''ve heard about it at all but they
        don\u2019t think about it in relevant terms or how has it had an impact on
        the Valley; that\u2019s historians or the potters themselves. First of all
        there never were this many potters in the Valley. Now it''s sort of like every
        other person you meet is a potter, for God sakes. (Laughs) How many potters
        live in the Valley? It''s just huge. There weren''t that many potters even
        ten years ago. Guillermo hasn\u2019t even been here fifteen years. It was
        Rich and Warren MacKenzie, and Warren was a university professor. Is that
        a function of the pottery tour\u2014that there\u2019s so many potters?\n02:50:45\nAW:
        That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to find out.\nEA: There are a lot of things
        that have gone on too. St. Croix Falls has a huge arts center, The Art Barn,
        and then there''s festival theaters all over the place. I don''t know that
        it''s just a function that it\u2019s potters, but art is going on more and
        more. The Worm Farm\u2014have you ever heard of the Worm Farm? In this little
        southern Wisconsin town how The Worm Farm is sort of grown like the Mayday
        Parade. The woman that runs the Heart of the Beast Puppet Theater just got
        a huge thing, basically it\u2019s [a McKnight Distinguished Artist Award]
        for what she\u2019s done in a community\u2014it used to be this little tiny
        parade that\u2019s now huge; even Vietnam Vets want to get involved now. So
        these things start creating a life outside\u2014you know, the pottery tour,
        of course, it''s good for local businesses, but it is other things happen.
        One time a woman showed up at the Marine Art Fair and she said, \u201cHow
        do you get into this?\u201d and Rich said, \u201cWell you make something.
        You''re an artist. What do you do?\u201d And she said, \u201cNothing, but
        I''ll think of something.\u201d There is sort of that that goes on. I get
        six flyers those two months around the pottery tour of various things going
        on. Now fall is coming up and they never did anything in the fall but now
        they don''t have a pottery tour, but the artists, they have individual shows.
        There''s this snowball effect that''s happening.\nAW: Did Richard ever compare
        the ways that the art shows happened and the Tour happened, or any kind of
        differences about how and why they worked and the relationships between them?\nEA:
        I think for one thing artists have always kind of known that people love to
        go to artists\u2019 studios and see where people live so that in itself is
        a critical component to the pottery tour. Initially you\u2019d think, \u201cGod,
        gas is so expensive. Why do you want to come from south Minneapolis to drive
        all the way up there?\u201d Well because it''s interesting to see how these
        people live and then to see other potters. There\u2019s the quality and there''s
        the food and even if it''s raining, who cares? You''re seeing where the wildlife
        live; you\u2019re in their environment.\n02:55:00\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nE. Abnet\n06\/23\/14\n32\nAW: That\u2019s a really important
        point of what is bringing people.\nEA: Oh people love to look, \u201cCan I
        see where you paint?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d They do, it\u2019s important.
        You know it\u2019s like how they preserve writers\u2019 places; you want to
        go in and see where people created their works, sat at that desk, where\u2019s
        the typewriter, what window they looked out, what they thought about\u2014to
        look at environments. They look at those environments because they imagine
        themselves working these humdrum lives and so they go in and they see these
        different environments and they wonder if they could do it and they know they
        couldn''t do it: the whole mystery of what an artist is; it\u2019s all fascinating
        for people.\nAW: I think so. I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed getting to talk to
        everyone and to see where they\u2019re living and working. I\u2019ve learned
        a lot more about the people behind the crafts that they\u2019re making. We\u2019ve
        taken up a lot of your time. Thank you for sharing your stories and your memories.
        Is there anything else that you want to share or we should know?\nEA: I talked
        more than I ever thought I would. A lot of your questions I wish I could answer
        them better. I know in general the impact to questions like how is the pottery
        tour impacting our community? It''s impacting it in an obvious and not so
        obvious and subtle ways.\nAW: Well thank you so much, I think we\u2019ll end
        the interview here.\n02:57:35\nEND OF INTERVIEW\n","transl":{},"fullrs":{},"find":"102.pdf","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2015-02-12","dmmodified":"2015-02-12","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"101","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"363751","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.35

        made possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Also
        present during this interview is Tierney McNabb [Project Assistant]. Bob,
        thank you for agreeing to be interviewed. Let\u2019s get started. If you could,
        tell us when and where were you born? Where did you grow up?\nRB: I was born
        in Kansas City, Kansas in 1947 and I grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. I went
        to high school in Kansas City, Missouri college preparatory school for boys
        called Rockhurst High School. Really excellent, Jesuit preparatory school.
        Very tough. I wasn\u2019t probably as smart as I needed to be for that school
        but it was good for me. I lived in Kansas City until I was nineteen. I moved
        to Colorado to serve in an apprenticeship with a couple of potters in Colorado
        Springs and then came back to Kansas City in 1971 to\u2014I had fractured
        my knee and I had no money and I had to come limping home to my parents. When
        that healed I decided to get a job and save A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n2\nmoney to start my own pottery. I did that for six
        years and saved every penny and got married in the middle of that, too, to
        Johanna Von Meyerhauser. We\u2019re divorced now but we\u2019re still best
        friends. She\u2019s now Jo Severson and she\u2019s still a potter now. Anyway,
        we had a studio in Kansas City during that six years and then we bought property
        in Minnesota just because the land was cheap. Minnesota had no other attraction
        to me other than there were winters here, which I really wanted to get away
        from Southern heat. My father had been in the National Guard and he had trained
        every summer at Camp Ripley in Minnesota\u2014literally the only connection
        I had to Minnesota\u2014there were no pottery connections, there were no art
        connections, there were no friends; I knew nobody here. We just moved on a
        lark. We bought land by Little Falls, Minnesota and built a studio and house
        and started out our career as potters. Pretty much failed immediately. First
        I got a job bartending at a little tavern nearby my place there. Then I got
        a job at the Brainerd Foundry and worked there for a year and a half. Worst
        job I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Most interesting job I\u2019ve had outside
        of pottery, but it was medieval at best. Physically, the most demanding thing
        I\u2019ve ever had to do at a daily basis. It made being a potter look like
        vacation, and being a potter is actually fairly hard, too. I quit that job
        in 1978, and I\u2019ve had no other income but pottery since. That\u2019s
        kind of my general history. I\u2019ve been a professional potter ever since.
        I\u2019ve been selling pots since 1971, but I didn\u2019t consider myself
        a professional until 1978 when I made the leap.\nAW: Can you tell us more
        about what it was like growing up? What your family was like?\nRB: My father
        was a manager of a grocery store at a local Kansas City chain\u2014a small
        chain. Very family oriented business. Our whole lives were surrounding his
        job. He worked all the time. He started out as a sacker at this store and
        worked his way up to be a manager and eventually, after I moved away, he became
        a Chief Operating Officer or something like that. My mom\u2014stay at home
        mom. There were four brothers and sisters and my grandmother lived with us
        in kind of a Catholic, blue-collar neighborhood. Art was not part of our lives.
        I think my mother wanted it to be, but we were just blue-collar to the max.
        She was sort of a writer. She was published several times but minor things.
        I think she probably would have been good at it if she hadn\u2019t been a
        mom.\n00:06:00\nAW: What were your parents\u2019 names?\nRB: Vernon and Charlotte.
        She was all Irish and he was Dutch English. We had a huge family, mostly on
        my mother\u2019s side. My father didn\u2019t have any relatives; they were
        all dead. My mother had hundreds and it was a pretty tight-knit Irish clan.
        There would be a Fourth of July party would be four hundred very closely related,
        almost no other ethnic people. One of my aunts married a Polish guy, and that
        was the shock of the family that she married someone outside the Irish race.
        They weren\u2019t rude\u2014I mean, it was more kind of fun but Matt Portaberry
        (??) he fit perfect and he was a hilarious character, so they couldn\u2019t
        do anything to him. It was a good environment.\nAW: Had they grown up in Kansas
        City, too?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n3\nRB:
        Yeah, they were born and raised there. My father left to go to the war, that
        was it. They had no desire to leave. After he retired they went to Ireland
        for my mother\u2019s sake\u2014she was chasing down her family history because
        it was important to her. None of my siblings were into art. I have a sister
        that is a medical technologist and married a cellular biologist, a brother
        who is kind of in sales of medical equipment, and a younger sister who works
        in human resources for a big corporation in Dallas, and my younger brother
        became a kind of world-renowned macro-biotic teacher and philosopher: David
        Briscoe. He\u2019s written books and he\u2019s really quite the famous fellow
        in that world.\nAW: Where do you fall within the order of siblings?\nRB: Right
        in the middle. One each above and one each below.\nAW: Tell me more about
        your early education experiences.\nRB: I went to a Catholic grade school and
        went to an all boys Catholic Jesuit high school, which was very discipline
        oriented\u2014not military school type\u2014but rigorous academics. I played
        sports. There was no art program at school, absolutely none. I don\u2019t
        think we ever talked about art. I\u2019m not even sure the word was ever mentioned.
        Their whole focus was to get you to go to college, and ninety-seven or ninety-eight
        percent of them did from that school. It was a really, really good school.
        I got a really great education there, and it taught me a lot about the academic
        search. You kind of went to school, you went home, and studied. I mean, I
        was out of breath the entire time I was in high school. I was up until ten
        or eleven at night trying to get my homework done. I don\u2019t remember if
        there was a day that I went to high school that I wasn\u2019t completely terrified
        of being unprepared. But I enjoyed it.\n00:10:00\nAW: How did you get into
        art and ceramics especially?\nRB: I went to a junior college that was in my
        neighborhood\u2014Catholic, as well\u2014I don\u2019t even know why that\u2019s
        a theme, but it is\u2014but it was cheap. It was $140 a semester, and I could
        walk to school. It was taught by Benedictine nuns, and I had an art appreciation
        class that I didn\u2019t want to take, had no use for it. They had a young
        woman professor who\u2019s husband was the sculpture professor at the Kansas
        City Art Institute and so she would bring in students from the Art Institute
        to do demos\u2014drawing, painting\u2014and one of them happened to be a potter,
        and I was flabbergasted by it. He demonstrated it. My first reaction wasn\u2019t,
        I want to do that. It was, I want to have some of it. I like to cook\u2014I\u2019ve
        always liked to cook so I thought, These pots would be great, you know, for
        cooking. I started seeking out pots. I didn\u2019t have any money, but pots
        were cheap. There weren\u2019t very many potters, actually. I found this one
        fellow named James Vandergrift at a little craft art fair in Parkville, Missouri,
        and I bought a couple of coffee cups from him. Later, I saw him at another
        event and bought some kind of serving bowl. He suggested that I come out to
        his studio and give it a try. That was like, Really? Me? So I did, and it
        was a blast; by the end of that summer I went every day. I worked from three-thirty
        to midnight, and I\u2019d get up at six in the morning and I\u2019d run two
        miles and I \u2018d take a shower and then I\u2019d go out to the studio and
        I\u2019d work all day until two-thirty and then I\u2019d drive to my job.
        I did that. I was A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n4\nterrible.
        At the end of the summer I wasn\u2019t a whole lot better than the first day
        I went there. But I had completely put on the mantle that I was going to be
        a potter the rest of my life. I was nineteen, and I was smitten, as much as
        you could be smitten. That was the summer of my first year at Kansas State
        University. I only went there because they had a bakery management school
        and, within the bakery management school, they had a restaurant management
        division. My plan was to learn restaurant management, go to France, learn
        to be a cook, come home and open a restaurant. That was my big plan, which
        I\u2019ve always been grateful that that fell through. But I took art at Kansas
        State, but I couldn\u2019t take ceramics until I had Design 1, Drawing 1,
        and there was some other class that I had to take. Again, I didn\u2019t want
        to take any of this. I just wanted to take a pottery class. Finally, the next
        semester, after I\u2019d worked at this place over the summer, I went and
        I signed up for ceramics and changed my major to\u2014around that time I was
        in the College of Commerce\u2014I had decided to give up on the bakery thing\u2014I
        was in the College of Commerce and I hated it, and I transferred to the Arts
        and Sciences. I ended up getting a degree later in economics, but I also took
        ceramics, every course they offered. And, Design 2, and you know, whatever
        else they made me take. It was a good experience. A guy named Angelo Garzio
        was the ceramics professor, and they had two or three other professors: Eric
        Abraham and\u2014can\u2019t remember all of them. Anyway, the Vietnam War
        was raging and I was actively protesting the war in Vietnam, and I dropped
        out of school to do that full-time because it was really the other passion.
        I went out to Colorado and I apprenticed with a couple\u2014after I dropped
        out of school\u2014for another year and a half out there, named Lou and Al
        Wynne.\n00:15:30\nAW: How do you spell that?\nRB: W-y-n-n-e. He was a painter\/potter
        and she was a potter. She taught junior high art. They took me on as an apprentice
        and it was a really wonderful time. It ended a little badly over a minor thing,
        so I went on my way. That next year I went back to Colorado to Fort Collins.
        I had really loved Colorado, and I went to Fort Collins to be a\u2014I was
        thinking of going to school there but it was so expensive I just couldn\u2019t\u2014out
        of state tuition\u2014so I thought, Well, I\u2019ll just become a resident
        and then I\u2019ll get cheaper tuition. In the meantime, we formed a group
        at this gallery studio. There was a leather worker, a candle maker, there
        were two potters and a photographer. Out of the basement of this big gallery
        we ran classes and had an arts center, of sorts. We all had fantasies of buying
        a building together and\u2014I was never a hippie but it was kind of that
        alternative living stuff. And then I broke my knee right about then and had
        to leave. At that time, the sum total of my wealth was a 1964 International
        Travel all that had no windows that were not broken and a potter\u2019s wheel
        and whatever clothes I had on my back. I moved back to Kansas City to heal,
        and then get a job. I got a job at the grocery company that my father worked
        for in the produce department, which I liked. Eventually I became the manager
        of the department, and I did that for six years. It paid well and I was able
        to save a lot of money and buy land in Minnesota. As soon as we had the building
        built and the land paid for, we had no debt and we moved up here, in September.
        And, by January, I had no money and I was looking for a job. I think that
        brings it up to the Minnesota phase here.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n5\nAW: Yeah, thank you, and if we could go back a little
        bit. When you had this moment when you realized you were smitten with pottery\u2014why
        do you think you became so? Over the course of the summer, you just realized
        this passion? Tell us a bit more.\nRB: I think there were some real distinct
        reasons. I think because my parents wanted us to not live their life, you
        know; they didn\u2019t want us to work with our hands. They wanted us to go
        to college\u2014they didn\u2019t get to that. My mother did eventually. My
        father, you know, he renovated houses and then would rent them out. We all
        did the work with him\u2014painted the houses, fixed the plaster\u2014but
        he would never let us do any of the mechanical kind of things: the wiring,
        the plumbing, all of that. We\u2019d just hand him tools. I think there was
        a desire to work\u2014the hand part. I think when you finally start realizing
        that you can actually make something from your imagination with your hands,
        you start seeing the possibilities. You can start visioning a life of being
        in control of what you do with your time. Also, because of my mindset about
        Vietnam and the lies that were being told, you know, government, and family,
        and everything about\u2014when you\u2019re nineteen and you wake up and realize
        that there\u2019s a big lie being told. I\u2019ve always used the analogy
        it\u2019s like seeing your father walk into a motel with a strange woman.
        Suddenly you\u2019re like, Wow, you\u2019re life kind of falls\u2014the bottom
        falls out. In pottery, it was like I could be the person who controlled the
        lie. If somebody was going to tell a lie, it would have to be me. That became
        really important to me, besides the joy of actually imagining something and
        then putting it into three dimensions through clay. That in itself was huge,
        but if you put this other set of circumstances around\u2014and then, when
        you get into making pots and then you start building kilns, start designing
        the materials\u2014you become a carpenter, bricklayer, an engineer, a chemist.
        All of those things in conjunction with being an artist, and then, later you
        then have to have business skills\u2014it just felt like this complete package,
        and that was new. That felt really good. It felt like you could be a whole
        person and it felt authentic. I can\u2019t emphasize enough the idea of who\u2019s
        telling the truth. You can live your value system through being a handmaker
        because you\u2019re describing what it is to people; they\u2019re buying it,
        they\u2019re using it. You can hide anything, but, you know, you\u2019re the
        person who\u2019s doing that lie. It\u2019s really important to me: my values
        are.\n00:22:30\nAW: I think that\u2019s so interesting the way you\u2019ve
        put it and if you could say a bit more about that. What would be the truth?
        Can you say a few more words about that?\nRB: Somebody asked me one time,
        \u201cHow do you price your work?\u201d and I think that question is wrapped
        up in this answer. You imagine the exchange between yourself and another person.
        They\u2019re clearly wanting something that you\u2019ve made, which, right
        away, is almost payment enough, just the fact that they want it. Second of
        all, you know how much time you have in it and the cost of materials and your
        life and your mortgage and all that. So you balance what you give and what
        you receive. Where it feels like it\u2019s valuable in both directions, then,
        that\u2019s the price. It might be less than other potters are charging, it
        might be a lot more. You wrap all it up in your own set of values about the
        world. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time in the studio thinking about the business
        part. I\u2019m not pure about it, but that\u2019s kind of my place where you
        make from the joy of making. I don\u2019t conceptualize a product, you know,
        where I\u2019m going to manufacture something that will be a hot item, or,
        I know people will love this. You do it for yourself, and then you figure
        out how to sell it. You try to do it in that order as opposed to figuring
        out what will sell A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n6\nand
        then make that. If you give enough time to it you actually start knowing things.
        But like I say, I\u2019m not a purist about it; I\u2019m doing this to make
        a living and I get to do it on my terms, which is huge. And the art part of
        it\u2014I probably haven\u2019t talked a lot about art because art was never
        part of my growing up. It was never part of any direction we were pushed towards
        or offered, so the art part of it is always mystery, and always will be. I
        don\u2019t consider myself an artist, but I do consider myself on the path
        to making art but whether I have? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s one of things
        you strive for. Art is a really difficult plateau to achieve because it\u2019s
        really rare, I think. I think in some ways we give that title to too much,
        too easily. And I think that it\u2019s something that\u2014I\u2019ve seen
        it. I\u2019ve felt it. I\u2019ve seen it in museums; I\u2019ve seen it in
        friends\u2019 of mine\u2019s work; I\u2019ve seen glimpses of it, maybe, in
        my own work, but it\u2019s a rare thing.\n00:26:30\nAW: What would be the
        pillars of a piece that is art?\nRB: This is oversimplified, but there are
        some things that sort of vibrate the space they\u2019re sitting in. They\u2019re
        not neutral. They\u2019re not passive, they\u2019re active. Sometimes that
        can be a really good design, could be a really good color or whatever, but
        when all that comes together and the piece has presence, it\u2019s unmistakable,
        whether you made it or somebody else made it. You walk through a museum and
        ninety percent is like, That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s
        a handsome thing. Suddenly, you\u2019re stopped in midstride and you\u2019re
        like, Wow. That\u2019s kind of how I see art, but it\u2019s individual. The
        art piece has always been\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say a struggle, but it\u2019s
        an achievement that I think you point yourself towards.\nAW: Hmm, interesting.
        When you first realized you were passionate about pottery, how did your family
        react?\nRB: They were horrified. You can imagine two parents have five children;
        they didn\u2019t get to go to college; they grew up in the Depression when
        they were hungry on a daily basis. And then for someone who is in college,
        looks like the brass ring is there for you to grab, and you thumb your nose
        at it\u2014I\u2019m sure they were really dismayed. Well, they were. But when
        you know, you know. Actually I was surprised a lot by their reaction because
        I thought they were really cool about raising us to be individuals. We weren\u2019t
        to tow some kind of line. They kind of liked that we were all different personalities
        and they applauded that. But, when you actively choose to go in that direction
        and to see them react\u2014I mean, they weren\u2019t negative, but their advice
        was to do something else. My father\u2014who for years said, \u201cThis is
        great. I\u2019m behind you all the way\u201d\u2014on my forty-seventh birthday
        he called me up and wished me happy birthday. At the end of the conversation
        that was probably thirty minutes long, he said, \u201cOh yeah, I wanted to
        ask you: are you still thinking about graduate school?\u201d [Laughs]\nAW:
        [Laughs] He\u2019s still hoping.\n00:30:00\nRB: I\u2019m damn near fifty and
        he\u2019s like--\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n7\nAW:
        --\u201cHave you thought of these other options?\u201d\nRB: You\u2019d think
        by then they would have figured it out. But there was a lot of trauma in the
        beginning. My girlfriend at the time dumped me because she thought I was wacko.
        I had a falling out with an older brother. My parents were just\u2014I mean,
        literally, they would come to my house in Kansas City, which was only two
        or three miles from their house where my shop was, my studio, and they wouldn\u2019t
        get out of the car. I had to meet them down on the curb. I would sit on the
        grass and talk to them through the window of their car. I always thought they
        just were not willing to approve. If they came up and, you know, looked at
        the studio, it would have been a sign of approval on their part and they weren\u2019t
        going to do that. It didn\u2019t matter. I used to sit there and smile. I\u2019d
        tell my wife at that time, \u201cYeah, my parents are here. I\u2019ll go out
        and visit them down at the curb because they won\u2019t come up.\u201d I thought
        it was humorous. It wasn\u2019t going to change me. This was\u2014it\u2019s
        real clear to me right now: those emotions of you knew what you were going
        to be doing the rest of your life. Really lucky.\nAW: I would say so, just
        to have that clarity of mind and purpose at such a young age, that\u2019s
        amazing.\nRB: Yeah, and there were no potters. That was the other part that
        was weird. I couldn\u2019t point myself at a model. A lot of the arguments
        I had with my father was, \u201cShow me an example.\u201d I couldn\u2019t.
        All the ceramics people that you would even look at were all professors. They
        all had a job at a university somewhere. There were no potters that you could
        find in 1967 who were making a living. I think they were out there, but they
        were very few. There might have been a few in North Carolina, you know, the
        traditional little potteries. Dotted here and there, there were people that
        were making the same decision. I think there was a cultural wave going across
        the country because of the Vietnam War because when I started doing art fairs
        in 1971, and more seriously in 1974 and 1975, there were a lot of us. There
        weren\u2019t a lot of potters, but there were always a few potters in every
        show. Those were really interesting times because everyone was in the same
        boat. There were no books. There were literally two books that you could put
        your fingers on that had any information about being a potter, [about] any
        technology. It was Clay and Glazes for the Potter, by Daniel Rhodes, which
        came out in 1967, I think. Then there was Bernard Leach\u2019s, A Potter\u2019s
        Book, which was published in 1934 and then republished in the United States
        in 1950, I think. That was about it. Then Rhodes came out with a book on kilns
        maybe a year or two later. Then there was a little more stuff starting to
        happen. You go to an art fair and if there was another potter at the art fair,
        you\u2019d hardly ever spend any time with your own pots. You\u2019d just
        spend time talking to other people. \u201cHow did you get that color?\u201d
        \u201cHow do you fire?\u201d \u201cHow do you this?\u201d \u201cWhat kind
        of kiln do you have?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your clay formula?\u201d People
        were really generous. We all were, in both directions. The whole thing was
        building fairly rapidly. I never really thought of it as any kind of pioneering,.
        It\u2019s just like, Well, if there aren\u2019t potters, I\u2019ll just invent
        that person. I didn\u2019t want to be a teacher. Nothing against teachers,
        I just I had no passion for that idea. I really wanted to be this independent,
        in my own space, telling my own truth on my own terms.\nAW: That you were
        able to build that in a place where there weren\u2019t a lot of examples is
        really a testament to being resilient in your sense of self and sense of direction.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n8\n00:35:00\nRB:
        Yeah, when you\u2019d find someone it was just like a miracle: Wow, somebody
        else. Then it became more common; then you realize that there\u2019s probably
        some kind of cultural phenomenon happening here. I think it was the Vietnam
        War that, you know, people were waking up\u2014I was born in 1947 and so the
        Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\u2014I don\u2019t know if you ever read that
        book or not, and there was movie by that title\u2014that was kind of the world
        that you were going to inherit. Then there was the movie of The Graduate,
        where the guy takes Dustin Hoffman aside and says, \u201cLet me give you some
        advice,\u201d and he said: \u201cPlastic.\u201d I think that was the world
        that we were supposed to inherit and I think a lot of people thought, Nope,
        I\u2019m not going to inherit that world; I don\u2019t want any part of it.
        You know, most people did but it was just\u2014to me, it was an offer of money,
        and 2.3 children, and a house in suburbia. I just wanted to explore some other
        paths, and if I ended up getting to the house in suburbia and the 2.3 children,
        that would have been fine too. I would have had no problem with that, but
        I would like to have done that on my terms, as well.\nAW: Some of the tension
        in your family that you had mentioned\u2014was it also around the Vietnam
        War or was it mainly focused around your decision to choose pottery?\nRB:
        I think it was both. My father was a career military guy\u2014you know, National
        Guard. He was very heroic in World War Two. He was a bombardier pilot and
        he was shot down three times. It was really a big part of his life. And here\u2019s
        his nineteen year old kid is, you know, taking the opposite view. He kind
        of came around. I think the truth started coming out about the war, so he
        was less dismayed about it. My older bother, on the other hand: we never saw
        eye to eye since then. We were actually kind of friends. He had gone off to
        the army and when he came back he seemed like a changed guy. We had never
        been close, but suddenly we were going on double dates and we were having
        fun together. Then, my stance on the war was just unfathomable to him. Also,
        choosing to sneer at my college degree and go off on this path, he just couldn\u2019t
        figure it out.\nAW: So, in two ways you really decided what you valued and
        cared about and moved ahead in that direction. That must have been tough to
        not have the support of your family.\nRB: You know, it just seemed like what
        everybody is supposed to do. You live your own life. I never thought it was
        any of their business. They weren\u2019t funding anything. I respected their
        opinions. I always thought my father was a really smart fellow, and I never
        thought of him as from another generation that just couldn\u2019t fathom our
        generation. My mother was very smart. She was a sweetheart.\nAW: Another thing
        that you said that I thought was interesting for understanding the historical
        context of the time\u2014you said the idea was that people were being pushed
        to want the 2.3 kids and suburban lifestyle, but that wasn\u2019t really the
        lifestyle that your parents had, or was it? You said they came from a working
        class culture. You felt like there was that pressure there, even then, to
        live in the suburban lifestyle?\n00:39:44 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n9\nRB: I felt like it was a pressure, you know, the Man
        in the Grey Flannel Suit sort of view of the world. I think my parents\u2014a
        inner city neighborhood or suburban neighborhood\u2014they were no different
        to them. Having a big gang of kids, you know, that was your job. Not just
        because they were Catholics, I just think that was the norm, you know the
        formula: you get out of school, you get married, you have children, you move
        to a bigger house, try to get a better job, you know, better yourself. But
        even back then, there was a lot more respect for\u2014if somebody were the
        parks keeper or the janitor at the school. There wasn\u2019t this kind of
        pressure like I think there is now to be somebody, a big deal. I think people
        gravitated to where their skills were. To show you how old I am, we had gas
        lights in Kansas City on one street. It was like the last street. It was Sandusky
        Avenue, and there was a lamplighter. There was a guy that, every night, he
        would walk, he had a little ladder he put on his shoulder, and he had a little
        tool, and he would climb this little short ladder and he\u2019d lift up the
        lens and he\u2019d turn the gas off. I think they only had those gas lanterns
        because there were probably only two guys left in the city, you know, they
        were going to let them work until they retired. As soon as those guys retired
        those lamps were probably were electrified. I don\u2019t remember that process
        but I remember walking along with this old guy who was a lamplighter. Everybody
        tells me, \u201cYou just imagined that,\u201d but there were several of us.
        We kind of chased the guy around. We just thought he was a character, and
        we\u2019d follow him down and he\u2019d like light five lamps and then we\u2019d
        leave him alone. We weren\u2019t pestering him; we were just interested. I\u2019ve
        always respected people who did what they wanted to do. I really like people
        that work with their hands. They\u2019re not all wonderful people, but I respect
        it. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to carve a life. I had a friend of mine,
        who is a photographer, and we were at an art fair one time and there was a
        young potter who came into my booth and asked me a question and I got talking
        to him. He wanted to know about one of my glazes and I gave him the formula.
        He walked off and the photographer said, \u201cYou just gave him your formula?\u201d
        And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d And he was there for about an hour, we were
        talking, and another young guy came in and wanted to know my slip formula.
        And I gave it to him. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t get you guys. Potters
        are crazy. Why are you giving away your secrets?\u201d I said, \u201cWell,
        because anytime you recognize somebody by their questions that you know that
        they\u2019ve gone through enough ceramics to ask that question, you know they\u2019ve
        failed miserably a lot, and, so, you respect that because they\u2019re still
        doing it, even though you know they were getting their butt kicked regularly.
        Ceramics just does that to you. If you survive it, you have to respect it.\nAW:
        How so? How does it kick your butt?\nRB: A pot can fail at every point in
        the process. You can drop the pot, you can squeeze it too hard, you can crack
        it, the materials change. I mean, they mine this stuff with shovels\u2014big
        scoops\u2014and you know, small limestone rocks will fall into it and if that
        gets into your clay you fire it, then you put the pot in the kiln and it blows
        the side of the pot out\u2014a little speck of limestone, you know, that you
        couldn\u2019t see with your eye and it\u2019s just enough to ruin\u2014and
        it might ruin all of those pots. You might have an entire month\u2019s worth
        of work just ruined. The glazes\u2014you can mix your glaze slightly wrong
        and you open up the kiln and it\u2019s all blistered because you put too much
        calcium in the glaze. And then there are all the aesthetic failures besides
        the technical failures. It\u2019s just an endless string of failures, and
        you slowly build up a knowledge base where you can avoid most of the failures,
        except the accidental ones. You know in the beginning, any young potter, even
        if they\u2019re not so young, anybody that\u2019s done it for a A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n10\ncouple of years,
        you know they\u2019ve had miserable experiences, as well as fabulous ones\u2014that\u2019s
        why they\u2019re still doing it.\n00:45:33\nAW: And so you want to support
        that initiative.\nRB: Oh, absolutely.\nAW: Let\u2019s get back to those early
        art fairs that you were describing. Where were they?\nRB: They were in Kansas,
        around Kansas City. Later, I started doing shows all over the country. In
        the beginning you kind of did local ones, you know. Actually, back then, a
        lot of shows wouldn\u2019t let crafts in. They were banned. Banned in Boston.
        Most of the big shows wouldn\u2019t allow it. The guy that I apprenticed with
        in Kansas City was the first craftsperson of any ilk who was allowed in the
        Kansas City Plaza Art Fair, which is still a really good art fair. He was
        the very first non two-dimensional, or sculptor, who was allowed in. He broke
        that ceramic barrier. They didn\u2019t have weavers, glass blowers, potters,
        woodworkers\u2014none of those people were allowed. Even photographers weren\u2019t
        even allowed.\nAW: Who was that person?\nRB: James Vandergrift. There were
        shows in Chicago that had these very rigid rules. Even after they allowed
        crafts, if they were functional crafts, they wouldn\u2019t allow those. There
        were a lot of wrestling matches that went on to be able to access the marketplace.
        You know, there were enough that allowed it that you could struggle and make
        a living but\u2014so, I was doing art shows, maybe four or five a year, and
        then after 1978, I was doing fifteen a year, sometimes more. The logistics
        of that are crazy. In order to not do them all here in the Midwest\u2014because
        in the Midwest they\u2019re only going to be in the summer\u2014you had to
        find shows in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Georgia, California, Arizona,
        New Mexico. The other part of that was I got to see the country, and I really
        discovered that I liked being a roadie. Now that I\u2019m sixty-seven, almost,
        I\u2019m a little less fond of doing too much of that. Ten years ago, they
        were adventures. You went out without any guarantee, you know; you\u2019d
        pay the jury fee, then the booth fee, then you\u2019d have to get a hotel.
        By the time that you\u2019d start your engine to go on a trip you might have
        a thousand dollars already spent with no guarantee that there was any reward
        at the end of that trip\u2014you could go and it would rain all weekend, people
        wouldn\u2019t like your work. It was all a guess. I discovered that I liked
        that. I like not knowing it in the studio and I also like not knowing it in
        the economics. I find it interesting. Obviously, it worked out on balance
        that there was enough income to justify it. I know people whose work is so
        remarkable, so rare, that it\u2019s too expensive or too obscure intellectually
        that people just don\u2019t pick up on it. I don\u2019t know how that would
        have affected me if I wasn\u2019t able to evolve an audience for what I did.
        I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know, maybe get a job and then you do this
        on the side. I would hate that, but I know a lot of people that did.\n00:50:02\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n11\nAW: What
        were some of the most adventurous trips that you did? Or maybe the first ones
        you were going across country? Any particular experiences stand out in your
        memory?\nRB: I went to Florida in 1985. It was the first time that I went
        to Florida and I was in the Coconut Grove Art Fair, which was a really big
        deal at the time. You had to set up the show at four-thirty in the morning,
        in the dark; you weren\u2019t even sure if you were in the right location.
        There was nobody there telling you. You just found your number on the street.
        I\u2019m setting up my show and it\u2019s just getting daylight, so it\u2019s
        probably seven-thirty, eight o\u2019clock, and I\u2019ve got my back to the
        street and I started hearing all this commotion, and I turn around and the
        street was full of people, already. The show wasn\u2019t supposed to start
        until ten. There were people behind my booth now looking in my boxes because
        they\u2019re suddenly wanting to buy stuff, and I\u2019m not even remotely
        set up. So I\u2019m taking money and people are just taking pots out of boxes
        and saying, \u201cHow much is this?\u201d \u201cThis is twenty-five dollars,
        fifty, dollars, whatever,\u201d then handing me money and walking away without
        even wrapping it. By the end of that day I had four pots on one table left,
        and I was just out of breath the whole time. It was like I had been attacked
        by a bunch of crows. It was just amazing. Things like that happen.\nAW: You
        were describing that kind of friendly camaraderie in the early art fairs\u2014did
        that continue?\nRB: Yeah, but I think now there is a little bit of standoffishness
        when people think they have a style or something that they don\u2019t want
        somebody copying. There isn\u2019t much of it, at least not in pottery; there\u2019s
        very little of it. It got more professional, and in a way that made it less
        charming. Some of the people that came into it later on I think became more
        entitled, may be the right word, you know; they\u2019d be grumpy after the
        first three hours. I learned a long time ago with art fairs and with just
        being a potter trying to make a living, you kind of base it on a year. There\u2019s
        going to be three failures in a row and then you\u2019re going to have some
        success. Over the years, you just wait it out. I rarely have any pots left
        at the end of the year.\nAW: So something\u2019s working right.\nRB: Yeah,
        something\u2019s working okay. So, if it\u2019s not starting out right, the
        first day of an art fair, just wait until tomorrow. Even if the thing is a
        disaster, you go home and your truck is still full of pots. I\u2019m totally
        confident that those pots are already sold, I just haven\u2019t figured out
        where yet. It feels like a waste of time when you go out and have a disaster,
        but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not real philosophical about
        it. I don\u2019t get twitchy about it. If a show, the management, if they
        do a really terrible job\u2014if they don\u2019t advertise, or if they are
        rude to the artists\u2014I\u2019m not happy about that. But they\u2019re kind
        of a blast. It\u2019s just I\u2019m getting older and they are more work now,
        but if I were young I\u2019d do them again.\nAW: What was so fun about them
        when you were younger?\nRB: Well, I like to eat and drink. I\u2019d always
        have a cooler full of beer at the booth. I\u2019m not saying I was drunk all
        day\u2014I wasn\u2019t, because you couldn\u2019t be\u2014but you know you\u2019d
        have a little party all the time. People would come by, the customers you\u2019d
        party with, and you\u2019d make it social. At night you\u2019d go out with
        all your friends, you know, restaurant-ing and hanging out at a A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n12\nbar and telling all
        your day\u2019s stories. What did people say to you? What was the most ridiculous
        question you were asked today? They were fun. You made a lot of friends. I
        had a group of friends here and I had a group of friends on the road. It was
        fun to run into them, and we found great restaurants out on the road\u2014we
        were really good at it, finding good places to eat. It also helps you learn
        to cook, you know, ask the chef, \u201cHey, how did you make that?\u201d\n00:55:30\nAW:
        Would you often do that?\nRB: Sure, absolutely. Ask the waiter, \u201cCan
        I talk to the chef?\u201d Then a guy comes out. \u201cThis was a fabulous
        meal. You mind telling me how you did it?\u201d Then he\u2019d go, \u201cThe
        secret is, you know, I use red wine to deglaze the pain and blah, blah blah.\u201c
        You just get little tips and techniques and stuff, you know\u2014it was fun.
        Ann Arbor was a particularly good town because it was a good show, the sale
        was good, and there were five, six, seven really remarkably good restaurants
        there that you would look forward to eating at every year. As soon as you
        got into Ann Arbor it was like, Oh, I think I\u2019ll go to the Earl. I even
        knew what I was going to order. The only place that you can get sweetbreads.
        I\u2019ve never seen them on a menu since.\nAW: You mentioned earlier that
        you really liked cooking, and you were thinking about opening up a bakery,
        you have these interests overlapping\u2014maybe the cooking and making stuff
        with your hands, and the chemistry in creating ceramics and--\nRB: I think
        the dot connecting between food and pots is perfect. I like to have parties.
        I like to go to parties. I like to bring food to parties. I like to have food
        brought here. There\u2019s all this community around eating. There was a woman\u2014Harriet
        Cohen\u2014wrote this one sentence that completely defined my view of pots,
        \u201cCooking, displaying and sharing food is the last ritual left to modern
        man. Being a potter sets you right in the middle of that ritual.\u201d I thought,
        Boy, all the time you struggle to tell people why you make pots and there
        it is in one sentence.\nAW: You really emphasize the social aspects that you
        really like. Do you think that makes you unique, or do you think that potters
        often are social, or are there a mixture of personalities?\nRB: I think you
        can be a completely good potter and be misanthropic. I particularly like people.
        I like visitors. I like talking to my customers. We have a big fire pit, and
        we try to have as many fires as possible. Last night we were at a winery up
        the road here and they were having celebrate spring night for their friends,
        and we sat around the fire and it was fabulous. There\u2019s something about
        a little bit of alcohol, a little bit of food, and a fire that just gets people
        talking to each other. It was funny. There were lots of good political conversations.
        It was great.\nAW: Well great. That gets us transition back to how and why
        you came to Minnesota. You were in Kansas City and looking for a new place.
        Can you walk us through your decision making to come to Minnesota?\nRB: When
        I lived out in Colorado, I was trying to set up a studio and I found an empty
        three-car garage that this guy owned. I fixed the roof. It was kind of in
        shabby condition. I insulated it and A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n13\nfixed it up. He bought the materials and I did all
        the labor. I set up my studio in there and I was there for a month and then
        he said, \u201cOh, you know what? I found somebody to rent this place for
        more money than you\u2019re willing to.\u201d So he kicked me out. And then
        that happened again. When I got to Kansas City, I thought, I got to buy a
        piece of land somewhere. Again, I don\u2019t mean to overemphasize this independence
        thing, but I thought, You know what? I got to be in a reliable place. I bought
        160 acres up by Little Falls and it was big enough that I wouldn\u2019t have
        to deal with the county, the city, the neighbors, whatever. I didn\u2019t
        ever want to have to move a pottery studio again, which I\u2019ve actually
        done two more times since then. They\u2019re horrible to move. You\u2019ve
        got all of that equipment and it\u2019s heavy. I just wanted to get someplace
        where I could just lay down roots. I figured I could live anywhere and it
        wouldn\u2019t matter, I\u2019d make that work. I\u2019ve always believed that
        I can make friends wherever I go, so coming into a strange community was no
        big deal. There\u2019s another more negative side to that is that by being
        an independent potter, you\u2019re not as dependent upon a community because
        you\u2019re not employed there, you\u2019re not running for office there\u2014all
        those things\u2014so you can be kind of aloof, as well. Most of the income
        I\u2019ve made over my life has not been in the community that I\u2019ve lived
        in. In a way, I always thought that that was kind of liberating but at the
        same time it didn\u2019t connect me to my community nearly as much as if you
        belonged to a church or if you owned a business and employed people and that
        kind of stuff. Those are the two sides of the view. So you form friendships
        and communities in other ways.\n01:01:32\nAW: How did you that when you moved
        to Little Falls? [Interview break] Resuming again, you were just about to
        tell us about the food co-op in Little Falls.\nRB: Little Falls was a really
        funny town that I knew nobody in, but I went into the food co-op because I
        like good quality food and a lady that was there said, \u201cWho are you?
        You\u2019re new in town.\u201d And said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re having
        a board meeting tonight. You should come over to our board meeting and get
        to know everybody.\u201d I went to the board meeting, and I got put on the
        board that night. They didn\u2019t know anything about me. [Laughs].\nAW:
        From \u201cWho are you?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d to \u201cJoin
        our board.\u201d [Laughs].\nRB: Right, so there were just some wonderful people
        who became lifelong friends. There were a couple of crafts people that I met
        through that who were also involved in it. There was also a town deli a block
        from the food co-op that were also members of the co-op. These two women that
        ran the town deli were ex-nuns. They called me up one time and said, \u201cWould
        you make us plates and bowls and cups?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d When
        I delivered them, I said, \u201cWhat I would like to do,\u201d\u2014I wanted
        to pull a scam here\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll give you all these pots in exchange
        for you selling my pots here in the delicatessen.\u201d They had shelving
        on the walls and they said, \u201cSure.\u201d I gave them all kinds of plates,
        bowls, cups\u2014whatever they wanted\u2014and then I\u2019d bring them a
        box of pots and they\u2019d put them up on display and they\u2019d sell them.
        Whenever I came into town they\u2019d give me an envelope full of cash, or
        checks and stuff. It kept me alive for two or three years because I wasn\u2019t
        doing a lot of art fairs then. I was actually just trying to establish studio
        then. That was another connection into the community was through those two
        women. They had a lot of people in the circle and then through the food co-op.
        And then I like taverns; taverns are sort of my A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n14\nchurch. I like beer and I like hanging
        out in taverns. So, local taverns near up by where my studio was. I got in
        a pool league\u2014I like to shoot pool. So, you start meeting people.\nAW:
        You said the food co-op folks were friendly. Did you find that people in general
        were friendly and open to newcomers?\nRB: Yeah, when I was building the studio
        there\u2014it was a pretty good-size building. It was seventy-five by thirty.
        I had built the rafters myself, the tresses, but, you know, are really heavy.
        My next door neighbor had come by one day to see what the hell was going on,
        who was building over here. He was being really nosy but he was a really nice
        guy. He had found out the day that we were going to be hoisting these rafters
        up and he brought seven guys over, and they helped us lift those rafters into
        place. As soon as they were nailed into place they all just headed out and
        that was the end of that. It was really wonderful.\nAW: Sounds like a barn
        raising.\nRB: It was, it was. They didn\u2019t know me. I started helping
        them in hay fields and run their cattle from their north pasture to their
        south pasture. There were some dairy farmers around that had some kids that
        were just a little bit younger than we were, so we\u2019d kind of hang out.
        It was a good neighborhood.\n01:05:30\nAW: You moved here with your first
        wife?\nRB: Mm-hmm. We got divorced in 1985, and I moved to Minneapolis. We
        kept that place until we sold it. I moved to Minneapolis. She met somebody
        else and got a life going. They\u2019re married still. My current wife, Mary
        Everett, was living in Minneapolis. She had lived in Little Falls. We knew
        each other from the food co-op. We were on the board together and found out
        we were both in Minneapolis and started hanging out. It was a new relationship.\nAW:
        How long were you in Minneapolis?\nRB: Four years.\nAW: And did you practice
        pottery there? Did you have a studio there? How was that experience different?\nRB:
        Oh, yes. It was remarkably different. I was shocked at how different it as.
        The city was such a distraction, in good ways and bad ways. You had to really
        be disciplined in the city to stay at work all day because there was so much
        going on, you know: restaurants, bars, people everywhere. Just walking down
        the street was a distraction. I like to work too, you know, but it opened
        up other things. I got on the board of the Minnesota Craft Council and got
        involved with that community. That studio was kind of a magnet for a lot of
        people. It had been around for a while. When I moved in there were three women
        working there and there was an existing kiln, and I built a kiln in there.
        That was really a good time for me. I think I experimented a lot more A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n15\naesthetically, in
        terms of form and, you know, all of that stuff. There was lots of experimentation
        going on. It was about the same time that I started doing farther reaching
        art fairs. I think it helped build some reputation at that time. Little Falls
        is kind of the edge of the universe. We\u2019d start having sales at the studio
        with a group of people. It got to be fun. Doing more art fairs around the
        Twin Cities, building an audience that way. It was shocking: the urban artists
        were different than the country artists. I mean, there was more competition,
        there was a little more wariness\u2014not a lot\u2014it wasn\u2019t debilitating
        by any means, but there was more of it, more competitive. It was all right,
        I like competition.\nAW: Did you find the same sense of community there?\nRB:
        Yeah, there was. It was more based on the intellectual side rather than the
        lifestyle side. A fellow named Duke Klassen, who\u2019s a jeweler in Minneapolis,
        he and I are friends\u2014and we started something called Third Thursdays.
        We would meet at Knickerbockers\u2019 Bar on the third Thursday of every month.
        It was no invitation; it was just open to everybody. We would have thirty,
        forty, fifty people come to that. Sometimes it would only be eight or ten
        of us. But it got to be a real powerful vehicle for meeting people; it was
        a lot of fun. We really enjoyed it. Then people started kind of\u2014they
        didn\u2019t like coming to taverns\u2014so we decided to take it underground,
        just to get rid of the whining. We didn\u2019t make it invitational but we
        sort of had a phone tree. But, the third Thursday idea, they do that up in
        Duluth now, the craftspeople up there\u2014Duluth and along the North Shore.
        They\u2019ve really made it work. It\u2019s really amazing. They get a hundred
        people sometimes. It\u2019s all potluck and they do it at somebody\u2019s
        house each month, the third Thursday of the month. They really made it successful.
        We had it successful for a while, but because we had a penchant for doing
        it in taverns, then a lot of people didn\u2019t come. I didn\u2019t want to
        do it in somebody\u2019s house because then there is formalities, you know,
        people have to clean and dress up and, What do you bring? What do you don\u2019t
        bring? When do you leave? When is too early to get there or too late? At a
        tavern, you just walk in, have a beer, leave, stay all night, whatever. But,
        it caused the demise of our third Thursday. (Laughs) That was fine, too. We
        still do it, actually, but we don\u2019t call it Third Thursday; sometimes
        we have it on Wednesday. We just call a bunch of people up and they call a
        bunch of people up and we meet. Now we\u2019re meeting at Manning\u2019s Bar
        and Grill over by Como. Yeah, it\u2019s fun.\n01:11:30\nAW: Where in Minneapolis
        were you living at the time?\nRB: We lived in \u201cNordeast\u201d before
        it was popular. We lived on Quincy between Spring and Summer. We could walk
        to work. Mary worked at RealiaStar Insurance, which then was Northwestern
        National Life Insurance Company. She worked there, which was about a block
        and a half from my studio. Do you know where Origami is? Do you know where
        that restaurant is? Well, they\u2019re in that building and then there was
        an alley and then there was our building, which is now the Federal Reserve
        Bank. On the corner was Berman Buckskin. It was a red brick four-story building,
        a beautiful building. Mr. Berman owned the alley between the two buildings
        we were in. I got there at six-thirty in the morning and that\u2019s when
        he got there. One day the kiln room door was open, and he walked in and wanted
        to know about what was going on there. I made coffee for him. He would show
        up pretty much every day for coffee. There were three A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n16\nNative American guys living in
        the back parking lot in a Ford Falcon station wagon, and they would come in
        for coffee every morning. It was just a nice little spot. But he informed
        me that the city was getting ready to take that block out and we probably
        had a year. So here I am moving another pottery studio. So that\u2019s when
        we bought this place. My wife, Mary, said, \u201cI\u2019ll go one hour. I\u2019ll
        drive one hour to work.\u201d So we drew a circle around Minneapolis and then
        we would go\u2014we\u2019d spend the night in like, Welch, Minnesota, and
        then we\u2019d drive in the morning in rush hour traffic. We were just trying
        to see what would be the best route. We did that in all four quadrants and
        this quadrant was the easiest. Then we found this place, and we liked it a
        lot. We built this house. There was nothing here but a horse pasture.\nAW:
        Then you have this house here and the studio and then what\u2019s over there?\nRB:
        Yeah, when she quit her job she wanted to build a building\u2014she wanted
        to start a business out here. She wanted to build a building herself. She
        hired a carpenter and they built that building together. She was going to
        run a small business\u2014a kind of advisory business, you know, taxes and
        government regulations and human resource stuff. She would do that for small
        businesses, but then a non-profit hired her to be their financial manager
        and so she did that for a while. She never used that building, so it turned
        into my showroom and a garage\u2014it\u2019s a warehouse. Upstairs is kind
        of a like bunkhouse when we do the Tour all the helpers\u2014there are like
        six beds up there.\nAW: Was there anything else you wanted to add on that?
        Setting up a studio in an urban place like Northeast, or in a rural area\u2014when
        you knew you wanted to move a third time did you know that you wanted to go
        back to somewhere in the country? What was the experience like setting up
        your studio in Minneapolis?\n01:15:20\nRB: It was easy. There was already
        an approved gas meter and a gas line. There was a big gas line for the kiln
        that was there. It had been approved like twenty years before. It was kind
        of a neighborhood nobody was paying attention to. You could kind of do whatever
        you wanted. Building a kiln in an urban\u2014back then was really difficult
        because you were sort of lumped in with nuclear power plants in terms of risk
        factors. It was really hard to get permission. So that was nice because there
        was an existing, approved gas meter. It\u2019s very difficult. That\u2019s
        why people end up spending a lot of time at Northern Clay Center and Fired
        Up and those places because they can\u2019t have access to gas kilns except
        for those places. There are exceptions. But out here, it\u2019s nothing. Nobody
        cares, other than the insurance company. But the county, you know, they\u2019re
        interested in how you build your building. They don\u2019t care what you put
        in it, unless it was some kind of hazardous chemicals. So this was an attempt
        at one final\u2014although, now we\u2019re going to sell.\nAW: Oh really?\nRB:
        Yeah.\nAW: Are you going to build a new studio again? A Measure of the Earth

        it\u2019s really a problem. We\u2019re going to move to the city again. I\u2019m
        going to find some kind of studio. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going
        to do that, but--\nAW: --Wow, that seems like a big change. So, you moved
        in here when?\nRB: Eighty-eight.\nAW: So from \u201988 to now, that\u2019s
        quite a long time you\u2019ve been here.\nRB: Twenty-six years. So my agreement
        with my wife is that we will host the pottery tour until the twenty-fifth
        anniversary. So we think we have a young potter to buy the house in two years.
        That\u2019s faster than we had planned, but it also fits our timeline better.
        They\u2019ll become the host of the Tour when they take over and I\u2019ll
        just be the guest. That\u2019ll be great.\nAW: Must be tough to leave here.\nRB:
        Extremely, but she did this for me. Now I\u2019m doing the reverse. She didn\u2019t
        want to live here. She did it for my benefit. She will have done it for twenty-eight
        years; that\u2019s a lot.\nAW: You have built a wonderful building over there
        with the bunkhouse\u2014you can come and be there. You\u2019ll never be just
        a guest, I have a feeling. This will always be your home.\nRB: Yeah, she\u2019s
        liked it out here. We\u2019ve made friends out here and she likes them, but
        she wants to get closer to libraries, and bookstores, and universities. I
        like the urban scene, too. I\u2019ve probably spent most of my life in the
        country, but I like cities. I have no problem with it\u2014other than there\u2019s
        a lot of beauty here.\nAW: There is. This is a really beautiful piece of land
        you have here.\nRB: Yeah, but we\u2019ll make it work. I\u2019m happy to do
        it. In fact, it will be another adventure.\nAW: That\u2019s a really good
        attitude to have towards it.\nRB: Yeah, I just want to keep making pots. I\u2019ve
        got to find a studio. And I\u2019ll find that.\nAW: While you\u2019ve been
        here have you maintained connections with Twin Cities'' potters? Has that
        been relatively easy to do? Or challenging at times?\nRB: Yeah, for the first
        few years we lived out here we were probably in Minneapolis entirely for our
        social\u2014maybe for ten years we were going in there once a week, maybe,
        sometimes more. We go to a lot of theater and music\u2014\nAW: \u2014Oh, I

        for third Thursdays?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n18\n01:20:00\nRB:
        There was one across from the old Metrodome. It was called Knickerbockers\u2019
        and it changed two or three times. I don\u2019t know what it is now. We tried
        Gluek\u2019s downtown; we did that for a while. Where else? We\u2019ve had
        it at about five different places. We had it at the Sample Room one time;
        that wasn\u2019t a good idea. I mean, the Sample Room was great, I liked everything
        about that place, it just wasn\u2019t good for a group of twenty people who
        were just going to be there hanging out. You need a somewhat neighborhood
        tavern kind of place.\nAW: Ok. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. You were saying
        about staying connected there?\nRB: Most of our friends are in the Twin Cities
        still, yeah, craftspeople.\nAW: Your wife\u2014did she also do some crafts?\nRB:
        No, no. I think she thinks that there is a virus in clay, and if you get too
        close to it too often, then you quit everything else in your life and you
        just start doing pottery. She doesn\u2019t want to do that. She\u2019s seen
        the obsession.\nAW: That\u2019s pretty amazing about your relationship that
        she supported that obsession even as you have supported her.\nRB: Yeah, and
        I think even enjoyed it.\nAW: Sometimes it can be hard in a relationship if
        someone is---there\u2019s time there where you\u2019re setting up your studio,
        building an audience, getting regular support for your art\u2014and if a partner
        is not in the arts scene, is in a different field\u2014I was wondering if
        you had any reflections on that?\nRB: I don\u2019t know if we have good balance
        or not\u2014I think it\u2019s probably been mostly weighted in my favor\u2014but
        we spend a lot of time together. We both like theater and we like music and
        so we find lots to do together. She\u2019s an avid book reader, and I will
        be, when I get back.\nAW: Tierney is, too, which is why I looked at Tierney.\nTM:
        Yeah, there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m a history major.\nRB: My wife just recently
        quit her job, so she\u2019s now full-time reading. She was always a full-time
        reader. If she\u2019s not in the kitchen, she\u2019s reading books.\nAW: So,
        you each have an obsession?\nRB: I know; it came to a head one time about
        something. She was suggesting that I stop doing something and I said, \u201cWell,
        then would a fair trade be that you stop reading books?\u201d (Laughs).\nAW:

        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n19\nRB: I like to play poker and so I think she was wondering
        if I shouldn\u2019t play poker so much. I don\u2019t play as much as I used
        to.\nTM: Yeah, I see the giant stack of books just sitting right there.\nRB:
        Oh, you should see upstairs. I bet she\u2019s read four books in the last
        three days. Some good, some bad, some trash. I used to be a more avid reader
        but not anymore. I don\u2019t know why\u2014too busy, too tired.\nAW: When
        you were in Minneapolis in the eighties you were experimenting a lot with
        different styles. Can you tell us more about what you were experimenting with?\nRB:
        Right about then I was on the board of the Minnesota Craft Council. I was
        the Vice President and the Vice President\u2019s job was to put on the annual
        meeting. We decided to have the annual meeting in Duluth one year, and it
        was my job to get all the speakers and organize the whole thing. Nobody would
        help me, so I thought, Ok, what do I want to hear? I thought one of the things
        that always plagues craftspeople is that they tend to work alone. So I organized
        three speakers to address the idea of how do you stay motivated working alone?
        It was great. We had Walter Nottingham, was the main guy. He spoke on making
        fewer choices\u2014having fewer things you bring into your artistic life to
        make decisions about. He had this wonderful slide show of fifteen artists
        that had gone to school with him\u2014fiber artists; he was a fiber professor.
        He had followed their careers after they had left his tutelage. They had all
        chosen something early on to focus on, you know, really narrow. He showed
        them their slides, their progression as artists, having chosen narrowly, how
        it expanded their creative horizons, and he said, \u201cListen, when you\u2019re
        in your studio and you\u2019re doing something you like to do and you feel
        good about yourself when you\u2019re doing it, then just do that a lot. It\u2019s
        not complicated.\u201d I went home from that meeting, and two other people
        in the studio where I worked were there at the meeting, as well. We all had
        completely different opinions about what he meant by narrowing your choices.
        He kept saying, \u201cListen, the thing you need to do is do it for yourself.\u201d
        It took me about three months, but I sorted out that what I did for myself
        was ash glazes. Whenever I had a pot that I really liked in a certain way,
        I would put ash glazes on it. Couldn\u2019t sell them. They were just your
        favorite pots and\u2014the ash glaze was impossible to sell. Thinking about
        it, I thought, If I\u2019m going to do it for myself, then I need to make
        the kind of pots that will work with the ash glazes because that\u2019s what
        I really liked. So, I did. I quit doing everything else and I started experimenting
        with form and stuff that would work with these ash glazes that I had invented.
        I got destroyed, financially; I mean, I couldn\u2019t give them away. For
        two years I was just going into debt. I would go off to art fairs and I\u2019d
        think I had these beautiful pots, and nobody would buy them. Then, I got a
        handle on the aesthetic and\u2014it was like in the beginning when you were
        smitten with pottery and now I\u2019m smitten with this idea. I know it\u2019s
        a really good idea, it\u2019s the right direction, and then it started to
        work. Then it really took off. I could really explore. So, long explanation.\n01:27:56\nAW:
        Can you tell us more about the ash glaze and why you used them? A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n20\nRB: The ash glazes
        are a couple thousand years old. The Chinese Han Dynasty used them. They kind
        of fell into disfavor. They\u2019re kind of runny. They can ruin a lot of
        your pots because they just run; if you don\u2019t handle it right, they ruin
        the kiln shelves. There are a lot of reasons people quit using them. But it\u2019s
        just natural wood ash from a fireplace. I kind of like that and that you can
        mix simple ingredients with them and you can make these really wonderful materials.
        I figured out a way to make them so they weren\u2019t quite so runny, and
        they were actually matte surfaces more than bright shiny surfaces, which I
        didn\u2019t like. Then I discovered the application of slips, so I invented
        a slip that I could put on bisque ware\u2014which is a really backwards way
        of doing it\u2014and it worked great with the ash glazes. Suddenly I was able
        to explore surface texture, surface color, surface of contrasts. They started
        to integrate with the pots better. The pot forms that I like to make and the
        surfaces that I put on them now made sense together. I would probably be arrogant
        to say this, but I probably single-handedly re-started ash glazes, you know;
        people just had quit doing them. They hadn\u2019t been done for decades. I
        would find other people doing them now and then when I was out and about.
        Then, ten years later, I was at a show in Kansas City and there were nine
        people doing ash glazes there at that show. And I thought, Wow, this has really
        changed, you know, because there was nobody. It was really funny how quickly
        it changes.\n01:30:08\nAW: Why do you think ash glaze became more popular?\nRB:
        I think people see them and see that they like them. They hadn\u2019t seen
        them before. They\u2019ve heard about them, but they don\u2019t know about
        them; they\u2019ve never tried them. So they see them and they like it, so
        they want to explore that. Other people see somebody having some success with
        something and they angle in that direction. Porcelain came about early 1980s\u2014boy,
        just herds of people ran to porcelain. It was trendy, and some people did
        it well, some people didn\u2019t do it well. The ones that weren\u2019t doing
        it well they were just doing it because it was a trend. The ones that did
        it well, they made something fabulous out of it. I think the same thing happened
        with Raku. Whenever there\u2019s any of these changes that happens, whenever
        there\u2019s any new innovation, there\u2019s a huge movement towards it.
        And then the residue is five or ten percent become masterful at it, and everybody
        else are just kind of charlatans and then they drop out or move on to something
        else. If you do this long enough you can see these circles that happen, cycles
        of trends that come and go.\nAW: How would you describe the work that you
        were doing when you first started? What style were you working in or how would
        you define that?\nRB: I think it was related to the first guy I apprenticed
        with\u2014early American, heavy, chunky stoneware. I don\u2019t think they
        were pure early American, nor were they pure mimics of this guy, but they
        had that feel\u2014heavy duty, thick rims, thick handles\u2014just utilitarian
        pots. That evolved over time. Actually, I think my first wife, I think we
        were driven more by her aesthetic, for years. I don\u2019t think I had a real
        good concept of what I wanted to do. I just wanted to make pots, and make
        beautiful pots. She had a pretty distinct idea of what she wanted to do. I
        think we both followed down her aesthetic path. A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n21\nAW: How would you define that?\nRB:
        It was really earthy glazes, really simple pot forms, pretty straightforward.
        She was really influenced by\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say Scandinavian modern,
        but that kind of contemporary modern design in the Sixties, real clean. There
        wasn\u2019t a lot of elaboration. We were using glazes that were fairly common
        in the day, limestone matte glazes. They\u2019re beautiful. They\u2019re still
        my favorite glazes. They\u2019re just lush, smooth; they feel good to the
        touch. They\u2019re a little bit like latex wall paint except with more warmth
        to it. It was just simple, nice stuff, which I like, simple.\nAW: How did
        things change after you were experimenting with ash glaze? Was that the next
        big change?\nRB: That was the key change and the use of ash and slip together.
        I decided that what I didn\u2019t want to do was make perfect pots. I had
        no desire to make refined work. I wanted to make pretty crude, coarse, but
        controlled. I started making more explorations into loosening up the form
        range and how I would let the forms just evolve organically and not try to
        push it in any kind of perfection. I think I\u2019ve slid a little bit back
        towards being more skillful but not completely, not every part of it. As much
        as I value skill and craftsmanship, it can be a trap, too. It can be a trap
        of feeling that that\u2019s enough, and that\u2019s not enough. I call it
        vacuous virtuosity, when you can be really good at something but there\u2019s
        no voice in it.\n01:35:20\nAW: How would you define your style? The kind of
        pottery you make today?\nRB: I\u2019ve always tried to find the right word.
        I would like them to be moving towards primitive, but I feel like I don\u2019t
        quite pull the trigger on that. I take it part of the way there. It\u2019s
        halfway to primitive. It\u2019s loose, it\u2019s organic, but it still pulls
        in those things that I did when I first started: chunky rims and fat handles,
        weighty.\nAW: Why do you make what you make?\nRB: I make it because it\u2019s
        useful. I\u2019m a part of that process I talked about\u2014the ritual. The
        funny compliments that you get and one of them is when somebody says, \u201cYou
        know, your soup bowls that we own, they\u2019re either on the table or in
        the dishware,\u201d which tells you that they use them everyday. That\u2019s
        really pleasant: to make something that people choose as their favorite thing
        that they have to have their food in. A guy once told me, \u201cYou know,
        when we got divorced, the only argument we had were about your pots,\u201d
        and it was because they had used them everyday. He was back buying some pots
        because he lost the argument. One of the best treats you ever have to is to
        go into a stranger\u2019s house\u2014you\u2019re invited to a party or something\u2014and
        there are your pots on the table. They don\u2019t even know you made them.
        That\u2019s really cool: that you\u2019re anonymous and you\u2019re at this
        event and this person that you don\u2019t know found your work somewhere and
        they\u2019re using it, and they thought enough of it that they put it out
        on this table for their community, their friends.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n22\nAW: Has that happened to you?\nRB:
        Yeah, a few times.\nAW: Did you talk to the person?\nRB: No, I wanted to leave
        that undone because it changes the relationship. Later you can talk about
        it but--\nAW: --Well, that would be really amazing to show up and see that.\nRB:
        It is. So that\u2019s why you make them. One of the potters on the Tour, Will
        Swanson, he said something really profound a few years ago. I like these one-sentence
        explanations. We were talking about notoriety and the importance of it or
        non-importance of it. He said, \u201cAll I know is that I want to be notable
        in the cupboard,\u201d meaning that you\u2019re the person when they open
        the door that they sort through all the coffee cups to get to yours. I thought
        that was meaningful. That says what you\u2019re about.\nAW: Well, thank you.
        I think that helps clarify more about the style and type of pottery that you\u2019re
        making and why you make it.\nRB: When you\u2019re making something you sit
        down with some food in mind\u2014How would this be used?\u2014if you\u2019re
        making a new object. What am I making this for? How will this enter the world
        as opposed to being put behind glass in a cupboard. Is it too big? Is it too
        little? Could it hold a salad and salad for how many? Would this be a good
        Thanksgiving mashed potato bowl? You think about all that stuff when you\u2019re
        making it.\n01:40:03\nAW: And then how great to show up to someone\u2019s
        party and see it being used in that way. Have there ever been times that you\u2019ve
        shown up and stuff has been used in an unusual way or you\u2019ve seen it
        behind glass?\nRB: Oh sure, always, I mean that happens too much, but it\u2019s
        fine. People have to store it somewhere. As long as it\u2019s not precious.\nAW:
        Is that approach to pottery something common nowadays for a lot of potters
        or is that an unusual approach?\nRB: I think it\u2019s actually more prevalent
        in Minnesota. I think there is a little more of that ethic of things being
        accessible and useful, and part of it is price. I mean, if things are too
        expensive, they become precious. That\u2019s kind of the legacy of Warren
        MacKenzie, a little bit. I wouldn\u2019t put it all on him because I think
        I had that philosophy, as well, and I think others do, but he defined it as
        a Minnesota cultural thing. There are other places where that\u2019s true,
        too, but here a lot more people are practicing making pots to be used, in
        all its real meaning. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s just a useful A Measure

        you think that developed here or in St. Croix River Valley community?\nRB:
        I think because of Warren MacKenzie. He defined that culture decades ago,
        you know: of being accessible and having things stay out of the glass cabinet.\nAW:
        But you said you were practicing that before you came to Minnesota?\nRB: Mm
        hmm. And the guy I apprenticed with was of that ilk. My second apprenticeship,
        they were the opposite. They were more, These are art objects and they\u2019re

        do you also see this approach to pottery as useful pottery?\nRB: It\u2019s
        here and there, potter by potter, as opposed to region. I think there are
        some in North Carolina, but there\u2019s such a big pottery community there
        that it has to surface. It\u2019s actually sneered at a lot: that Minnesota
        is holding down the ceramic economic values. I dispute that but--\nAW: --Where
        is that argument coming from?\nRB: People that just have been trained differently.
        I just had that argument a week ago in Washington, D.C., with a young potter\u2014made
        beautiful work\u2014but she\u2019s not making functional pots. She thought
        that cheap functional pots were really suppressing the market. That\u2019s
        just not true; it\u2019s not even remotely true, at any level. She just thought,
        \u201cWell, you know that not putting proper prices on it just devalues it.\u201d
        I go, \u201cSorry, I disagree. People who are going to buy your work, the
        way you project it, are not the people who are going to buy my work. I\u2019m
        not affecting the people that buy your work. They\u2019re two different universes.\u201d
        They can exist at the same time, that\u2019s what I think people don\u2019t
        believe. I just think everybody develops their own audiences. Sometimes you
        have to go farther away to find them.\nAW: So, finding your audience here,
        let\u2019s get back to that. When you first arrived in Little Falls, were
        there many potters here? Was there a sense of a pottery community?\nRB: I
        can almost name them\u2014there was Warren MacKenzie, Wayne Branum, Mark Pharis,
        Janel Jacobson, Linda Christianson. Jeff Oestreich, John Coiner, Peter (??)
        that was about it. Oh, there was Peter Leach. These were people that were
        doing it for a serious level; they weren\u2019t working another job and doing
        it, this was their career. I remember early on, the first couple of events
        I went to in Minnesota, people just, \u201cWhat are these?\u201d They didn\u2019t
        fit in any of the categories that existed around here in the culture that
        had already been very established. It was really hard. I had to develop my
        own audience.\n01:45:52\nAW: How do you that? A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n24\nRB: You just keep banging away at it.
        You talk to people that like the work. You get their name and address and
        you invite them to the next event. They bring a friend, and ten people become
        two hundred people become four hundred and suddenly it\u2019s a thousand.
        You do enough events in a region, and, if you pay attention, it may take five
        years but\u2014you do things like have them in the delicatessen. I don\u2019t
        think it\u2019s that complicated, but it\u2019s a lot of diligence. And it\u2019s
        none of the things that you really want to spend your time on. You just want
        to make this stuff. A potter I know, we were talking about what would be your
        favorite way to market your work. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m doing it. I like
        what I\u2019m doing and I think this is great.\u201d And I said, \u201cHow
        about you?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I would just like to make the work,
        fire it, unload the kiln and put it out in the yard, and have someone come
        and write me a check and take it all away.\u201d I think that\u2019s fine
        ,but that\u2019s a person that doesn\u2019t like people and doesn\u2019t want
        to engage in a lot of different personalities. Wants to have fewer people
        in their lives. That\u2019s fine, but I want to have lots of people.\nAW:
        So, you enjoy that part of it\u2014both making it and selling it to someone.\nRB:
        I\u2019ve never thought of myself as the village potter where you\u2019re
        making pots for a specific community. A lot of people try to envision that
        for themselves. I never have. I didn\u2019t mind the road, taking off for
        a strange art fair somewhere. I just think it\u2019s really cool\u2014you
        get to a new community that you\u2019ve never been at, you set your work up
        and people walk down the street and somebody angles over because it kind of
        looks like something they might be interested in, and you see them smile,
        they like it, and then they start talking to you about it and they go, \u201cYou
        know what? I\u2019ve never seen you before, I\u2019ve never seen any work
        like this before, but I have to have that.\u201d You sell it to them and you
        get their name and address, and the next time you\u2019re going to be in Phoenix
        or wherever you send them a card and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to be at blah,
        blah, blah.\u201d You develop audiences all over the place, which we\u2019ll
        get to later, but that\u2019s part of why people are coming to the Tour from
        far, far away is because all of that stuff that people have done in the past,
        you know: nurturing audiences in other places. I think that\u2019s one of
        the secrets we\u2019ve uncovered is that people will travel. They like road
        trips just like I like road trips. They\u2019re passionate collectors and
        so, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wanted to o to Minneapolis,\u201d so
        they come here for the Tour and get a weekend in Minneapolis and go to some
        theater or go to the museum.\nAW: So, people really make it a vacation destination
        here? Where are they coming from?\nRB: Everywhere. You\u2019d be shocked.\nAW:
        List off some of the countries or states?\nRB: We had a guy fly in from London;
        we\u2019ve had a guy from Malaysia; Canada, of course; then Miami, Los Angeles.
        A couple drove here from Bellingham, Washington, bought a bunch of pots, turned
        around and drove home. Regularly, I bet you we have a 100 or more people come
        from Chicago, Milwaukee. They\u2019re coming from Philadelphia and New York.
        It\u2019s really crazy. It\u2019s wonderful. They appear to be having a good
        time, too, so I think we\u2019re doing a good job.\n01:50:32 A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n25\nAW: Why do you think
        so many people come from so many places?\nRB: It\u2019s really good pots.
        I think it\u2019s at first a qualitative issue, and then we have quantities
        of pots. It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s so rare\u2014anytime anybody
        goes to see your work in a gallery or even in an art fair, they\u2019re only
        looking at ten or twenty pieces. Where here, everybody is showing two hundred,
        three hundred, four hundred, five hundred pieces. They get a complete view
        of your ceramic work, and I think that\u2019s been really important. Probably
        in two weeks there will be four thousand pots back here.\nAW: Wow, that\u2019s
        amazing, I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing them.\nRB: There might
        only be three thousand of them on display because you just can\u2019t fit
        them. On the Tour, I\u2019m sure there will be ten thousand pots. There\u2019s
        no other place you can do that. There\u2019s no other experience like that.
        I mean, there are little experiences like that, other people that are doing
        tours and studio sales, but the experience that people have had in the past
        has always been a limited view of your work. Now, they get this expansive
        view of your work. They\u2019re a little overwhelmed when they first see it
        because it\u2019s so much to look at and then they get into it, and it\u2019s
        fun. We did a zip code study the last two years of where people came from.
        Two years ago, it was eighteen percent came more than three hundred miles.
        This year, twenty-three percent came more than three hundred miles. Pretty
        shocking, yeah.\nAW: What were some of the other things you learned from that
        study? How about 150-300 mile range? How much of a percentage were the visitors
        from over one hundred miles?\nRB: It\u2019s almost entirely from Minnesota
        and a little bit western Wisconsin. It\u2019s like eighty percent from Minnesota.
        But then, the other twenty percent is made up from the entire country.\nAW:
        Before we get so into those details\u2014you said when you arrived there were
        a lot of potters in the area. Was there a community, strong relationships
        between potters here in this area?\nRB: Yeah, the ones who knew each other,
        there was, but I didn\u2019t know them.\nAW: Did you meet them when you moved
        into Little Falls or after you came back from Minneapolis?\nRB: I started
        to in art fairs. I don\u2019t think there were any potters up in Little Falls
        at that time. There were two clay artists that lived in Browerville. I played
        volleyball with him\u2014Dan and Lee Ross. Do you know them? They\u2019re
        sculptors, you know, they\u2019re really good. They\u2019re like hidden Minnesota
        gems. They live up on the North Shore now, but they used to live in Browerville;
        now they live up in Hovland. They\u2019re really good. They do stone and clay
        sculpture. They\u2019re really remarkable artists. There are so many little
        hidden\u2014this state is just like\u2014I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve
        ever seen Alice Strand? She does little sewn animals. They get dismissed because
        everybody thinks they\u2019re just cute, but they\u2019re really wonderful
        sculptures. She has a thing called Alice\u2019s Animals; they\u2019re just
        crazy. We have a huge collection of her stuff. There are all these little
        pockets of people around the state that are remarkable craftspeople that I
        got to know over A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n26\nthe
        years. Because they don\u2019t bang the drum, you know, they\u2019re just
        working craftspeople. They just work and make a living from it. They don\u2019t
        sending up any \u201clook at me\u201d flairs. They pay attention to business,
        they pay attention to their customers and stuff, but they\u2019re just remarkably
        good artists.\n01:55:26\nAW: So, you said in Little Falls, there weren\u2019t
        many potters. When you went to Minneapolis did you meet more? Then, when you
        moved to Harris?\nRB: There was an existing bunch here. Janel Jacobson was
        maybe the first. Then Linda Christianson and Jeff Oestreich were here. When
        I bought this place I specifically bought it on this side of I-35 because
        I didn\u2019t want to get in their way, you know, because they had been here
        for a while. I just thought, I wanted to be a good neighbor and not move in
        down the road. But. I knew them. I knew Janel and her husband Will Swanson,
        probably about as well as anybody. Connee Mayeron lived here, but I didn\u2019t
        know Connee. I knew Connee from a couple of art fairs but I didn\u2019t know
        that she lived up in this area. All these people, the potters, have all lived
        here a while and they have all developed their friendships and circles. We
        don\u2019t socialize deeply, you know; we just put on the event together.
        I\u2019m friends with Will and Janel, and Guillermo Cuellar, and Connee Mayeron\u2014Connee
        and I play poker together. She\u2019s a poker nut. Me too.\nAW: What led to
        the development of the Tour?\nRB: Will Swanson and I used to have breakfast
        a couple times a month. We\u2019d just talk about this and that, you know,
        pottery stuff. I said, \u201cWe should have an event here.\u201d Will agreed.
        We were trying to define what that would be. We didn\u2019t want to start
        another art fair\u2014that model is not worn out, but it\u2019s overused.
        So then, Why don\u2019t we have a studio event that has a theme that is Minnesota
        Highway 95. Let\u2019s contact everybody on Highway 95 or within a few miles
        of that and we\u2019ll get a meeting and see if they want to figure out some
        kind of event. We went from Prescott to St. Could. It was obvious that there
        was a cluster right in this area. There were people at either end that didn\u2019t
        want to come or decided it was too far. I was glad because it would have been
        too much of a stretch. We got together somewhere\u2014I don\u2019t remember
        where\u2014and we had a meeting. There wasn\u2019t really a lot of enthusiasm
        for it because everybody was established, and they all had studio sales that
        they had been doing for years and so why interrupt that? I just tried to be
        eloquent and said, \u201cWell look, if we think about the Twin Cities area,
        if we\u2019re being very liberal, there\u2019s probably five thousand people
        of these three million who care at all about ceramics. I think that\u2019s
        a shame. I think we should try to make that fifty thousand. The way we can
        do that is if we get momentum as a group. We could have an event.\u201c Everybody
        was mmm-mm. \u201cWhen would we do it?\u201d We started in October the first
        year, or maybe the first two years. I had a fall sale here in the first weekend
        of October, so we put it on that weekend. Warren MacKenzie was still having
        his fall sale two weeks later, and a couple of people on the Tour were in
        his sale. He was on our tour, too. They just thought it was too much to do
        it two or three weeks apart. After two years, we moved it to the spring, which
        I thought was a bad idea at the time but I was willing to do it because I
        knew the reason. But it turned out it just was a bonus because it became successful
        in the spring. It would have been in the fall but now I could have two sales,
        one in the fall and one in the spring. My fall sale, this is it\u2019s twenty-fifth
        year. We A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n27\nstarted
        it on Mother\u2019s Day weekend. I don\u2019t even know why we picked that,
        it just sounded good. It was ok. We did all right. Some people came, but it
        was nothing overwhelming and nobody was that thrilled about it. But we hung
        together. That was the biggest challenge, actually, was keeping all the people
        on board. There was not dissension, but there was just ho-hum. Then there
        were some wrestling matches about do we do it two days or one day. I refused
        to do it one day, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like treating people that way.
        I don\u2019t want making people have to make all their decisions in one day.\u201d
        Plus, if you\u2019re having a tour, then it\u2019s too hard. We fought that
        battle over the years and kept it at two days and then we added a third, maybe
        twelve years in.\n02:01:37\nAW: Why did you add the third?\nRB: Well, this
        goes back to my economics training. I think part of how you analyze how to
        build an audience is look at the culture you\u2019re in and what people are
        doing\u2014you certainly want to avoid fishing opener, or hunting opener,
        there are just things culturally that are here and are kind of in your way,
        maybe, opening day of the Twins. This is lake country, lake cabins, boating
        and fishing, anytime you look out on Friday, out on I-35 it\u2019s just packed
        with people heading up to the lake. Will and I argued for almost ten years
        to open up on Friday because we felt that a significant part of our population,
        already customers of ours, audience members, they\u2019re heading up in the
        spring to their cabin on the North Shore or wherever, and their coming back
        on Sunday and its done. Finally everyone agreed to do it on Friday and literally
        the show went up forty percent. That was its twelfth year. How does anything
        grow forty percent twelve years in? It\u2019s little things like that of observing
        the community you live in and figuring out what the habits are.\nAW: Did you
        have a lot of banners and advertising? How did you get those folks off of
        I-35?\nRB: Just from our mailing list, that weren\u2019t coming because they
        were already out of town.\nAW: This way they could stop on their way out of
        town.\nRB: There was another little thing that was undiscovered. The first
        year, people would come up to me and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad that
        you did this. I can take a personal day off on Friday, come on the Tour and
        then I have my weekend free.\u201d So, it had that unintended consequence.
        It was little things like that. Another crazy thing, the first nine years
        we had a sepia tone little three-fold piece of paper. It was not real interesting
        but it served its purpose, it got the information out. On the tenth year we
        talked about what could we do special for the tenth anniversary and we came
        up with the idea of having a poster, a big poster in color, which was new.
        The tenth year it doubled from the ninth year, just because of a silly color
        poster.\nAW: The power of advertising.\nRB: I know, but the information hadn\u2019t
        changed, it came in a different package. That just made my jaw drop. Wow,
        is it that simple? Maybe it is.\n02:05:10 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n28\nAW: What were the numbers like in the early years,
        before the color poster? Just a ballpark of how many people would come through
        on the Tour?\nRB: I\u2019m guessing a thousand and maybe it doubled to two
        thousand.\nAW: And then even doubled more when adding the Friday?\nRB: Friday,
        I would say it went from one thousand to two thousand and then it went to
        three thousand when we opened on Friday.\nAW: Now, what is it like now?\nRB:
        Five thousand, and a full seven, eight hundred of them came from beyond three
        hundred miles.\nAW: Are the people who are coming from more than three hundred
        miles, are they return visitors?\nRB: A lot of them are but a lot of them,
        they\u2019ve wanted to do it and they maybe come once every three years. Some
        come every year.\nAW: Do you still go to art fairs and do you see them there?\nRB:
        Yeah, that\u2019s where they found out about it, mostly. I think there\u2019s
        a word of mouth that\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s gotten enough scale that
        people talk about it. We send out posters to art centers and they get posted
        in there and people are taking ceramics classes, you know, they get two or
        three of their ceramics buddies and they jump in a car and drive out here.
        We\u2019ll have seven or eight tents, you know, people pitch tents out here.
        They come in, they don\u2019t want to get a hotel. Now the hotels are filling
        up because of the Tour, though I think a lot of our out of town people stay
        in Minneapolis and come out because they\u2019re doing a lot of other things.
        They\u2019re using the Tour as an excuse to do other things in Minneapolis
        as well.\nAW: In those first couple of years who were the people who attended
        the Tour?\nRB: Local Minneapolis pot lovers.\nAW: When did you start to notice
        that people from out of state and all over the country would come?\nRB: Maybe
        ten or twelve years. We were not even sending out invitations to people outside
        of the area.\nAW: When did that start? You invite artists to show?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n29\nRB: I think we started
        having guests after about the fourth or fifth year. It was supposed to be
        one guest per place, but some people would have five. We\u2019re really run
        extremely loosely. We meet once a year. We don\u2019t have organized meetings.
        We don\u2019t have a board. We meet a week after the Tour, and we assign the
        jobs that are going to be important next year and somebody says, \u201cYeah,
        I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Or I\u2019ll say, \u201cIf you want me to, I\u2019ll
        keep doing the poster, or, blah, blah, blah.\u201d The jobs stay the same
        or somebody says, \u201cI\u2019m tired of it and will somebody else take it
        over?\u201d So we\u2019ve settled into a pattern. We have a marketing committee\u2014it\u2019s
        three of us\u2014which is really just a joke. We just meet at a bar to drink
        a beer, to socialize; I mean, we do talk about the Tour and we get some things
        solved, like how much money we\u2019re going to budget for Minnesota Public
        Radio ads, and once we decide that, we have a beer. It\u2019s really a loosely
        run thing. We have very few rules. Our only rule is that we\u2019ve finally
        settled on that eight is the maximum number of guests you can have. The guests
        have to be here and that they have to be making something in ceramics. That\u2019s
        our rule. We don\u2019t jury; you choose who you want to have, and we like
        that better than having some central deciding thing. Hard feelings if there\u2019s
        somebody you\u2019re proposing and the rest of the group says no. Nobody is
        going to invite someone they don\u2019t have high views of their work. We
        just assume that we\u2019re going to be the highest quality of work, people
        who are serious about it, and we don\u2019t get in anybody\u2019s way. What
        I do here can be whatever I want to do here. We have a pool of money that
        we put together that we require each person to contribute equally to and then
        that\u2019s what we use for marketing, for publishing the poster and the mailing
        and the website. There\u2019s a poster designer person that works with whoever
        is making the poster so we get the right stuff for the printing.\n02:11:06\nAW:
        What are the other jobs?\nRB: There\u2019s a treasurer who everybody pays
        the money to and they pay the bills. We have one person we call the Bulldog,
        and their job is to just pester, in a good way, anybody that\u2019s not getting
        their job done. If we have a deadline for the money coming in and somebody
        didn\u2019t get it in then the bulldog calls the host of that person, that
        guest, and tells them, \u201cYou need to call so and so and tell them that
        they didn\u2019t get their money in.\u201d That\u2019s a good job, I mean,
        that really helps. We have somebody who just deals with the poster. That person
        also deals with the press releases, but it doesn\u2019t have to be them, they
        just happen to want to do both jobs. My job is to deal with public radio and
        any of those kinds of things that come up.\nAW: Any of the media?\nRB: Mm-hmm,
        and then I make suggestions on other media things that I think we should do,
        to the marketing committee, and then they decide if they want to present it
        to the group. If we need to we\u2019ll have a meeting online. There are two
        people who send out the notice letter to all the participants on what the
        deadlines are. They write that letter and introduction that tells all the
        guests, This date you\u2019re supposed to have your slides in, your images
        and This date, half of the money deposited by November 1st because that\u2019s
        what we use to buy the advertising\u2014the first wave of it.\nTM: Like a
        down payment? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n30\nRB:
        Yeah.\nAW: So the guests, they\u2019re selected individually by each artist
        and then guests will send in money to be part of [the Tour], as each of you
        are.\nRB: We all pay equally.\nAW: Oh you do, so both you and guests.\nRB:
        Mm-hmm. Everybody\u2019s location has different costs: some people rent tents,
        some people don\u2019t, some have port-a-toilets and some don\u2019t, some
        have food that they charge the guests a part of and other people don\u2019t
        charge. I bought two golf carts; people helped me pay for those. I hire two
        traffic ladies\u2014my neighbor over here she hires somebody and they run
        the traffic and tell people where to park all weekend.\nAW: Where do they
        park?\nRB: We drive all our cars to the front, all of the potters\u2019 cars,
        right up where you turn in the driveway, in that field. It gets mowed.\nAW:
        And for visitors?\nRB: They park alongside the road and then we have golf
        carts that will give them rides if they want or they can walk.\nAW: How does
        that work if each person has different costs at their studio?\nRB: The guests
        at that studio pay those costs separate from the group. That\u2019s up to
        the host to decide how they distribute those costs: some people do it based
        on percentage of sales, some people do it equally, some people\u2014the host
        doesn\u2019t pay anything and the guests divide those costs up. Everybody
        has a different way of doing it.\n02:15:22\nAW: How do you do it?\nRB: We
        divide it equally. I\u2019ve never asked the guests to help me pay for the
        food. That was always our expense, although this year we\u2019re changing
        to\u2014we\u2019re going to have three food trucks here so instead of us producing\u2014we
        couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\nAW: What did you used to do?\nRB: Right here
        on this table, we would expand it and we fed everybody. Try to feed four thousand
        people and it\u2019s--\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n31\nAW:
        What would you make? How would you go about doing it?\nRB: We\u2019d make
        salads, spreads, dips, spreads, chips, salsas. It varied every year.\nAW:
        And the visitors could come just in here and just have a snack?\nRB: Yeah,
        and use the bathrooms.\nAW: That\u2019s amazing to open up your house to all
        these people.\nRB: Yeah, but it\u2019s nice.\nAW: You were explaining how
        it works here at your studio: you split things up, you were talking about
        the food and everyone coming through\u2014did you always offer food? When
        did you start doing that?\nRB: Always. Right from day one. In the beginning
        it was the fact that there were no restaurants here and we knew people were
        coming up from the Twin Cities and we didn\u2019t have anything to recommend
        them. We like to cook so we started to making the food. Then it became a really
        big deal and we really started experimenting with the food. The last three
        years it\u2019s almost impossible for us to keep up, so we decided to cut
        it and go to food trucks.\nAW: What are the food trucks you\u2019re expecting
        this year?\nRB: We\u2019re going to have a BBQ [truck] from Cambridge, an
        Asian food truck from Rush City, and a portable wood fire pizza oven. We\u2019re
        going to have cookies and brownies and coffee and tea and I\u2019ll have beer.
        We go through a lot of beer.\nAW: I can imagine. Do you make your own beer?\nRB:
        No, but I have friends that do. Friday night we have a party. Other things
        we do on the Tour is on Thursday night we have a catered dinner at Connee
        Mayeron\u2019s house that\u2019s an Indian restaurant over in St. Croix Falls,
        brings us fabulous food. Everybody\u2014the potters and their spouses and
        whoever they brought for helpers\u2014they would come to that dinner and it\u2019s
        just kind of a big social. On Friday night we have a party here: people bring
        musical instruments and we sit around the fire and break out a bunch of different
        kind of food than we would have had during the day, and people bring their
        hooch and we have a lot of wine.\nAW: Has that been an important part of your
        approach to this [tour]\u2014having food and wine?\nRB: My approach, but not
        everybody\u2019s. In fact, I think a lot of people don\u2019t like the idea
        that there\u2019s alcohol and food and stuff, but they\u2019ve kind of warmed
        up to it. It\u2019s our personality, you know, my wife and I both. We like
        nice groups of people and hanging out around food. And get as much of it locally
        as you can\u2014local cheese, local bread, local whatever. We buy a lot of
        stuff from our food co-op in Cambridge. We try to have all the beer be local
        craft beers if we can. If someone puts in a request for something that\u2019s
        a little harder to call local, I\u2019ll do that to, but still A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n32\nit has to be handmade.
        I try to make the whole weekend a celebration of handmade\u2014the food, cheese,
        breads, just everything, get it as close to not factory as possible.\n02:20:10\nAW:
        Do people from around the area who make breads, make cheese\u2014do you invite
        them to have their stuff here too?\nRB: No, this will be new this year with
        food for sale. We\u2019ve never allowed anything to be for sale other than
        the pots. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have some discussions about it
        because I told everybody last year that I was doing this\u2014having food
        trucks\u2014and actually a couple of other ones are having food trucks. We\u2019ll
        see how\u2014I think there\u2019s going to be some push and pull of, What
        does this mean for the Tour? We\u2019ve never done it before, so there will
        be some conversation about how do we handle it. Hopefully, everybody has a
        good experience and nobody sees it as a kind of competition, or a negative.
        We\u2019re a really interesting group: we come at pots and money and sales
        and all those things\u2014we have much different philosophies about it. We
        get along about it; we\u2019ve been able to solve all our differences: some
        people don\u2019t like taking credit cards, and other people do. We don\u2019t
        enforce that on anybody. Here we have a central checkout that all the guests\u2019
        work is sold through one place. Other places, each potter is selling their
        own work. It\u2019s a different approach. I don\u2019t want people to have
        to get their wallet out more than once. That\u2019s why we do it that way.
        You run the risk of making mistakes but we have a pretty good system, and
        then we have back-ups to back-ups so nobody gets hooked. I\u2019m responsible
        if it\u2019s negative.\nAW: Have you kept this system the same way or did
        you change things over time?\nRB: That\u2019s always been that way. As soon
        as I started having guests we\u2019ve had a central cashier. Other people\u2014some
        have come to it, and some haven\u2019t. It works. I just think it\u2019s remarkable
        that seven really distinctive personalities we get along, we put it on, and
        we don\u2019t have to work very hard at it.\nAW: Yeah, one big planning meeting
        each year, that\u2019s amazing.\nRB: --Yeah, somebody interviewed me for the
        radio once and they said, \u201cReally? You only have one meeting?\u201d And
        I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d And they said, \u201cYou can get it all done?\u201d
        And I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d And they just wouldn\u2019t let it go, and they
        said, \u201cWell, why do you just have one meeting?\u201d And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s
        all we need.\u201d And they said, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d And I said,
        \u201cWell, maybe\u201d\u2014and I was just being facetious\u2014\u201cMaybe,
        if you have too many meetings you find out that you don\u2019t like each other.
        Maybe, if you have one meeting you don\u2019t build up any animosities, and
        we don\u2019t have them.\u201d They thought that was a good answer.\nAW: That
        is interesting though, why do you think the group has worked so well and that
        this tour has continued?\nRB: It was really debatable if it was going to survive
        till the fifth year. By the fifth year it was clearly working. Whatever we
        were doing was beneficial and that was about that time we started A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n33\nhaving guests. We
        never asked the guest to provide a mailing list. It was just the mailing lists
        of the seven of us that we were really dependent on. We didn\u2019t do much
        advertising. We tried the newspaper but that seemed like a waste of money.
        Later, about five years ago, we started advertising on public radio which
        was fabulous. I think one of the other\u2014not that it\u2019s a secret\u2014but
        one of the fundamentals of this group is that they were willing to put up
        a significant amount of money. We weren\u2019t talking about fifty dollars
        a person; we were talking about 500 dollars a person. When you have fifty
        people you suddenly have a lot of money, so you can start having conversations
        about sponsoring public radio. The other thing that we do in our fee, we require
        that we have a 6,000 dollar pool that we all pay into equally that we give
        to a charity of some sort. So that\u2019s $6,000 and it goes to something
        in ceramics: either an exhibition, or we\u2019ve bought potters wheels for
        the local high school, we bought a pugmill for one of the schools, we\u2019ve
        bought a kiln for a school, we\u2019ve given money to Potters for Peace and
        to the Craft Emergency Relief Fund. Sometimes we\u2019ll meet in September\u2014so
        I lied about the one meeting\u2014if in our one meeting, we haven\u2019t been
        able to decide who we\u2019re going to give that money to then we\u2019ll
        maybe have another one in September to come up with the charity we want to
        give it to.\n02:26:32\nAW: Is that a common feature of other art fairs, or
        is this another thing that makes the Tour distinct?\nRB: Early on we had this
        conversation and the group, we said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a philanthropic
        shade to this? Why don\u2019t we give back to the community?\u201d Because
        we\u2019re all sort of either right at sixty or past sixty, so, you know,
        it\u2019s time; you don\u2019t just be on the receiving end. Everybody thought
        that was a good idea. For four years, back then, we were doing five percent
        of the total sale, and we were giving that to the Weisman Art Museum for a
        ceramic purchase fund. We didn\u2019t have any restrictions on it, it just
        had to be ceramic; we didn\u2019t say it had to be pottery or whatever. So
        they put a lot of work in their ceramics because of that fund. After that
        fourth year then we moved it to somewhere else.\nAW: In those first four years
        what was five percent of the overall sales?\nRB: Over those four years we
        gave them $18,000 dollars.\nAW: Wow, that\u2019s a substantial amount.\nRB:
        I think this year we\u2019ll exceed half a million dollars in sales. We don\u2019t
        talk to each other about how the sale went at each place. We do talk about
        it but we don\u2019t have any accurate numbers, you know, people just, \u201cOh,
        our place did about this much.\u201d It was over $450,000 last year.\nAW:
        From seven studios, seven individuals, plus all the guests. How many total
        is that?\nRB: Forty- nine total. So, it was like $9,000, average. And in a
        potter\u2019s world, that\u2019s a lot. Most people don\u2019t have an event
        in a year that even comes close. It isn\u2019t life-changing money but what
        this event does\u2014for all of us\u2014is it gives you this leveling so if
        you do art fairs or galleries or A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n34\nexhibitions or studio sales at your own studio, what
        this does is it\u2019s a big enough amount of money that it kind of levels
        out their stress. I don\u2019t know if other people in the group will talk
        about numbers. They might ask you not to mention that number. For some people
        it is a significant amount of money for their lives. I think what it does
        is it gives confidence, especially to the new younger potters. If they can
        count on this, it kind of gives them a base that they can build from. And
        they\u2019re getting 4,000 or 5,000 people coming to see their work which,
        if they\u2019re keeping track of people\u2019s addresses and stuff, then they\u2019re
        building an audience of their own through this event. One thing, Guillermo
        Cuellar did a survey three years ago and it was the first year\u2014maybe
        it was four years ago, I think it was the first year we started public radio
        sponsors\u2014and he surveyed 261 people and thirty-nine percent said it was
        their first time here. The only thing we did different was we sponsored spots
        on public radio. Another shocking number that like thirty-one percent were
        under thirty-five years old. I attribute that to The Current, to putting spots
        on The Current. It\u2019s been really fascinating to watch it evolve. Like
        I said earlier, when we went to the color photography poster, it doubled that
        year. On the twenty-first year, I think it went up seven percent, something
        like that. It\u2019s just crazy that we\u2019re still growing. We\u2019re
        actually having parking problems.\n02:31:54\nAW: I was just thinking, as you
        were talking about the 4,000-5,000 people that sounds like a lot of cars,
        a lot of people, and the coordinating of that, how does that work?\nRB: I
        hire my neighbor to help park people, so they did it efficiently; it wasn\u2019t
        just helter skelter. She gets another person\u2014and I give them walk talkies\u2014she
        greets them as they come in and the other one walks up and down the road and
        finds empty spots and tells her, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s one on the top of
        the hill.\u201d We also have the golf carts that run up and down so people
        don\u2019t have to carry their bags to far. Still, at 9:30 on Friday morning,
        it\u2019s full. I\u2019ve talked to the local church over here and the pastor,
        they\u2019ve got a big parking lot. We\u2019re working up a potential valet
        parking thing over at the church or at least delivery, people park over there
        and we drive up and have a van and bring them over; it\u2019s the overflow.\nAW:
        How do you keep track of how many people come through? You said someone greets
        them, does she have a--?\nRB: She has a clicker.\nAW: So you have a pretty
        exact number?\nRB: Yeah, except there were ten hours that the show was open
        that she wasn\u2019t at the show. She counted just over 4,000 last year with
        ten hours that--\nAW: --were missing, so even more probably. Wow.\nRB: And
        there are people that don\u2019t come here, who go to other places, so I know
        the number is closer to 5,000 or more. It\u2019s all pretty amazing. I think
        we did a bunch of things right: we made it all ceramic, which\u2014other tours
        are successful without doing that\u2014but I think this one, that\u2019s a
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n35\nbig part
        of it. The other thing is that the artist has to be here so there\u2019s that
        communication going on. I make my guests bring a helper because I want them
        not to be wrapping and packing, I want them to talk about their work, so it\u2019s
        education. And then, we started having guests. I think it broadened the whole
        appeal of it because it started becoming a ceramic survey\u2014we weren\u2019t
        just all inviting people who look like us, we were inviting people remarkably
        different from us. My eight guests, I think there\u2019s only two that you
        could say they even fit in the same strain. With our guests, we weren\u2019t
        even asking them to participate with mailings and stuff, that only happened
        about five years ago where we started asking people to give us their lists
        because we had woken up to the fact that it had become a national event so
        these guests were coming from all over the country and they had audience members
        in their parts of the country so we asked them\u2014our mailing costs went
        way up but, you know, we sent out 33,000 posters last year. We still send
        a physical mailing. Once you realize it\u2019s a national event then you have
        to send the announcement by January 1st, because people need to make their
        vacation plans. We used to send them out in April but now we send them out
        in January so that people can get organized, you know, make flights and hotels,
        and vacation, because they work.\n02:36:13\nAW: And it\u2019s always been
        Mother\u2019s Day weekend?\nRB: We\u2019ve changed it twice and it didn\u2019t
        work right, so we moved it back to Mother\u2019s Day. Both times, we moved
        it off and we\u2019ve moved it back and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t care which
        weekend we do it, let\u2019s do it consistently from now on.\u201d So we did
        and I think Mother\u2019s Day has been great. Although, there are a lot of
        tours which have started up and they\u2019re on Mother\u2019s Day too. What
        I was hoping was that we would invite each other to all these different places
        around the country to these tours but if they\u2019re all on the same weekend,
        you can\u2019t do that. (Laughs). They\u2019re not all on that weekend but,
        there\u2019s one going on this weekend in Massachusetts and\u2014A lot of
        these are directly a result of this one. I think that was one of the big strengths
        of this event is that we showed the possibility of a group getting together
        and self-promoting and that it\u2019s effective. I don\u2019t think we had
        been through the idea of a studio tour but I think focusing it on one craft
        medium and then also, once you have the establishment, see if you can expand
        it regionally and then expand it nationally and it\u2019s been really effective.\nAW:
        When you guys were first starting, do you think it was individual artists,
        like name and recognition of their work, that brought people in initially
        and then a sense of this regional thing?\nRB: That\u2019s always been a debate.
        When I first invited Mary Barringer, nobody here really knew who Mary was,
        I mean, there may have been a few people. She established an audience right
        away because of the quality of her work, people fell in love with it. The
        next year they came here specifically to find Mary. I think we just have that
        strong of an audience in Minnesota that when artists come from other parts
        of the country, or even other parts of the region or state, they\u2019re exposed
        to this really well educated audience for ceramics. Now, because of the momentum
        that it has, now we\u2019re getting people coming in from out of state who
        are collectors and pot lovers and so they\u2019re coming, I think, because
        of the quantity of artists in one place and the quantity of pots in one place
        but more importantly the quality. I think we do a good job of treating people
        well when they get here. It\u2019s the friendly hospitality has been a big
        part of our philosophy. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n36\nAW:
        Something that strikes me is that you\u2019re inviting people onto your property,
        into your homes, and that\u2019s one thing that makes it special, maybe from
        other art fairs which are usually in a public space, not necessarily in people\u2019s
        home where they make the work. Has that made this tour unique that they get
        to see what you\u2019re surrounded by, you know, your environment?\nRB: Absolutely.
        I talked a couple of young potters in Pittsburgh into starting a tour in Pittsburgh.
        There are a number of them in Minneapolis and stuff, you know. This guy called
        me up and said, \u201cWe did it. We had it.\u201d And I said, \u201cHow did
        it go?\u201d And he goes, \u201cIt was overwhelming. Now we have the problem
        of\u2014now all the people that wouldn\u2019t join us on this first year\u2014now
        all want to be a part of it. How do you deal with that?\u201d And I said,
        \u201cPick the best. I don\u2019t mean to be arrogant about it but, you know,
        it\u2019s your event, make it the best you can, it doesn\u2019t have to be
        egalitarian.\u201d In fact, that\u2019s what ruins a lot of them is that people
        can\u2019t say no. What we decided\u2014I think that was the other thing that
        was really important\u2014was let\u2019s keep it small and intimate and not
        make people work too hard to get around the thing. Then, if it\u2019s successful,
        we can expand it internally. So you still have just seven stops, but now we
        have fifty-one potters. I just was reading Asparagus Valley Pottery Tour in
        Massachusetts is this weekend. Mary Barringer is on that tour and a couple
        of other potters that I know. They asked us about it, how to do it, and they
        have nine stops and twenty-two potters. They didn\u2019t have guests four
        years ago. This is their tenth anniversary. So they went six years without
        have any guests. There\u2019s kind of built-in myth--because selling artwork
        is difficult, and you get the idea that you\u2019re going to bring other people
        in to compete with you for what\u2019s perceived as a given pie\u2014and our
        philosophy has always been that if we make the pie bigger, the results will
        be bigger. It\u2019s not like you bring in more potters and then the pie gets
        sliced up finer and finer, that\u2019s just not true. I think that\u2019s
        baloney. One of the really great things that happened to us was when 2008,
        when the economy collapsed, when 2009 rolled around you could kind of see\u2014I
        read the economic pages, I mean, I get The Economist, I read all that stuff.
        It\u2019s boring for most people but I have that degree, so I still find it
        fascinating. You could see the winds were changing, you know, it was devastating
        but it was getting a little better, you know, there were some warm winds starting
        to blow. I was getting a lot of calls from guests that were saying, \u201cWhat
        do you think?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the best one ever.\u201d
        And they were like, \u201cNo way.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, if you don\u2019t
        bring all the pots you can bring, you\u2019re crazy, because it\u2019s going
        to be the best one ever.\u201d And they said, \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d
        And I go, \u201cBecause it\u2019s more important now. People are hurt, but
        it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d They all did, they all brought plenty of
        work, and we had the best one ever. I think MPR did a survey that year of
        all the arts organizations around, and they called me up and they said, \u201cWell,
        you guys have this event, how is the economy affecting you?\u201d I said,
        \u201cWe added fourteen percent more artists and we had record sales.\u201d
        I think the Guthrie and all these people cutting programs and slashing the
        budgets, I think it was an absolute huge mistake. I think they went exactly
        the wrong direction. I think maybe if they would have said to staff, \u201cWell,
        maybe we\u2019re going to cut your hours a little bit but everyone\u2019s
        going to stay employed. And you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re
        going to do more concerts, we\u2019re going to do more performances, and we\u2019re
        going to do more free ones, because what we\u2019re going to do is to build
        our audience for ten years from now and we\u2019re going to use this downtime
        to talk to people about how important art is in their lives. Instead, they
        all kind of hid their head in the sand and said, \u201cThis is a terrible
        time and we\u2019ve got to cut this play and that play and this performance.\u201d
        I just think that was stupid, horribly stupid. A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n37\n02:45:45\nAW: And so even in 2010 and
        2011, as people were still recovering, it has continued to grow?\nRB: It\u2019s
        grown every year. I think in the whole history of the thing it\u2019s only
        gone backwards one year and that was because two people didn\u2019t have as
        many guests. They went from five to none. So, we went from maybe twenty-five
        guests to nineteen guests. There were fewer pots. It hasn\u2019t been on a
        curve like that [makes steep upward gesture with hand] but it\u2019s gone
        up two, three, four, ten percent every year. It\u2019s just silly.\nAW: That
        is amazing. On the topic of guests, when did you start inviting guests?\nRB:
        I think on the fifth year.\nAW: So that was--?\nRB: Nineteen ninety-seven,
        maybe.\nAW: And what was the criteria for inviting guests?\nRB: Your friends,
        people you respected.\nAW: How did you pick your first guests?\nRB: I picked
        John Turula because he\u2019s a great ceramics sculptor and he\u2019s a friend
        of long [standing]. He didn\u2019t think he would, he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s
        a pottery show. What would I bring\u201d He makes these wonderful whimsical
        sculptures and tile and clay. He sold a couple, but the week afterwards he
        got a $20,000 commission from somebody who came to this event. He was probably
        a fish out of water, sort of, but he had great results from it. Then I invited
        Mary Barringer who is an old friend who I met in Washington D.C. at a ceramics
        event there, we just go along really good. She\u2019s a tremendous ceramics
        artist. Her partner, or girlfriend, is just one of the best people on the
        planet so if I can invite Mary then I can get her partner to come. Then I
        was like, Why one? Why not two or three?\nAW: The first year was one?\nRB:
        One, but some people had more, I just had one. But the next year I had two.\nAW:
        John and Mary?\nRB: No, John, he never came back.\nAW: How do you spell his
        last name?\nRB: T-u-r-u-l-a, Turula. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n38\nAW: So the second year was two different guests and
        the third year--?\nRB: And then the third year I had a third. Then, the question
        within my own guests was\u2014because I wanted to have a fourth\u2014well,
        there was an argument about, \u201cWill the dynamics between having four people
        here or having five people here might get significantly strange?\u201d I thought
        about that so I didn\u2019t add a person. Then the next year I thought, That
        was crazy. My gut feeling is the more the merrier. I didn\u2019t want to blow
        it up until I was sure that it was good for everybody. So now I have eight
        guests and the group has decided that\u2019s the ceiling, which I would argue
        that I\u2019d like to have one more. Then I could have a rotational pool,
        so I can have people be in for three years and out a year and in for three
        and out a year and then I can have a pool of twelve to fifteen people. That
        would be interesting. But they\u2019re my friends so I invite the same ones
        every year.\n02:49:56\nAW: So everyone comes back?\nRB: That want to. I\u2019ve
        had three people not come back, for whatever reason. One I didn\u2019t invite.
        And two\u2014one of them, her husband died the next spring, so she couldn\u2019t
        come; and I had a woman here from Scotland, Hannah McAndrew, and she had gotten
        a grant from the Scottish government to do this and she didn\u2019t think
        she could get it this year, so she didn\u2019t come back. Which was too bad
        because she did really well and it was really nice to see her work which was
        an old English slipware, kind of in a traditional vein but not too traditional,
        beautiful work and just a lovely person. I would like her to come back. I
        think it takes awhile to build an audience, even though we have this special
        audience, I think people need a second and a third and a fourth year to establish
        the depth of an audience, and that\u2019s why I just want people to keep coming.\nAW:
        What was it like to have an international artist be part of the Tour?\nRB:
        She was just a potter with an accent. And, she didn\u2019t like biscuits and
        gravy (laughs). We went out for breakfast one morning and she was like, \u201cNo
        way would I eat that. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re eating it.\u201d I
        ordered it because I thought she should try a colloquial, you know, United
        States thing that you probably don\u2019t see anywhere else, but she didn\u2019t
        want that.\nAW: When guests come they have to pay their own way to get out
        here?\nRB: Yep, they have to. All their expenses, including the helper I require
        them to bring, is at their expense. They can hire somebody locally, which
        some of them do, or they bring somebody with them.\nAW: And are any of them
        from the local area or are they from other places?\nRB: Jason Trebs is from
        St. Paul, Jo Severson is from Clearwater, Minnesota. Matt Metz used to live
        in Houston, Minnesota but now he lives in New York State, and he\u2019s been
        coming since he lived here. Where else? I think the rest of them are from
        out of state. Craig Edwards is going to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR.
        Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n39\nbe here this year, first time; he\u2019s from New
        London. I have somebody from Massachusetts; a couple from North Carolina;
        Matt Metz from New York state; and everybody else is local.\nAW: Where do
        they stay? Do they stay here?\nRB: No they don\u2019t. We used to house everybody
        and we were having thirty-five people for breakfast. We have six queen size
        beds up there--\nAW: In the bunkhouse?\nRB: --and a couch, and then we have
        one, two, three extra beds besides our own. We had nine beds of people plus
        the couch and this couch if it was available. Some people were camping. It
        was getting to be too much pressure on my wife so now I make all the income-earning
        people get a hotel or stay with friends, but any of the helpers can stay here
        for free. So the ones that aren\u2019t making any money, they get free room
        and board.\nAW: Oh, that\u2019s nice. That\u2019s really generous.\nRB: Well,
        it\u2019s not\u2014I mean, it\u2019s just what you should do. So, we\u2019ll
        have food going all day for all the helpers. Back in this back bedroom we\u2019ll
        have a break room back there so people can go back there and have enchiladas\u2014I
        think I\u2019ll make enchiladas, and some posole, and some leek potato soups,
        and then we\u2019ll probably have bread and cheese and meat, chips and salsa.
        My wife will probably make vegetarian chili; she\u2019s vegetarian. Saturday
        night, there\u2019s a guy from Chicago, he comes up and he\u2019s here all
        weekend. He\u2019s this incredible cook\u2014he\u2019s from Bangladesh\u2014and
        he\u2019ll put on a Bangladeshi dinner Saturday night here for everybody.
        He just completely destroys the kitchen; it\u2019s great. (Laughs)\n02:55:28\nAW:
        He cooks for everybody who is here?\nRB: Everybody, yeah.\nAW: When did he
        start coming up here? How did you get to know him?\nRB: I didn\u2019t remember
        this but he and I had a show together in Chicago at Will Street Gallery. We
        talked but I didn\u2019t remember him. He called up Monday and said, \u201cHi,
        this is Kareem. I want to know if you could use some help in the kitchen for
        your pottery tour.\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d He came and brought a friend\u2014Ernie,
        just buddies\u2014and the two of them just cooked up a storm and helped the
        kitchen crew make all this food. He\u2019s been coming ever since. Now, another
        friend of his, John Roquette, from Mississippi, comes up every year and helps;
        just an incredible human being.\nAW: Does sound like a great opportunity to
        meet people, artists, people who love pottery, and just people you\u2019ve
        connected with; the friendships that have developed and bring people here.
        That\u2019s amazing. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n40\nRB:
        Yeah, and my hockey playing friend, Carol, she and her partner\u2014I never
        know how women who are married, how they refer to their spouse or partner,
        I asked them that\u2014Carol, who was an apprentice of mine, probably thirty
        years ago in Minneapolis at that studio\u2014and we\u2019ve been friends ever
        since. She\u2018s quit being a potter\u2014she never really got into that\u2014she
        became a master electrician and now she\u2019s selling real estate. She and
        her partner, Erika, they come out and run the sales tent. We have right people
        in there packing and wrapping. That changes everyday. Northern Clay Center
        has an option for their employees\u2014they can either work at Northern Clay
        on Friday or they can come out here, or one of the stops, and volunteer. So,
        that\u2019s how we get all these people to help.\nAW: That\u2019s a big thing\u2014dozens
        and dozens of people who are helping the event happen and all the visitors
        who come through. That\u2019s a lot of people who come through here in one
        weekend.\nRB: Yeah, and it just seems to work, and it doesn\u2019t seem like
        we\u2019re managing anything. It just seems like it happens. I know that my
        wife has managed a lot of the kitchen and carol and Erica manage the sales
        tent, and I mostly drink beer (Laughs).\nAW: (Laughs) Well, you\u2019re managing
        the production of pottery. Seems like people volunteer to help and when here,
        everyone goes into their role and you don\u2019t have to have a lot of oversight
        on individuals and what they\u2019re doing?\nRB: No, there are decisions made
        all the time. If something screws up, if a credit card machine breaks, you
        have to figure out how to compensate for that. Or, if the phone line doesn\u2019t
        work anymore\u2026\nAW: I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably gotten late.
        We have just some last reflection questions. I\u2019ll start with this one:
        what are your fondest memories of the Tour?\nRB: Yeah, we were talking about
        that today. One of the things is the year the economy collapsed, and it just
        proved to be stronger than that; that was really pleasant. When people come
        from out of state who you met in other places, it\u2019s jaw-dropping. It\u2019s
        like, Wow, this is wonderful that you came. There\u2019s just so many things:
        looking out and seeing seven or eight tents out in the yard; or students coming
        up from Nebraska\u2014they can\u2019t afford a hotel\u2014they come up in
        a group, and they camp out in the back yard and ramble in here and take showers.
        It\u2019s great.\n03:00:40\nAW: I think it\u2019s interesting from how you
        described when you first got into pottery, you didn\u2019t really have a community
        like this around to support you along the way. Is that important to you now
        to provide that support and encouragement for young artists?\nRB: Yeah, I\u2019m
        not real fond of being the center of anything; I like to be part of other
        things. I don\u2019t like to be considered \u201cthe guy,\u201d but I do think
        that having this as a tool to show younger people that it\u2019s actually
        possible to make a living [with ceramics]\u2014I think that\u2019s really
        huge. I think it has. It makes it more plausible, comparing it to when a lot
        of us started, the idea of A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n41\ninventing
        something from nothing. Now, I think it\u2019s cool that you don\u2019t have
        to invent it from nothing. You just have to use your wits and your own hard
        work, and it\u2019s possible. Your choices aren\u2019t either to be a teacher
        or waiter potter, or lawyer potter\u2014if you want to, you can actually choose
        to be a potter. I think this shows that.\nThere\u2019s one little story\u2014I
        was doing an art fair in Des Moines and there was a young woman who came in
        and said, \u201cI want to start a tour like yours.\u201d She said, \u201c
        Do you have time to interview you?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d We sat
        down behind my booth and we talked for two hours. I told her, \u201cHere\u2019s
        what you should do, here\u2019s what you shouldn\u2019t do. Whatever you do,
        don\u2019t do this. Whatever you do, do this. Don\u2019t take any public money.
        Keep it small. Keep it intimate. Invite the best people.\u201d They are thirty-five
        miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, and it\u2019s called the North Omaha Pottery
        Trail. She started this thing, and I would get her brochure every year in
        the mail, announcing it. No guests, but it was only five or six studios. The
        graphics were, you know, not really cool; it wasn\u2019t that interesting.
        The fifth year, I have it, I got this really nice thing, this really beautifully
        put together graphic piece. I called her up and said, \u201cThis is really
        excellent.\u201d I just said it over her answering machine. \u201cIt really
        feels like you\u2019ve turned a corner.\u201d She called me back and we talked
        for a while. She said, \u201cYeah, this year we had eight hundred people,\u201d
        come to their tour, which is thirty-five miles north of Omaha. Last year,
        they had eight hundred people both Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\nAW: --they
        doubled.\nRB: Yeah, and now it\u2019s become this regional thing for them.
        People come down. Now they\u2019re inviting guests. It\u2019s starting to
        rock and roll. It\u2019s fun to see it. There\u2019s tours over in Wisconsin\u2014there
        must be five or six of them that have fashioned from this one. There\u2019s
        one in Massachusetts. There\u2019s one in Syracuse, New York, that started
        because of this one. One in Tampa, Florida. There\u2019s a really good one
        that\u2019s starting up in Austin, Texas called the Art of the Pot and they\u2019re
        just having really good success. It\u2019s fun to see it. I\u2019m not seeing
        that we did everything for all these things, but I think we showed people
        that it\u2019s possible to do something pretty big and have it have an impact.
        I have this perverse hope that ten years from now that there will actually
        be a million people in the United States that have fallen in love with pottery
        and that no matter where you are in the country, if you really want to do
        it, you can do it.\n03:05:57\nAW: What are your hopes for the Tour in the
        future?\nRB: I think now I just want it to maintain itself and, at the same
        time, I want to pass it on to another generation\u2014which we\u2019re doing
        here, Mary and I. We\u2019re selling the place to a young potter so they\u2019ll
        be able to carry it on. I think other people will figure out how they can
        pass their thing on. Have the legacy of this thing be that it didn\u2019t
        just go for twenty-five or thirty years, that it\u2019s sixty years that another
        generation will run it, and they\u2019ll do just as well with it. And, change
        it however they need to make it relevant to their generation, their audience,
        their desires. I think that\u2019s very possible.\nAW: What makes it possible?
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nR. Briscoe\n04\/26\/14\n42\nRB: Minnesota,

        is a project assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed, Linda, and
        why don\u2019t we get started? First if you could tell us when and where were
        you born?\nLC: Well, I just found my baby book, that\u2019s really funny.
        I was born in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, in 1952. That\u2019s not the town where
        I lived but it was the town that had a hospital.\nAW: What was the town where
        you lived?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n2\nLC:
        It was a little town called Barron, Wisconsin, which is kind of a good name
        although it\u2019s spelled B-a-r-r-o-n. It was just a little agricultural
        lumber town with two railroads, which was interesting\u2014two railroads that
        intersected. I ended up playing a lot at the railroad tracks. I really liked
        the railroad. We had a river and a creek and I grew up on a little creek.
        Through the woods was a creamery, so I spent a lot of time there at the creamery.
        (Laughs)\nAW: Working or helping out?\nLC: Oh, just observing and playing.
        I spent a lot of time with the butter makers. I really liked that idea\u2014as
        a child I liked the idea of industry and making something. There was a big
        room where they had a couple of big butter churns and I really liked the whole
        process of making butter and the butter makers\u2014they were very interesting
        to me because they were so observant and they could hear the butter and they
        could tell what was going on just by listening. They were so observant. The
        whole idea of making something that\u2019s beautiful, delicious, becomes part
        of you, actually, becomes part of your body. I actually thought about that
        as a kid. It just was really impressive to me. It was aesthetic; it was pleasing
        in everyway. It had everything. (Laughs)\nAW: Did you ever get a chance to
        churn butter yourself?\nLC: Oh, yeah I think I did. As you do as a kid, we
        could go to the creamery and get cream. My mom would send us to the creamery
        with a jar and fifty cents and bring cream home and shake it. But the scale
        was not the same, it was different. I didn\u2019t want to become a butter
        maker or anything like that, but it impressed me that it was a career and
        it was public service; it kind of had everything. It was hard work, actually.
        There were two women that sat in a room packaging butter and that was fascinating
        too. They just sat and gossiped. I would just sit and listen to them and watch
        them. Their job didn\u2019t seem as interesting to me, but that was their
        job was to put the butter in a\u2014actually there was a little machine that
        had wax paper and squirted out the butter and folded it into this beautiful
        little rectangle. These women would pick it up and put it in a box and they
        would just sit and gossip about everyone in the town. That was really fascinating
        to me as well, just their occupation\u2014it wasn\u2019t as aesthetically
        pleasing but they just sat and gossiped and that was fascinating to me from
        a\u2014I don\u2019t know what kind of viewpoint, maybe as a sociologist or
        something? It was just fascinating listening to these women over many years.
        All they did was gossip and work with their hands\u2014they were really factory
        workers. They just did repetitive work but they gossiped. It was fascinating
        and it sustained them. It could never sustain me, but it sustained their life.
        It was fascinating to me. I couldn\u2019t wait to leave the little town (laughs),
        but it was really fascinating to have this sort of industry just through the
        woods from my house.\n00:05:20\nThere were a couple of other people I spent
        time with. The milk can haulers\u2014they could lift up two milk cans full
        of milk at the one time, one with each hand. I don\u2019t know what a milk
        can weighs now but they were super strong. They were like brutes in a way
        but they were very interesting to me, their job. They would pull up to a little
        door and knock the lid off with a metal rod and then\u2014well, the can would
        go through a door, inside they would knock the lid off and dump it. As kids
        we would ride on the milk can covers down a little conveyor belt. That was
        like our playground; that was super fun. You\u2019d get kind of a ring on
        your butt from the milk can lids. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n3\nWe\u2019d come home filthy because they burned
        coal at the creamery. Everything was coated with this coal dust, and my mother,
        I know, would always be angry\u2014I\u2019d come home just filthy.\nThe other
        place I would go would be down to the boiler where the guy\u2014I thought
        it was the greatest job in the world\u2014he would sit in a chair outside,
        leaning against a wall, there would be a little creek there. He could hear
        when the boiler needed coal, and he\u2019d go inside and shovel coal into
        the boiler. He\u2019d open the door\u2014it\u2019s sort of like a kiln, really\u2014it
        was really hot. He\u2019d go in and shovel the coal around and then sit down.
        I thought that was a really great job. I got to shovel some coal. It was great
        as a kid to have this sort of factory. It just had everything you could want
        really, to observe and look at. It was a playground. It was sort of my entertainment.
        There was a lot to explore. I guess I was the kind of kid that liked to figure
        out stuff; what\u2019s going on\u2014kind of like a detective, in a way, you
        know, what\u2019s going on? How does it fit together? What\u2019s the story?
        I think I would have made a good detective probably. (Laughs)\nAW: (Laughs)
        Yeah, certainly if you could connect with those butter ladies and hear what
        they were hearing. You could have made quite a detective in that town.\nLC:
        (Laughs) Yeah, everybody had their own sort of job. There was the train too.
        The train brought the coal and I liked watching the train goods loading and
        unloading and then the coal would come to the creamery and they would dump
        it. That was kind of fascinating too. The whole thing was really an interesting
        process, interesting to have it as a kid; as part of your daily life like,
        if I was bored I would go over there and poke around and watch something being
        made.\nIt\u2019s very unusual to talk about myself\u2014I\u2019ll just put
        that there. Usually my role is to ask you questions, as visitors; I want to
        know about you more than you should want to know about me.\nAW: It is unusual
        for many people to do that, but this is really interesting to hear about your
        early childhood and what attracted you to the creamery like you were saying,
        observing all these people and their jobs and how they did their jobs. What
        creamery was this? Do you remember the name?\nLC: It was called the Barron
        Cooperative Creamery. It was torn down a few years ago. You can still see
        it on Google Earth\u2014most of it; a lot of it is gone.\n00:10:00\nAW: Did
        you have siblings? You said, \u201cWe.\u201d\nLC: Yeah, I have an older brother,
        four years older. He would go over there too but not as much as myself and
        my best friend would go over there a lot. We played there a lot. There was
        a milk can house. That was sort of our main play area, really, where they
        stored the milk cans.\nAW: What was that like?\nLC: It was kind of a big shed.
        It had two sides to it and the height was just right so the milk cans could
        be unloaded into the shed and then they would be stored there when they were
        dry. When A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n4\nthe
        milk truck came, when they would unload, then they would pick up dry milk
        cans from the shed. They were constantly moving them in and out. Gee, that
        was sort of our big playroom, really. We made up all sorts of stories and
        we had characters that\u2014there were two brothers that sort of lived there,
        we think, who we called the Gold Dust Twins. I don\u2019t know if we made
        this up or if they really did live there. That would be something that I should
        really research, these hobo brothers\u2014kind of like gypsies in a way. We
        had a rich imaginary life, I guess, growing up in a little town. There wasn\u2019t
        a whole lot to do\u2014you\u2019d go to the bowling alley or a church function.
        There really wasn\u2019t much to do. I was really busy\u2014the library\u2014but
        the creamery was my main kind of area.\nAW: And who was your best friend?\nLC:
        Her name is Gretchen Smith.\nAW: Have you guys remained in contact?\nLC: Yeah,
        she\u2019s writing a book now about her childhood but she wrote a book about
        her young adult life. She married an older fellow who panned for gold in Alaska,
        so she moved to Alaska and lived that kind of a rural, very primitive rustic
        life for many years. She just wrote a book about it.\nThe other thing about
        the creamery that was unique\u2014our town was very progressive in that the
        creamery had a big steam boiler. Everything ran off steam. They made too much
        steam\u2014whoever engineered the boiler made it too big\u2014so they shipped
        steam through a steam pipe quite a distance. How far? I don\u2019t know, maybe
        half a mile to three-quarters of a mile. They shipped it above ground in an
        insulated pipe and they heated two schools and the library and I believe a
        church. They recycled the steam. It\u2019s very unusual\u2014it\u2019s sort
        of like Iceland or something. It was very neat. We played a lot on this steam
        pipe. It was like an elevated pipe. It seemed really high but it probably
        wasn\u2019t all that high. But it was pretty high where it left the creamery
        and that was the big thrill for all the kids in town was to dare to climb
        the steam pipe\u2014walk on top of it\u2014up to the exit of the creamery.
        They had a water tower too that everybody climbed and painted and that kind
        of thing. I was the kind of kid that would always do something like that on
        a dare, or even on my own, actually, just to do it. It was kind of fun. The
        steam pipe was great. It was on my way to school and Gretchen and I would
        hop on it and run down it until it went underground. It was above ground and
        then it went underground for a while. We would always run on the above-ground
        part. It was fun. It was a great way to grow up.\nAW: You said on your walk
        to school? Tell us about your school. What was that like?\nLC: Well, we\u2019d
        walk through our woods and then down our hill across a little bridge and then
        the steam pipe was through a little creek valley. The first school I went
        to was through the woods. That was a traditional old brick school, which was
        a beautiful school that had beautiful woodwork\u2014you know, the traditional
        brick school that would be two or three stories tall. Always, I think, in
        those schools they had a gym in the middle of the school that always had a
        balcony around the gym, and a stage\u2014just the traditional old beautiful
        classrooms with big windows and beautiful woodwork. The kind of schools they
        tear down. It\u2019s gone now, of course, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n5\nbut it was kind of a small school district. I
        was supposed to go to a country school\u2014a one-room schoolhouse\u2014and
        I was very disappointed. I think I was the first class that didn\u2019t go.
        My brother went to a one-room schoolhouse for a little while. I really looked
        forward to that and didn\u2019t end up doing that. It was a traditional little
        town school. We had a lot of great things about it though. The greatest thing
        was\u2014because we were a small school\u2014all the kids would come together
        at the high school in the gym, and we\u2019d have what was called a lyceum.
        L-y-c-e-u-m. I\u2019ve never really looked up that word\u2014I should because
        I love words\u2014but I think a lyceum must be a place, a gathering where
        you\u2019re shown something that\u2019s remarkable. It could be remarkable
        for many reasons. We had a guy that had throat cancer who came to talk to
        the schools and he smoked through his\u2014he had a tracheotomy\u2014and he\u2019d
        say, \u201cDon\u2019t ever smoke,\u201d and he\u2019d be smoking. He\u2019d
        put his cigarette up to his tracheotomy and say, \u201cDon\u2019t ever smoke
        like me.\u201d He was fantastic, he was terrific. The best one was steel drummers
        from Jamaica. I don\u2019t know if it was Jamaica now that I think about but
        they were really great. They sent shivers up my spine. I\u2019ll never forget
        that. I had never heard of them, never seen them before in my life. They came.
        They were sort of one of the first glimmers of hope that I had of escaping
        the little town. I loved the little town in many ways, but it was so small-minded
        and I was the kind of kid that knew that there must be something different
        out there. The steel drums were the first glimmer of something bigger that
        I ever had. But the lyceum thing: I think it\u2019s probably something that\u2019s
        really worth revitalizing. It makes me think, if I had nothing to do, if I
        didn\u2019t know what to do, I think I would try to get some of this Legacy
        funding and do the lyceum thing in Minnesota with cultural, historical, artistic
        history, I guess, basically. I would take it to schools. I guess you probably
        do this now through film, and all sorts of ways are possible now. But there\u2019s
        nothing like watching someone do something or hear someone in person, I think.
        It\u2019s different than a film. There\u2019s something about this one on
        one or one on a thousand. I think the lyceum model is really an incredible
        model for children. If I had nothing to do with my life I think I would devote
        myself to it.\n00:19:54\nAW: Were there other speakers or groups you remember
        that stood out?\nLC: We had a woman that came and she was really fascinated
        with the First Ladies of the United States. Like the presidents\u2019 wives.
        She sewed the inauguration gown from every first lady\u2014I can\u2019t remember
        how many there were\u2014then she would do a little fashion show and talk
        about the first ladies and what was remarkable about them.\nOh we had the
        guy who does the electric ball, where you put your hand on the ball and your
        hair goes out. We had the Harlem Globetrotters. They were really great. They
        were very cool.\nAW: What school were you in?\nLC: It\u2019s called Barron
        Area Schools.\nAW: How many students?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n6\nLC: In the whole school? I don\u2019t know, maybe
        three hundred or so. Not too many. I just got awarded something from my school.
        I\u2019m kind of mortified. It\u2019s like a Hall of Fame\u2014people who
        are do-gooders who do good and they bring you back as a role model. I\u2019m
        kind of terrified, I don\u2019t know if I have to go and speak or anything.
        It\u2019s really kind of terrifying to me.\nOur town had something else that
        was kind of amazing, and my parents were instrumental in it. My parents were
        college educated and when they would go home to their homes for Christmas
        or Thanksgiving or Easter or something, the foreign students from their college
        didn\u2019t have a place to go. They had a lot of people from interesting
        places like Sudan, Kenya, Japan, China, Taiwan\u2014but the Africans are the
        ones I remember. My parents, after they had been married a while, they started
        to think about that as part of their\u2014I guess you\u2019d call it public
        service\u2014they decided they should do something about it\u2014that those
        students should have a place to go that was with a family that was welcoming.
        It would not only give them a family to bond with and have sort of an extended
        home life, it would give them the opportunity to go somewhere and if they
        enjoyed the people and vice versa they would have a relationship with these
        people for their college life. It might even extend longer and it might lead
        to some kind of international relations. It was really my mother\u2019s idea
        and I think she talked my dad into it. Anyway, they talked some other people
        into it and then all the little churches\u2014not all, but a lot of the churches\u2014in
        our town got together and started this foreign student program. It had a name
        but I don\u2019t remember what it was called. It was just fascinating\u2014you
        could walk down the main street of this little town and you could see these
        beautiful men from Sudan walking down the street with their beautiful white
        native clothing on, this beautiful grey black skin and these beautiful white
        gowns. People would just turn their head, in this little white community and
        these beautiful people from other countries and they had pride in their native
        clothing. It was really something. It was really a wonderful thing to have
        had as part of my childhood, to have had all of these foreign students. That
        again gave me a sense of there\u2019s something bigger, something bigger intellectually
        beyond this little town. I didn\u2019t necessarily have to stay in the little
        town. There was something bigger. I was really grateful for that. As an adult
        now looking back on it, I can see that I was sort of resentful\u2014resent
        is probably a little too strong\u2014but I realize now that I had to share
        my parents with these foreign students. I feel like I didn\u2019t always want
        to share them, my parents. When I look back at holidays, when I look back
        at pictures, there\u2019s all these interesting foreign students and they
        were great\u2014they were part of our family\u2014but they sort of came and
        went. In hindsight now, now that my parents are dead, I miss my parents. I
        miss just us. We always had these extra people. It was really rich, but I
        also feel sort of a sadness, I guess. I wouldn\u2019t call it resentment;
        (sighs) I don\u2019t know what you would call it. Bittersweet, I guess, rich
        and sad. But that was pretty neat, really, as a kid, and as a town, it was
        really a wonderful thing for the town.\n00:26:42\nI recently found out that
        there are a lot of Somalis in this town now. There is a whole culture there,
        there\u2019s an Islamic center, and their soccer team went to state and I
        think it\u2019s mostly Somalis who are on the soccer team. It\u2019s really
        cool. It\u2019s really, really neat. We also had a migrant population who
        came in the summer to pick peas and corn, and that was always interesting,
        too. A lot of people from Mexico and people from southern states would kind
        of come and go during the summer. That was always really interesting. We had
        some native people\u2014there was a reservation to the north\u2014and sometimes
        we would have Native Americans A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n7\nin
        the school. Not too many, but sometimes we would have a few families. We had
        other religious people. We had a few Amish; they didn\u2019t go to our school
        but we had Mennonites. We had quite a few Mennonites in our school up to a
        certain grade. They were always interesting to me because their belief system
        was so different than mine. They were fascinating to me because they had such
        a strong belief. I guess I was always curious about what people thought and
        what they believed and I was able to just\u2014I was sort of like as sociologist
        in a way, I think, as a kid. I was interested in other people\u2019s views
        and beliefs even though I didn\u2019t share it. I was able to be objective,
        I guess; I had an ability to be objective about it just because I was curious.
        That was really interesting to me. They would usually quit school\u2014I can\u2019t
        remember what grade\u2014but there were these twin girls, Shirley and Sharon,
        who went on to nursing school and I admired them so much because they really
        bucked the system. They had a drive to be nurses and they did it against the
        wishes of their community and their family. It was very interesting to me.\nAW:
        What were some of the dynamics between these groups? What were some of your
        observations about that? Were there places where people kept to themselves
        or places or activities where people intersected and merged together? What
        were the dynamics you remember?\nLC: I think it was pretty different than
        small towns today. People really associated with their own religion. There
        were church groups for children. Most people went to a church, they were raised
        in a church, you were expected to go to church and go to the youth groups,
        and really that was your group of friends were from your church. Or Boy Scouts,
        Girl Scouts. Boys had sports so they had that sort of social group. Girls
        had your church group, 4-H\u20144-H was a big deal\u2014that was kind of your
        world. You were expected to stay in that little group, unless you were part
        of a club--4-H, that was the other big group: church, 4-H and boys with sports.\n00:31:32\nAW:
        Were you part of any of those groups?\nLC: I was in 4-H for a little bit.
        The church group? Yeah, I had to go to the church thing, I had to go.\nAW:
        What denomination?\nLC: Methodist. I was lucky because our church was pretty
        active politically during the Vietnam War. We were really active. My mother
        was very progressive, even though she had grown up in a small town, but she
        was college educated and she had a thing with justice. She came from a family
        of lawyers and judges and she had a really strong sense of justice, both local
        and international, in all ways. I think today she would probably have a really
        interesting career. She was a municipal justice of the peace. She did a lot
        of letter writing, you know, letters to the editor. There was a group called
        Another Mother for Peace during the Vietnam War. They read a lot and wrote
        letters. They didn\u2019t pay their telephone tax. The telephone tax, I think,
        supported the Department of Defense but it was directly linked to the Vietnam
        War, the telephone tax. They would go around trying to get people to write
        a letter to the telephone company and not pay their tax. She would arrange
        speakers to come. She would try and get the Berrigan brothers to A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n8\ncome. Because
        I was from Wisconsin, Madison was a real hotbed of anti-war movement. There
        was a bombing and the local people wanted our county to not give money to
        the state to give to the university. It would also affect county extension
        money, which was really important in our area for farming and 4-H. My mother
        arranged for some speakers to come to our little town and do some presentations
        about the war and the University of Wisconsin and how it was all related.
        She actually got death threats. It was really kind of amazing, in a little
        town, in 1968 or 1969. I would pick up the phone and it would be\u2014turns
        out I know who it was now\u2014it was one of my friend\u2019s father, who
        was kind of a crazy man. At the time we didn\u2019t know who it was, but I
        remember him telling me how beautiful it would be seeing my brother and I
        and my parents flying through the air in pieces.\nAW: Oh god, that\u2019s
        awful.\n00:35:40\nLC: Yeah, all because someone comes to your town and speaks
        about something that you don\u2019t agree with, that kind of thing. It was
        really kind of an odd childhood in a certain kind of way. Growing up with
        great beauty and all the charm of a little town but very small-minded. There
        were a lot of very small-minded people. I was lucky to have parents who were
        curious and intellectuals. I don\u2019t know that I would call my dad an intellectual
        but my mother was a real intellectual. Didn\u2019t live an intellectual life
        per se, in her career, but she was concerned with justice, language, words,
        that kind of thing. My dad, he was a map drawer so what I got from him was
        the observation, a way to record observation, or something to do with observation
        that interests you: nature, camping, that kind of thing, sports, I guess.
        I wouldn\u2019t even call it sports. I\u2019d call it moving with a purpose,
        which sports might be part of that, but moving through the landscape with
        a purpose. I had a great childhood in that kind of way; it was really, really,
        rich. But very small-minded\u2014I came out bitter in a certain way towards
        my town and the small-mindedness of it. Bitter? Maybe that\u2019s strong but
        I couldn\u2019t wait to leave. That was the small-mindedness, I mean somebody
        would call you up and threaten your life for your ideas. In my mind, ideas
        were very, very important. My brother, as well, ideas were very, very important
        and what you do with ideas was very important. So to be challenged with your
        life seemed really remarkably bizarre, and I guess it was scary, but not too
        scary.\nI really admired my mother that she could live her ideals and her
        ideas in a little town. It was really remarkable. She was really sort of out
        of place in many ways, I think, and I felt out of place. I was rebellious,
        certainly, but I felt really out of sync with the town. Certainly not out
        of sync with certain parts of it: the aesthetics were really great in so many
        ways. I was really a visual kid and I was not out of place visually but, I
        just looked around and thought, Man, I got to get out of here as quick as
        I can. So I did, but I just wanted out. It just seemed like the women had
        a pretty rough road and when I looked at careers and man, I just didn\u2019t
        see anything there for me. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there as quick
        as I could. It\u2019s interesting now I live in an area where it\u2019s very
        similar, although I live rural, you know, I\u2019m not in the little town.
        I could never live in any of the little towns around me. So I get the benefits
        of a lot of my childhood\u2014I can live out the benefits now; I can pick
        and choose the benefits of it. Yeah, it\u2019s probably pretty different now
        in that little town. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very different. It\u2019s much
        more international now with a high percentage of Somalis live there. I mean
        I think it\u2019s probably a lot richer now. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n9\nThere\u2019s a cross country ski trail there.
        It\u2019s probably really terrific there now; it\u2019s probably really great
        there now. But it was very small-minded. The little newspaper had a gossip
        column: who was serving coffee for who, who was dating who, and our little
        school newspaper was all about gossip, basically, who\u2019s dating who. I
        was the high school yearbook editor as a senior and we wrote about the draft\u2014it
        was during the Vietnam War\u2014and we wrote about what was going on politically,
        and the school told us we couldn\u2019t publish the paper because it wasn\u2019t
        right to write about those things. So we did it anyway. We took over a little
        printing press and did everything by hand and published it anyway, with drawings
        and poetry and things like that. We wrote about what people were worrying
        about. Kids were worrying about the draft and, How come girls weren\u2019t
        drafted? That was a real question that a lot of us girls had. How come the
        boys had to think about this and we didn\u2019t have to think about this?
        How come that is? Why is that? I don\u2019t know; it was like even the teachers
        didn\u2019t want us to raise it as a topic. Most of them didn\u2019t seem
        to care about it and it was always curious to me, Why don\u2019t people care
        about this? That really bothered me. I just felt like I was really out of
        place with my curiosity and my sense of justice and aesthetics. I was really
        upset by things aesthetically\u2014things really bothered me aesthetically.\n00:43:34\nAW:
        Like what?\nLC: Well, that\u2019s a good question. Like what? (Laughs) I guess
        this is your job to do this; this is good. As a kid, even as a little kid,
        some of my earliest memories were\u2014I remember walking down the street
        and I\u2019d look at a building and I\u2019d think, Well, if you put that
        window over there and take that door and move that over there, I really think
        it would look better. In my mind\u2019s eye better, it would look better.
        Well what\u2019s \u201cbetter?\u201d Now I see it as, Well, it\u2019s just
        a visual opportunity and I\u2019m always trying to sort out, What\u2019s the
        information? What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s the information you\u2019re
        given? Given this information\u2014two windows and a door, three windows and
        a door\u2014what\u2019s the most interesting way you could arrange them? What
        do I mean by interesting? What looks pleasing to your eye but also sets up
        a tension or something? What\u2019s a tension that\u2019s interesting, you
        know, besides the given of balance\u2014what most people think looks balanced,
        something you would walk by and not even pay attention to\u2014how could you
        arrange it in a way that you would pay attention to it that\u2019s interesting
        and beautiful? Given just a little set of givens\u2014two windows and a door,
        three windows and a door\u2014how could you set up in a way that\u2019s really
        interesting and beautiful at the same time? Those are the kinds of things
        that I like to do, that I did actually, I couldn\u2019t help myself, couldn\u2019t
        stop myself as a kid. So I was the loiterer, I was the kid that couldn\u2019t
        get anywhere on time because I was interested in what was going on. I realized
        kind of quickly that other kids could give a shit about that, you know, they
        didn\u2019t care about it. Nobody cared about it. Even the adults didn\u2019t
        care about it. So I always felt like I was sort of odd in a way; I always
        had that about me. I kind of did it, I couldn\u2019t help myself; it\u2019s
        probably like being a sociopath or something. There\u2019s probably a word
        for it. It\u2019s probably a diagnosable condition or something. (Laughs)
        I don\u2019t think it really is but it could lead to something like that probably.
        That\u2019s probably what\u2014writers probably have this, artists probably
        have it, architects probably have it, musicians probably have it too\u2014in
        a musical kind of way. You probably can\u2019t help yourself. You can\u2019t
        help paying attention to it. I guess, as I got older, it would lead to, you
        know, if I had been inclined to something like fashion it would have led to
        a fashion career, but I didn\u2019t really care about fashion. I was interested
        in buildings and I think I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n10\ncould
        have been an architect. I actually did try to sign up for architectural drawing,
        but they wouldn\u2019t let girls do it when I was in high school\u2014that
        kind of closed a door on that. When I started taking drawing that was great
        for me because it was a way I could sort of narrow what I was seeing and I
        could pick and choose what I paid attention to visually. Back to your question
        which was\u2014what was your question about?\nAW: About examples of feeling
        frustrated with the aesthetics?\nLC: I think the frustration was realizing
        that I was different in a way from other kids. Other kids didn\u2019t care
        about how things related to each other in a visual way. And then things started
        to bother me\u2014things like little trailer parks, or the way people would
        just throw things away, dumps\u2014I mean, I like dumps; in a certain way
        I liked a lot of dumps, I liked old dumps. But new dumps bothered me aesthetically.
        Even with fashion I was sort of bothered by fashion, I guess. I grew up with
        mostly clothing that my mother had made, and that really bothered me too because
        it wasn\u2019t aesthetically what I would pick. I found it really homely.
        I didn\u2019t necessarily like the fabric. The fabric really bothered me aesthetically
        yet I couldn\u2019t come up with fabric that I would love. I did eventually
        find fabric that I loved, of course. That really bothered me, I felt that
        there was something wrong with me that I couldn\u2019t embrace this. My brother
        couldn\u2019t either and he finally took a stand and said, \u201cNo more,
        I\u2019m not wearing this.\u201d But I felt I had to be polite, so I always
        felt sort of odd at school. There were other kids that grew up that way too.
        We probably could have had a little club together. I always thought boys had
        it a little easier because they could just wear blue jeans and t-shirts.\n00:50:50\nAW:
        Can you describe some of the fabrics or some of the outfits that your mom
        made for you? Were you expected to wear skirts or dresses?\nLC: Oh yeah. We
        had to wear dresses or skirts, even in the wintertime; it\u2019s like bare
        legs; it\u2019s just goofy to walk a mile or so to school. I mean, we\u2019d
        wear snow pants and stuff like that, but I remember really liking pedal pushers
        and we couldn\u2019t wear that at school, but I thought pedal pushers were
        really great. They\u2019re kind of like Capri pants. In the summer I wore
        shorts and jeans and I guess you could say I was a tomboy. I played softball
        and did all that. A lot of girls did that, climbed trees, but, yeah, in school
        you had to wear dresses and skirts. I guess as I got older I sort of found
        things that I like\u2014I like blue denim work shirts. I could accept that
        as an okay thing to wear. I would wear that a lot with a skirt. That was kind
        of odd. People would wear flower prints. I guess as the hippie thing kind
        of settled in, I liked the hippie wardrobe. That was sort of a relief to me.
        I could sort of embrace that. I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from home and
        dress the way I wanted to and feel like I could be myself more. I could be
        myself in my home but I couldn\u2019t be myself in my town or school. I couldn\u2019t
        get excited about school dances and that kind of thing.\nI was the girls\u2019
        track team because I could beat the boys. I was the girls\u2019 track team
        for a year or two and then there was another girl too. We were always better
        or as good as the boys. We had a boys\u2019 track coach that encouraged us
        to run. That was another thing that was kind of a point of difference\u2014feeling
        odd and feeling pride at the same time\u2014kind of bittersweet, kind of a
        skill. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n11\nWe
        would have these all school track meets and I learned early on that I could
        outrun the boys and it was like, Oh wow, really, that\u2019s really interesting\u2014to
        find out something about yourself. It\u2019s like, Oh, I never would have
        thought of that. But then it\u2019s what do you do with it? It was kind of
        an odd skill to have.\nGuess the other nice thing I had from my family, my
        father\u2014we didn\u2019t call it this but he was a cross-country skier.
        Both my brother and I grew up skiing but never remembered learning it. We
        skied as soon as we could stand. We always did that. That was just great.
        When there was too much snow, my dad would do errands for all the old people
        in town. We\u2019d ski around to all the old people\u2019s houses and see
        what they needed and go to the drug store, get their groceries or whatever.
        We\u2019d have packs on. I just thought, God, this is great, really great.
        We had a couple of hills in town. We had one hill, Bull Hill, and there was
        a toboggan slide there. It sort of looked like a ski jump, only it was a slide.
        You\u2019d take your skis off and get a toboggan and climb up and sit on it
        and slide down\u2014god, it was so great. We\u2019d always ski over there
        and go up the toboggan slide on our skis. My dad had been a ski jumper and
        so we would also go around to the ski jumps in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
        My brother and I, our job would be to pack the [snow] where they would jump
        off and they would land. By hand you\u2019d put your skis on and walk up and
        down the hill. I thought, Wow, this is really great. That was really fun.
        I really wanted to be a ski jumper. They didn\u2019t let girls do it and I
        was like, What? You have to be kidding! It was one of those things like when
        I was a girl there were certain things that were closed to you\u2014you couldn\u2019t
        play baseball, you couldn\u2019t be a ski jumper. A lot of things like that.
        It was shocking to me, like, What?! There were a number of great disappointments\u2014it
        was sort of another area where as a girl you would feel different. There were
        opportunities that just were closed to you. There were certain plants you
        couldn\u2019t go visit. I remember my parents were great ones to put us in
        a car and go somewhere and we\u2019d do car camping and then we\u2019d go
        tour something interesting. We\u2019d try get into paper mills or go on to
        ocean liners or things like that. We couldn\u2019t go through a lot of factories\u2014girls,
        my mom and I couldn\u2019t go. My dad and my brother could go but girls and
        women were not allowed, it was too dangerous. What? You have to be kidding
        me. It was just really odd.\n00:58:10\nAW: Did your mom and you ever talk
        about that as you were growing up?\nLC: We would sort of just look at each
        other. My mom would acknowledge it, and she\u2019d just go, \u201cIt\u2019s
        just not right. It\u2019s just not right.\u201d But she got it. She was concerned
        with justice and she got it. I always thought, Why do you live here? Why?
        I don\u2019t get it.\nAW: Why did they live in Barron? Were they born there
        or where did they come from?\nLC: Well, they were both from little towns.
        My mom, she had taught at the University of Minnesota for a year. I don\u2019t
        think my dad wanted to live there; he was no city person at all. He wanted
        to live in a little town. I think it was really important to him to live close
        to nature. I think he would have been happy living kind of like how I live.
        He did a lot of different things for a living, but he was a map drawer but
        he was also a fur trapper and a hunter. That was part of our family\u2019s
        income, so he couldn\u2019t really do that in a city. But he was outside a
        lot of the time. He A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n12\nreally
        was able to kind of do what he liked doing\u2014being outside a lot. My mother,
        through her family, she inherited a little tiny business, which people don\u2019t
        have any more\u2014it\u2019s like when you buy a piece of property or a house,
        you get an abstract which shows a history of the land. So my dad would draw
        all the maps and then he had a printing press and then he would draw the maps
        and then transfer them to a plate and make these maps. That was really interesting
        to me. Kind of like the creamery butter makers, I loved being with him because
        I could watch him make the maps and then get the plate ready, put it on the
        press. He could hear when the press\u2014when something was wrong he could
        hear it and he\u2019d tinker with it. It was a pretty big press by today\u2019s
        standards. It was really a beautiful process. He could draw with both hands;
        he could make a beautiful line. So beautiful to watch him draw. It was really
        great, so I spent a lot of time watching him draw and then he taught me how
        to draw with his tools. I have his tools and I don\u2019t draw that way at
        all now but I love trying. It\u2019s a very obscure way to draw with pen and
        ink. He used these beautiful tools that were basically two pieces of steel
        that had a little channel in them and there was a little screw with a thumbscrew
        and you could adjust the width of the line with this little thumbscrew and
        you\u2019d dip it into ink, and you were sort of right or wrong. Over time
        you develop a skill, which is to very decisively make a line with a certain
        width. You develop a touch for it where you have a sense of conviction that
        you\u2019re going to be successful making this line, and you develop an ability
        to make a beautiful line with conviction. It\u2019s the same kind of skill
        that you have to have if you play music or if you\u2019re a surgeon, or whatever
        your practice is, if you\u2019re a writer\u2014if you do something daily over
        time, it\u2019s your practice\u2014you develop a sense of touch with your
        material. My father had that with pen and ink and the line. It was a beautiful
        thing, very beautiful thing, and I loved that about his skill. That was really
        important to me to see someone who had a daily practice, didn\u2019t matter
        what it was, but those were the people I paid attention to as a kid. I\u2019m
        kind of putting it together now, thank you: the butter maker, the guy with
        the shovel and the coal, my dad with his pen and ink, my mom in a justice
        kind of way, daily practice of justice. Those were the people that I paid
        attention to. Those were my role models, those people that did something with
        conviction. I think that\u2019s probably all I was looking for was a way to
        have a daily practice with conviction, with aesthetics and using my hands
        and moving through the landscape with a purpose. I think that\u2019s it. That\u2019s
        kind of it in a nutshell; that\u2019s sort of all I ever wanted to do. And
        have great meaning to some of it, or enough meaning to make it worth getting
        up in the morning and wanting to keep doing it. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve
        ever wanted in my life.\n01:05:03\nThe other thing I think I probably got
        from my dad\u2014I think I talked about observation and being a detective.
        I guess because my dad was a fur trapper, it was fascinating to me as a child\u2014I
        would go with my father on his trap line. It was sort of like having dairy
        cows where you have to attend to them twice a day. You attend to them, or
        you don\u2019t do that activity. He would basically go on a hike twice a day,
        and basically his job was to observe what\u2019s going on\u2014who\u2019s
        walking where (in terms of the animals)? Who\u2019s walking where, how are
        they living, what are they doing, where are they moving? Basically he would
        try to trick them with their materials and his trap. That was basically what
        he was doing. He would set a trap by observing where to put it; he would try
        to trick them and then he would check the traps and find out if he was right
        or wrong. Obviously, when he was right he would harvest them and take them
        home and process them in a certain way and then sell them and get money for
        them. That was basically my college money, or A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n13\na lot of my college money was
        from that. He actually gave me a sock full of money with all the money I had
        earned with my trap line. That\u2019s another story, but it was interesting
        through observation and physical activity\u2014which was a beautiful activity,
        going on a hike with snowshoe or ski with a pack and equipment and setting
        up a situation, and being right or wrong. It didn\u2019t matter if you were
        wrong because the hike was beautiful. Through time, repetition, going to the
        same place over time, observation\u2014to me, that was so important in my
        childhood: observing the same thing over and over as the seasons change. It
        really gave me a love of being outdoors and moving. When people ask me why
        I live where I live, I could never really figure it out. Now I think I figured
        it out\u2014basically I re-created an environment where I am able to work
        here, I\u2019m able to isolate myself where I can have a daily practice with
        very few distractions. It\u2019s kind of a base camp where I can come and
        go. Obviously I can go for work and travel, but basically I can be reclusive
        in my studio and I\u2019m happy. Happy is a funny word but I set up an opportunity
        where I can get something done and not be distracted. And yet I have a whole
        world, or I can hike and ski and canoe even in the spring in a place where
        I have a daily rhythm to being outside. I probably didn\u2019t say that very
        well, but I\u2019m able to be outside moving in the landscape and I don\u2019t
        have to drive anywhere. I can just go out my door. I really enjoy that. I\u2019ve
        been able to recreate that part of my childhood here. It\u2019s really odd
        when I see it that way but I think that\u2019s part of why I settled here.
        Obviously it was cheap land too; it was inexpensive\u2014that was part of
        it too. I can have a wood kiln here and make a big fire and have smoke and
        nobody can find me. That\u2019s part of it too.\n01:10:24\nAW: What were your
        parents\u2019 names?\nLC: My dad\u2019s name was Glenn, and my mother\u2019s
        name was Elizabeth\u2014though she went by Betty.\nAW: You said they were
        from small towns in the Midwest or Wisconsin?\nLC: Wisconsin.\nAW: So they
        were both from Wisconsin. What is your brother\u2019s name?\nLC: Peter. My
        dad came from a Norwegian family and his parents never spoke English. I\u2019m
        pretty sure he was very ashamed of his family in that way. I think he was
        the only person in his siblings to go to college. I think he worked very,
        very hard to get away from that culture of not being able to read and write.
        He really did an astounding thing in his family and I\u2019m only really able
        to see that now. My brother and I talk about it that it was really remarkable.
        My mother came from a family of lawyers and judges, and she did an astounding
        thing by marrying someone of a lower class who she recognized as an intellectual
        match and a very kind person who was able to get her out of doors, which was
        something her family didn\u2019t do. They were really remarkable people in
        that they were able to find what they needed in each other. I don\u2019t think
        I realized that as a child, but as an adult, of course, we look back and see
        these things. But they ended up in a small town and it\u2019s kind of too
        bad in a way; I think my mother ended up living close to her family, so she
        was probably a little restrained in her life. I think she was A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n14\nsomeone who was
        depressed, I think, her life, and my father was a sort of happy go lucky and
        content, he had great peace of mind. My mother, I think she was clinically
        depressed. My father was great for her to be around, but she was someone who
        never shined and she was really brilliant. She did really great things in
        many ways but I think given a different circumstance I think she would have\u2014I
        don\u2019t know what she would have done but she could have been a writer,
        or she could have been like someone like Madeline Albright. She could have
        worked in an international relations kind of way either through a non-profit
        or a government sort of way. Very progressive person.\nAW: You said she also
        was college educated. What was her major?\nLC: She took a Home Ec. degree,
        and I think that\u2019s sort of what people did back then, what girls, young
        women did. She never really worked in Home Ec. She taught for a little while.
        She taught in the School of Nursing at the University of Minnesota. I think
        she taught nutrition. She wasn\u2019t happy doing that. She didn\u2019t want
        to be a nutritionist or teach nutrition, she didn\u2019t want to teach Home
        Ec. My father had been trained to teach shop\u2014woodshop. You learn tools
        and that is what he was trained to teach. They went to a place called Stout
        State in Menominee.\n01:15:35\nAW: Is that were they met?\nLC: Yeah, that\u2019s
        where they met. My mom played the string bass and my dad asked her if he could
        help her carry it. She was like six foot tall and skinny and she could carry
        it just fine, but that\u2019s how they met.\nTM: Did she teach herself bass?\nLC:
        No, she learned in high school. She learned starting in grade school, but
        she never really pursued it. I never heard her play. I never would have considered
        her a musician per se, but she insisted that both my brother and I take piano
        so we each grew up playing the piano from a young age.\nAW: Do you still play
        piano?\nLC: I play a little bit but I wouldn\u2019t say I have a daily practice.\nAW:
        You were talking about her work to bring speakers to the town. You said she
        tried to get the Berrigan brothers to come. Did they come through?\nLC: They
        didn\u2019t come, but there were two other priests who came.\nAW: Do you remember
        who they were?\nLC: They were well known people. Not as well known as the
        Berrigan brothers but I could probably find out their names. I couldn\u2019t
        tell you offhand, but they would be recognizable names A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n15\nfor scholars of that time
        period or activists of that time period would know who they were. I think
        they were from Vermont. They would go around to colleges and speak. My brother
        was also really interesting in his background because he\u2014we have basically
        the same issues from our family, like everyone does, and our childhood but
        from our small town\u2014he, as a sophomore in college, he was very upset\u2014I
        hope I get the story right\u2014but he was upset about some remarks the president
        of University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2014that\u2019s where he went to school\u2014the
        university president had made a comment during a public talk about the anti-war
        movement and the students at Madison\u2014he made a statement that my brother
        found was provocative or disagreeable. So he made an appointment to talk to
        the president and interview him on this point because he was a journalism
        major. Through that chance event he would meet with the president every so
        often and they would discuss things. It grew into\u2014well, the president
        and his wife live in a mansion and they need someone who always is present
        there and lives there, and it usually is a student. They asked my brother
        if he would want to do that. He actually moved into their house\u2014they
        had an apartment for a caretaker. He lived there for a lot of his school years.
        He went to graduate school and lived there and he went to law school and he
        lived there. He was older than me and I didn\u2019t quite get at the time
        what a remarkable thing this was about my brother. He also followed a hunch.
        He was like a detective, too, in a certain way. He would follow a hunch and
        it would lead somewhere really fascinating and interesting. Like my father,
        and my mother, he was very good with people and finding great things, finding
        great meaning through interesting people, and following a trail of clues.
        In a way that\u2019s sort of what I do but with visual\u2014it\u2019s a visual
        problem, or a visual opportunity with material and tools. But it\u2019s basically
        kind of the same thing, I think of it as kind of the same thing. An opportunity,
        setting up a problem with restrictions, seeing what\u2019s going on, and then
        coming up with a hypothesis or something that you\u2019re really interested
        in and following it. My brother sort of does the same thing, sort of what
        my dad did, it\u2019s sort of what my mom did, but my visual way was just
        something I couldn\u2019t help myself with. I couldn\u2019t see anything better,
        I guess.\n01:22:02\nAW: Let\u2019s talk about that more. What were some of
        your early experiences with art? You said you had taken a drawing class. When
        did you first get into ceramics? Or were there other artistic passions that
        you had?\nLC: As a kid, I always made things; I mean, I always made things.
        It was just what I did as a kid. What I really remember is either being outside,
        just sitting on the ground, just playing with sticks and stones. Just training
        to rearrange them\u2014given this, two sticks and a stone, make something
        out of it. This sounds weird, but\u2014I don\u2019t think my parents were
        cruel\u2014but I was a kid that just took off, so I actually had a little
        harness and I was actually on a little thing by a tree. I don\u2019t have
        a lot of memories about it, but I\u2019m starting to remember some things
        about it. Honestly, I could just sit there with three sticks and a stone,
        and, Wow, this is great. Just make the best of it. So arranging things. Again\u2014they
        were not cruel to me but I took off, I guess. I\u2019m sort of remembering
        more of that, just sitting there, unable to run but unable to figure out how
        to get out of it\u2014I wasn\u2019t quite Houdini. (Laughs) But that was enough
        to occupy myself; that was plenty. As a kid I remember when my grandmother
        was in and out of hospitals and my mom would take me and then she would just
        sort of park me somewhere with paper and pencil and coloring books. I remember
        being under stairs\u2014I would always go under stairs somewhere by a window
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n16\nwhere
        I could sit and draw. I thought that was really great. I just liked doing
        that. I would sort of venture around to the kitchens where they would have
        the hospital kitchens and I would sort of get to know the cooks and then I
        would sit in the kitchen sometimes; I would draw the kitchen. When I think
        about it now, I would probably sit in the employee lunchroom or I would sit
        on the floor and watch the people cook. That was fascinating too, so I was
        sort of drawing whatever was there. So basically being alone, finding\u2014through
        observation\u2014on my own I found a purpose, it was meaningful to me, I found
        something that was engaging, aesthetically. I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily
        that I was good at this or say I had great skill. I wouldn\u2019t say I was
        talented in anyway whatsoever but, I really liked doing it. It was just fine
        by me to be by myself under the stairs, tied up to a tree, it was great. I
        was fine. No problem. (Laughs) But again\u2014they were not being cruel at
        all. I would not see it that way. I was like the kid, if we would go to a
        store somewhere in a big city, I was off and running and lost and enjoying
        it. I think it came from that. Just trying to keep me safe, really. I feel
        like I\u2019m defending them now, I should defend them.\n01:27:10\nAW: It
        sounds like you like to explore on your own so I could understand that your
        mom wanted to see you at all times.\nLC: I did run everywhere. I never walked
        as a kid; I always ran, I always ran.\nAW: So were there art opportunities
        at your school that you could take?\nLC: Not really. I have to think back
        to it. I remember being really frustrated in, like, kindergarten: it was like
        I was so excited that you could draw and have real paint and all that and
        I guess I was never the kid that would like to draw the turkey with your fingers
        and here\u2019s the colors. I wouldn\u2019t say I got reprimanded for it but
        I always felt that it wasn\u2019t quite right. I would always look for the
        other opportunities like architectural drawing, industrial arts\u2014that\u2019s
        what my father was trained to teach: industrial arts. But I really liked industrial
        arts because you could cut things up free form, even though you were supposed
        to make a shoe shine kit or a duck or something, I liked industrial arts a
        lot. I did take every art class you could take and I remember the first art
        class\u2014sculpture was being given a bar of ivory soap and you could carve
        it. That\u2019s what sculpture was. I was like, Really? I mean I probably
        made sculpture as a child, that\u2019s probably what it was. I think all kids\u2014I
        don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it art\u2014but all kids play with material
        and in other cultures it would be called art, or some cultures would call
        it art. But all children probably rearrange natural materials and play with
        color and line. It just seemed like art class wasn\u2019t what I thought it
        would be. When I took the first drawing class\u2014it really wasn\u2019t a
        class, but it was when we drew in art class. I think in high school you could
        finally take a class where you could draw. I just thought, Wow, this is great.
        This is fantastic! Not that I was good at it\u2014I was not good at it\u2014but
        the fact that the teacher\u2014I\u2019ll never forget it\u2014he set up a
        still life with a box of matches and a candle and I was like, Wow, this is
        really great. I could do this forever. I was in heaven. I just thought it
        was, Wow, and then, Wow, maybe he could help me draw better.\n01:30:59\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n17\nThe
        idea that you could have an art teacher\u2014I just found that so optimistic.
        I was just thrilled that somebody could actually help me. I just could hardly
        stand it, the idea of it, almost. Our art teacher was Mr. Muller and he taught
        art\u2014I don\u2019t think we ever had it in grade school\u2014but in junior
        high. I never got it in junior high because girls had to take Home Ec. The
        boys could take art or industrial arts and the girls could take Home Ec. and
        Industrial Arts. I don\u2019t think I could take art in junior high, so high
        school was a time when I could take it as an elective. I was taking advanced
        writing and chemistry. I always did well in school and school was easy for
        me so I always took advanced classes and it suddenly occurred to me that,
        Oh, I should take art, when I was a senior. I dropped out of the advanced
        classes and signed up for this art class. Oh my god, I can hardly believe
        it. The teacher, bless his heart, he was a wildlife artist, a duck artist.
        His forte was drawing ducks and geese and the swamp kind of landscape. Maybe
        he became a duck stamp artist\u2014he would be that kind of person, working
        with charcoal and watercolor and pencil. He was really good at it in a certain
        style. I don\u2019t know that he really was a great artist or a great teacher.
        I don\u2019t feel like he really helped me much. When I think of an art teacher
        now I think of somebody who can really help you grow. That\u2019s a little
        bit of the college teaching I do and have done. My goal is to help people
        learn skills obviously but also to help them grow in their vision\u2014help
        them grow as fast as you can. I don\u2019t feel like he had that part of him,
        which was too bad because I was so moldable and eager. But I was happy to
        just try and be there in the class. I really had a love for drawing. The fact
        that somebody legitimized it, you know, that is a valid thing\u2014this isn\u2019t
        just a quirky thing that I do because that\u2019s what I do. It was really
        nice to have it legitimized. He had in the back room a potter\u2019s wheel,
        which was like a record player\u2014it was on or off. It had a little switch
        and it sat on a table. I think it was made by a company called Amaco. It was
        a little metal\u2014like a record player. He had a bag of clay and he didn\u2019t
        know how to use it and we never did use it. So I took the bag of clay out
        one time and I got it out and I put it on the wheel and I put some water on
        it\u2014it seemed too dry\u2014and I turned it on and immediately couldn\u2019t
        do it. I thought, Wow, this must be really hard. This is impossible\u2014how
        do people do this? It just didn\u2019t make any sense to me. That was sort
        of my beginning to think about, Wow, I could make a pot. I did try.\nMy other
        paying attention to pots was from growing up\u2014we didn\u2019t have any
        handmade things in our home that were pottery. We didn\u2019t have pots at
        all. We had a couple paintings. We had clothing, obviously, that my mother
        made. My father was a knitter so we had some things he had knit. He knit stocking
        caps; basically, that was his forte. My mother knitted Norwegian patterned
        socks and things like that. So we did have some handmade things but no real
        art. Not much of that around. We had a lot of books, a lot of books. So that
        was important\u2014books, you know, which were handmade\u2014someone handmade
        a book. We had a lot of music, that\u2019s handmade. But in terms of visual
        art, not so much. But I started collecting a few pottery things, kind of oddly,
        in seventh grade, maybe. I would get them at dumps, you know, farm dumps,
        I would get pieces.\nWe always had crocks around, through pickling, but they
        weren\u2019t considered art or anything. I sort of got interested in canning
        jars, and I started collecting ceramic canning jars, in seventh grade, I think.
        I also bought a pump organ at a farm auction at the same farm auction that
        I started getting these canning jars at. These canning jars were thrown in
        a mold and then they had a screw top lid made out of zinc, and I just thought
        that was really beautiful, the zinc on the screw top. I just thought they
        were really beautiful. I liked the idea that\u2014it really interested me
        that it was a metal lid on a piece of ceramics. That really was a wild idea
        to me; it was a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n18\nrevolutionary
        idea. It\u2019s really not that revolutionary because I had been using them
        with glass, a glass canning jar with a screw top lid. That\u2019s what people
        used. After the screw top lid came the rubber ring and the little flat dome
        and then the separate screw ring. But this was the lid and ring as one, and
        it was a beautiful thing. So I recognized that in seventh grade\u2014that
        this is a pot with a utilitarian purpose that is actually beautiful in a way
        that sets up attention\u2014this zinc lid and this beautiful mechanically
        made pot with some odd little hand touches in the stenciling and the denting
        of the lid where the hand touches the mechanical. I thought, Wow, this is
        beautiful. But I couldn\u2019t have diagnosed it, or visually taken it apart
        at that point as a child. I couldn\u2019t have told you why it was beautiful
        like I can critically take it apart now and analyze it. I could write a thesis
        on it. I could write a paper on that one pot. That was sort of a revolution
        for me in my thinking about or considering pottery as something other than
        a utilitarian object. It had an aesthetic power and mystery all on its own.\n01:40:05\nI
        still have that canning jar, actually. I don\u2019t have a lot of things from
        my childhood. I have my skis that I grew up with and they are some of the
        most beautiful things. My dad actually made them for me. They\u2019re so beautiful.
        He made them from a nail barrel and he painted them yellow. They\u2019re so
        beautiful. They\u2019re the kind of thing if I saw at an auction that I would
        try and get them. But the fact that he made them, they\u2019re beautiful,
        they\u2019re functional, and I learned to ski on them. My brother learned,
        and my daughter learned\u2014a lot of kids learned to ski on them.\nAW: The
        same skis?\nLC: The same skis. They\u2019re so beautiful. It\u2019s the aesthetically
        pleasing object that is a tool, a tool in the way that it\u2019s useful. It\u2019s
        got everything you want visually, aesthetically, and as a tool, or utilitarian
        object. It\u2019s got it all.\nAW: When did you get a chance to take a pottery
        class?\nLC: Not till college really and I just kind of stumbled on it. I was
        an art major and a music major at the same time. I had to pick and I kind
        of liked them both equally, but I picked art because I had performance anxiety
        and I was really shy. As a person I was very shy and easily intimidated. It
        was just really hard for me to perform. It was really hard. Nowadays you can
        take classes in it, take drugs for it, and get help with it. But it just never
        occurred to me to ask for help. I picked art. I thought, Great, I\u2019ll
        never ever have to do anything in public. This is great! That\u2019s what
        I thought. It\u2019s really funny now looking back. It\u2019s funny that I
        would think that, but that\u2019s really what I thought: I can hide, basically,
        great. It never occurred to me to take ceramics. It never would have occurred
        to me. But when I was taking requirements the last requirement I had to take\u2014before
        you had to specialize\u2014I had to choose between printmaking or ceramics.
        The printmaking teacher\u2014I was just terrified of him. He had a temper,
        he was very short, and he looked like Hitler\u2014or the pictures of Hitler
        that I had seen\u2014and people behind his back, rather cruelly, referred
        to him as \u201cLittle Hitler.\u201d I was terrified of him and I was like,
        Gosh, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to take a class from him, even though
        I\u2019d never met him but I had seen him around, and people\u2019s stories.
        I just was like, Hm-mmm, no way. In hindsight? Wow, I would have loved printmaking,
        in hindsight. I think I would have just loved it. The fact that you could
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n19\ntake
        drawing\u2014what\u2019s drawing? Making a line. Take some lines, assemble
        the lines in a certain way, make the lines in a very unusual way with these
        unusual tools on a plate. Oh my god, I would have loved it. Lithography, I
        think I would have loved lithography. It\u2019s not too late. (Laughs) I could
        still love it. But to develop touch and a daily discipline, well, it\u2019s
        probably too late with me for that. But I really think lithography\u2014I
        love that litho crayon\u2014I think it\u2019s called a crayon, I\u2019m out
        of my element but the big stone, the litho stone, and the motion with the
        crayon. I love making a line, in general, and I think of pottery as three-dimensional
        making of a line. I know that sounds odd, but it\u2019s making a line in a
        certain way with a certain tool. I think the litho stone\u2014I think it\u2019s
        called a stone\u2014but I think I would love to make a line with the litho
        crayon and the litho stone. I think I would love that. I probably should do
        that. I should write a grant and do that, but I don\u2019t have a touch for
        it, and I\u2019m na\u00efve, I don\u2019t know a thing about it.\n01:45:52\nOh,
        so I didn\u2019t do the printmaking\u2014too bad really, as an aside\u2014so
        I took ceramics. I just signed up for the class. I made some great friends
        there. I made some lifelong friends there. One of my best friends ever is
        a photographer and I met her in that class. I just re-met a fellow, who just
        took a class from me, I just re-met one of my old classmates from one of my
        first ceramics classes. I just had no idea what to expect and I just showed
        up. I bought the little tools that you buy. I bought the textbook\u2014there
        was only one book you could buy and I bought that little book and showed up.
        I was that kid that just couldn\u2019t get it. I just couldn\u2019t get it.
        The teacher would demonstrate and, \u201cHere\u2019s how you do it,\u201d
        and it looked so easy. I just thought, Oh my god. This is going to be great!
        Because I touched the clay and it was like, This is so good! Oh god, I can\u2019t
        believe how good this feels. Wow, it\u2019s so plastic. It just felt right.
        It just felt so luscious and oh, it just had these great qualities. You roll
        it in your hand and make a little snake and, Oh, my god, it just felt so good.
        Then I\u2019d get it on the wheel and it was just like, Oh, shit, this is
        horrible. I can\u2019t do this! Oh god. And I\u2019m that kid that was like:
        just keep at it, keep at it, keep at it, keep at it. Above anything I\u2019m
        persistent, so I just kept at it. Basically I\u2019m still that kid, just
        keeping at it. None of it comes easy for me. I don\u2019t know, maybe there\u2019s
        just something about it\u2014I still have that sense of wonder or that tactile
        thing. I still have that love of how it feels. That\u2019s not enough to sustain
        your interest or your career or your problem-solving or your intellect, but
        I recognize that I still have those little moments of, Oh my god, this feels
        so good and so right. But I was the bumbling, unskilled\u2014it was just really,
        really frustrating.\nLC: It was just really hard. I was so lucky in so many
        ways for all of us in general\u2014being in the right place at the right time
        with the right people\u2014I felt like I was just out of this world lucky.
        The first teacher I had\u2014it was unbelievable. The teacher we were supposed
        to have got arrested for making LSD. He and one other person got arrested,
        and they got hauled away to federal prison. The school didn\u2019t know what
        to do; it was like school was ready to start and they didn\u2019t have a teacher
        so they pulled one of the best students from the University of Minnesota who
        happened to be this guy Mark Pharis, who\u2019s really an incredible potter.
        He was a student at the time. He was just a few years older than me. So they
        brought him in, so he left school\u2014he never went back to school and he\u2019s
        been a dean at the University of Minnesota. It\u2019s really great. No, he
        never got his undergraduate degree. He\u2019s been a terrific teacher and
        a terrific potter, and a dean at the U of M. It\u2019s just so great. So they
        brought him in and he didn\u2019t have a studio of his own so A Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n20\nhe would work at
        night. When he wasn\u2019t teaching he would work in our classroom. That was
        fantastic.\n01:50:32\nSo even though I was bumbling and couldn\u2019t get
        it, I watched a lot. It didn\u2019t occur to me to ask for help. I was pretty
        shy and I had long hair and I just kind of kept my head down and kept trying.
        I didn\u2019t ask for help, really. So I was slow to pick up any skills. I
        just bumbled. I always got A\u2019s probably because I tried so hard. As a
        teacher, how do you grade students who work really hard, try really hard,
        they\u2019re in there all the time but they can\u2019t get it? If they\u2019re
        a football player and they can\u2019t throw the ball, or if they\u2019re a
        violinist and they can\u2019t pull the bow across the string\u2014it\u2019s
        really not different than putting your hands on the clay on the wheel or making
        a slab. I don\u2019t know, I had teachers who must have been kind to me because
        I always got A\u2019s, but I was a bumbler. Bumble, bumble. I don\u2019t know
        why I kept at it because it was so hard. I guess because I could see hope.
        I had hope because I kind of saw the politics of it. I saw what a pot could
        do. I saw that it could be a useful object or tool that could stand on its
        own as a visual object. It could hold a sense of visual weight that was as
        interesting or as compelling as, say, a painting or a drawing. It was a three-dimensional
        drawing, to me, or that\u2019s how I came to see my interest. It was drawing
        in 3D on a material that was plastic and engaging in a tactile way. But then
        it would become hard and it would become something else that had the potential
        to be both useful and beautiful and have a visual tension that is somehow
        compelling to me\u2014maybe not to others, but to me. It was a worthwhile
        effort even if I wasn\u2019t good at it. I could see maybe it was worth keeping
        on. I never set out to be a potter or have a career in it, but I never saw
        a reason to stop. I never was so hopeless or found anything that was as meaningful
        that I would want to quit. I basically always found a way to keep doing it.
        That was sort of my modus\u2014just keep at it until you\u2019re either beat
        down by it\u2014I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way but because it was so
        hard for me, it was evident that I could get beat down by it, or it would
        lose its sense of purpose, or I would find something that felt more important
        to me to do. I\u2019m not sure what \u201cimportant\u201d would really mean.\nI
        did also have a nagging\u2014I don\u2019t know what you would call it\u2014but
        maybe this is where my sense of justice?\u2014maybe justice is the wrong word,
        but I felt that pottery wasn\u2019t important in the way that say political
        art would have. I would look at a lot of prints by someone like Goya who would
        make prints about a war or people who were war correspondents and took photographs
        of battle, or did drawings about war, or made visual work\u2014a film, a photograph,
        a drawing, a print\u2014that actually was not just a tool or something beautiful
        but it was something that would change the world. It was like pottery changing
        the world. The teacher that I had, Mark Pharis, and some of his friends, Wayne
        Branum\u2014they really thought that pots could change the world, and the
        whole hippie thing going on\u2014I was sort of a hippie\u2014you know, it
        was like you change the world through your politics. There\u2019s a lot to
        criticize about it and laugh at it about it, but basically the idea that you
        could change the world through your behavior or your personal politics could
        actually change the world. I bought in to that to a certain degree, but, in
        terms of aesthetics, for many, many years, I always had this thought\u2014this
        nagging thing\u2014it\u2019s really not enough, it\u2019s not enough just
        to make a cup. You should be changing the world or stopping a war or fighting
        for the rights of this class of people. It was sort of hard to make a case
        for a cup having that sort of intellectual weight. Go to court\u2014can you
        make a logical case and show the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n21\nevidence that a cup will change the world? This
        is a true statement\u2014a cup will change the world. I actually came around
        to seeing that a cup has the capacity to change someone\u2019s world. Making
        a cup has the capacity to change my world, my world of aesthetics and daily
        practice, the touch of the material, my sense of opportunity within the material.
        A cup has the capacity to be enough. But I also have some other interests
        and other materials, and I also work with other materials and I don\u2019t
        have to work all my aesthetic problems with ceramics or pottery. I have other
        visual problems and opportunities that I\u2018m interested in that has nothing
        to do with pottery. That was a relief to accept that about myself that pottery
        is enough but I also have some other interests and other materials which I
        work with. I do not have a daily practice with those materials like I do with
        ceramics, so I\u2019m not na\u00efve that that other work is as developed
        or ever could be as developed as say my ceramic work is. We need to touch
        things every day or nearly every day to have a sense of touch and confidence
        with a material. But I did come around to seeing that a pot has a certain
        weight which is important in a certain way. It\u2019s restrictive in many,
        many ways, and once I came to accept those restrictions there\u2019s a universe
        of opportunity. That was a relief to me to be able to figure that out but
        of course that takes a long time and as a student and then I went on to do
        some graduate work after that\u2014that really nagged at me because some of
        my friends were doing important art with printmaking and photography. I always
        felt sheepish, Oh, it\u2019s just a pot, it\u2019s just a cup, it\u2019s just
        a plate, it\u2019s just a bowl\u2014you know you could live your whole life
        like that\u2014I\u2019m just a girl, I come from a little town\u2014it just
        fit into that same thing for me. [Interview Break]\n02:00:51\nAW: Before we
        took a break, you were telling us about being in a pottery class and reflecting
        on pottery as changing the world. If we could back up a little bit\u2014when
        you finished high school, when was that?\nLC: 1970.\nAW: You were reflecting
        earlier that you just wanted to get out of Barron, Wisconsin. Tell us what
        was your thought process then about where you wanted to go? What you wanted
        to do?\nLC: I remembered being pretty scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do.
        I didn\u2019t really know where to go. It was pretty different then. You couldn\u2019t
        go online to look at colleges. Through my church, our church offered scholarships
        to two schools, you could go to Hamline or you could go to Lawrence University
        in Appleton. I thought I should go to Hamline because it seemed more exotic
        because it was in a different state, though it turned out to be closer to
        my hometown than Appleton was. I didn\u2019t do my research. (Laughs) But
        that\u2019s sort of what I thought: I\u2019ll go to one of those. Or I could
        have gone to Madison but I didn\u2019t want to do that because my brother
        was there. I auditioned for a music scholarship, I remember doing that. The
        Methodist church, because Hamline was associated with the Methodist church,
        you could get a scholarship through there. It seemed like the thing to do
        not really knowing much about anything. I just remember being really scared,
        excited but scared, super scared and very shy. I walked into my dorm room\u2014when
        my parents said goodbye to me, my dad gave me a wool sock with this money
        in\u2014my dad had a trap line and I helped him but then I had my own trap
        line. He took all the money and put it in a sock and gave it to me for school,
        for college. I remember standing holding this A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n22\nwool sock full of money, which
        is really kind of weird, looking at my dorm mate\u2019s dresser\u2014I hadn\u2019t
        met her yet, she\u2019d moved in\u2014and on her dresser was a big fancy makeup
        mirror with lights and she had these trays, it was like a gallery of cosmetics.
        I didn\u2019t know what any of it was. I remember looking at my bag and then
        at this tray of cosmetics and I thought, Oh, what am I in for? I don\u2019t
        know what I\u2019m doing! I just felt so out of place. I was so excited and
        then I was like, I don\u2019t know about this. It was pretty scary. It ended
        up I had a great roommate. I just saw her, last month. We just came from such
        different places. That\u2019s what college is all about, really, navigating
        through life where everything is different from what you know, which is how
        it is supposed to be. She was perfect.\n02:04:45\nAW: What were your first
        impressions of St. Paul?\nLC: It seemed awfully big. It seemed noisy. It seemed
        really exciting. I didn\u2019t know this at the time\u2014I\u2019m somebody
        who is too easily stimulated. I have a hard time shutting my brain off. Falling
        asleep can be hard. I didn\u2019t know that about myself that I really need
        quiet. I\u2019m just really overly stimulated visually. It was very exciting
        and I had a hard time sleeping. Once I got that figured out, it was great.
        I loved going to museums and going to hear music. I wasn\u2019t really a bar
        person. I wasn\u2019t too interested in that kind of thing. I remember I met\u2014Patti
        Smith came to our college and I just saw a poster and here\u2019s a picture
        of Patti Smith\u2014I didn\u2019t know who she was\u2014I just showed up.
        Nobody I knew would go and I just showed up and I remember there were like
        ten people in the room with Patti Smith. She was reading her poetry and singing
        a little. I think my jaw just dropped. I was like, Wow, this is so great.
        Patti Smith! I had never heard of her. That was incredible. Things like that
        were great\u2014really great music and theater and dance. That was really
        fantastic. I loved the whole intellectual life. I really liked that. I didn\u2019t
        like the dorm life so much; even then I was a solitary person. I read this
        description on a book jacket for the Annie Dillard wrote, on the back of the
        book where it has a little thing about the author, and it says, \u201cAnnie
        Dillard,\u201d and then it said, \u201cgregarious recluse.\u201d I thought,
        Oh, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m a gregarious recluse. I love people when I\u2019m
        with them but I am inclined to be on my own.\nSo it was hard living in a dorm.
        Plus I couldn\u2019t go outside that much. That was really weird. That part
        I found really hard, you know, being a young woman and you couldn\u2019t walk
        around at night. I never felt safe and people would tell you not to. During
        the day it was not such a thing. People hitchhiked all the time, so I hitchhiked.
        I hitchhiked by myself, that was fine, but never at night. But I felt like
        I sort of had good street smarts on my own, I don\u2019t know why. I guess
        just from observing nature, I observe people in the same way I would observe
        nature. When I would go out for a walk or go somewhere on a bus, I was somebody
        that could quickly suss out if something seemed kind of dicey or threatening.
        When an animal is threatened, an animal emits a certain look or energy\u2014it\u2019s
        like my radar was attuned to be aware of what\u2019s around me. It wasn\u2019t
        all that hard.\nBehind the ceramics studio there was a big hill. There was
        a track, like an athletic track, but then there was a big hill. Down at the
        bottom of the hill was the East West Railroad tracks. Big, lot of railroad
        tracks. By the railroad tracks was a factory. It was called Koppers, I think
        that\u2019s with a K. K-o-p-p-e-r-s Coke, C-o-k-e. It was a plant where it
        operated twenty-four hours a day. I think A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n23\nthey burned coal in an atmosphere that didn\u2019t
        have enough oxygen. It is coke that is used to make steel. It was this plant
        that ran twenty-four hours a day. It became my creamery. I would go there
        at night and watch, and it was just fantastic, it was so beautiful. There
        were these kilns or ovens. I don\u2019t know what temperature it was, but
        it must have been over two thousand degrees. A door would open and this molten
        coke would get pushed out into a railroad car and the railroad car was pulled
        by a locomotive and the locomotive would pull ahead at the proper rate so
        the car would be filled up with this orange white hot coke. So at night it
        was fantastic to watch. It was so beautiful. It would drive to a big shed
        and they would have big hoses full of water would cool it down so that these
        big white clouds\u2014and with the light from the city\u2014it was just so
        beautiful. It was timed. You could time it on your watch. I went back later
        on and took a photo class and I made a little documentary on the plant and
        the workers. I really liked that kind of observation, kind of like being a
        sociologist, documentarian. I really liked that kind of project. Sometimes
        I feel like I could have chosen things a little differently and I could have
        gone into that kind of work, like photojournalism, or photographer, or sociologist.\n02:11:40\nLC:
        Yeah, I liked having something between me and what I was looking at. That
        something was a frame. I realized I really liked that and that I\u2019ve always
        loved framing things. It\u2019s my nature to always make a frame either kind
        of with my hand or I see a frame that that\u2019s part of how I see. I\u2019m
        not someone who is constantly scanning. People see in different ways, and
        I realized that when I started using a camera that that\u2019s what I liked
        about it. That was kind of shocking and neat in a similar way. And I like
        the gadgetry about it. I liked the developing and I liked the smell of the
        developer and the fixer. I liked being in the dark room. I liked the process.
        It was really nice. I didn\u2019t feel like I had a very good handle on the
        technical part, though, and to take photography at our school it was all through
        independent study. I really needed to do a lot of testing and I needed to
        find a method so I could test and get good contrast. At that time people learned
        something called the zone system, but I didn\u2019t know what that meant.
        I never could get a print that I thought was decent that had good contrast.
        I couldn\u2019t get a full black and a real white white and everything in
        between. I had a lot of white and a lot of grey but not real black black.
        I was just sort of muddling around and I could see that I needed some real
        instruction in it and I couldn\u2019t get it at my school, so I gave up on
        the instruction part.\nI did continue with photography by photographing my
        work. Most artists have to do their own documentation whether you\u2019re
        a drawer or a painter\u2014you have to photograph your work for catalogs and
        applying for grants. When I got out of my undergraduate, or I guess even at
        Hamline, I was starting to learn on my own how to document my pots and drawings.
        I\u2019ve kept that up all these years through all the changes of equipment
        and switched over to digital. I\u2019m not quite up to speed with it. I used
        to teach at the college level how to photograph your work with film in a camera,
        but I could never teach digital documentation; I feel like I\u2019m way over
        my head. But I\u2019m getting better at it. I\u2019ve kept up that part of
        photographing and I do really enjoy photographing my work once I\u2019ve given
        myself over to it. I really like trying to frame it and capture the best view.
        I really like that as a problem. I really enjoy it. I have enjoyed teaching
        it, as well. I\u2019ve enjoyed passing that along to students because it\u2019s
        one of those things that, if you don\u2019t learn how to do it, it costs a
        lot of money to do. And you have to do it. You just have to do it to get your
        work out there and apply for grants and be in catalogs and exhibits. It\u2019s
        sort of a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n24\nskill
        that you can\u2019t avoid. Someone gave me the camera of my dreams a few years
        ago. It\u2019s a four by five format press camera. It\u2019s the kind of camera
        that someone like Margaret Bourke-White would have used, that made all those
        beautiful photographs in the Forties. It\u2019s got a bellows in the front
        and you put a little black hood on. The film is in a plate. It\u2019s like,
        Oh, you can hardly buy the film now and it would cost too much to use it but
        it\u2019s like, Oh, I have this beautiful camera now. It\u2019s hard.\n02:16:35\nAW:
        Have you used it with certain things?\nLC: Oh, I\u2019ve played with it. I\u2019ve
        set up things, but I haven\u2019t bought any film. But I\u2019ve gone through
        the motions. It\u2019s fun. It feels like a real thing like the difference
        between a real old phone, a heavy phone with a rotary dial versus a cell phone.
        There\u2019s something really physical about an old tool that works well.\nAW:
        So you were at Hamline when you took that pottery class that Mark Pharis taught.
        What happened after that class?\nLC: Yeah, he left right away. He was there
        just the one semester. The other thing that I felt lucky about\u2014one was
        to have Mark there and to have him working in the studio and then to have
        his buddies, his pals\u2014Wayne Branum is the one I remember most\u2014would
        come into the studio. He was a serious pottery student as well. How do you
        find your people in college? Who do you hang out with? I just hung out at
        the studio all the time and those became my people. I felt so lucky that that
        first pottery class\u2014so many of those people wanted to keep working at
        night and on the weekends. It was a really nice energy in the studio. I felt
        so lucky to have found a place where I really felt at home, even though I
        wasn\u2019t very good at it. I loved being there and was so happy there. The
        other thing, we had a certain kind of pottery wheel. We learned on these old
        Leach style treadle wheels. It\u2019s a sit down wheel and you kick with your
        foot. That\u2019s what we learned on and that\u2019s the kind of wheel I came
        around to settling on in my own work. That feels lucky to me that was my first
        real tool was that wheel. I feel so lucky that it is just the right tool for
        me. If you think about drawing\u2014if you draw, you pick a pencil that\u2019s
        really, really soft, or really, really hard, it could have a wide line, it
        could make a skinny line, but there\u2019s are all these variables. When I
        think about a pottery wheel, it allows me to get a certain kind of line with
        a certain kind of speed of a wheel with a certain kind of motion with my hands.
        It\u2019s like I found a way to make a line or mark on the material in a way
        that I connected with. It took a long time to figure that out but I feel lucky
        that I learned with a tool that I discovered it could make a line that I loved,
        which I found in hindsight is remarkable because I\u2019ve tried all sorts
        of tools and wheels and this and that and to end up using what I learned on,
        to come around to that, is lucky, amazingly lucky to me.\nAW: How did Mark
        teach ceramics? What were you learning in that class?\nLC: It\u2019s kind
        of hard to remember, actually. I was such a muddler and I know we had assignments
        and I don\u2019t think I did very well. I can\u2019t really remember too much
        about it. He was a harsh critic, and I remember feeling like I was way in
        over my head, but I don\u2019t know that I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n25\ncould come up with assignments or too many memories
        other than trying to learn how to center. I found that really hard. It seems
        like I would sort of learn something and go, Oh yeah, this is great. Then
        I would come the next day and feel like I had lost it, so it felt like I was
        starting all over. But I had a lot of teachers after that. Hamline had the
        adjunct professor thing so we had lots of different teachers. I had Bob Toensing,
        I think, was the next person. He went on to teach at Anoka Ramsey. Bob was
        there for most of my time. I don\u2019t remember much about the classes. I
        think you could only take two classes and then independent study, so most
        of my classes were independent study.\n02:21:50\nAW: When you were there observing
        Mark and his friends in the studio, what were you noticing about their approach
        to ceramics?\nLC: It\u2019s hard to conjure up\u2014I could see the wheel
        in the room and Mark hunched over\u2014I think it was all new to me and it
        was amazing to me. I just couldn\u2019t fathom how you could take that lump
        of stuff and then kick your leg a little bit and it would grow taller and
        wider. It was just sort of a magic trick that I could not do very well (laughs)
        and they could. The other thing that we did\u2014the students, we would get
        together and Mark and Wayne would hold a sale together of their work, like
        at somebody\u2019s house or somebody\u2019s studio. We\u2019d go to their
        sale and pick up lots of pots. The other thing lucky that happened\u2014this
        was just by happenstance really\u2014through the University of Minnesota,
        Mark met Betty Woodman, who is a major American ceramic figure. Actually,
        though, Wayne Branum\u2014I think Wayne met Betty and Mark met Betty through
        Wayne. Betty came and gave a demonstration at the University of Minnesota.
        Mark was at Hamline, so he took us over to the \u201cU\u201d to watch her
        demonstrate and that really blew me away. I just could not believe the way
        she could touch the clay. The clay, I remember, it was very, very soft and
        pliable. She would make pieces on the wheel and then cut them apart and lay
        them down on the table. It was a like a revolution to me that you weren\u2019t
        just making a little bowl or a round little thing\u2014you could actually
        treat it like fabric or wood or metal. You could construct something out of
        something that you had put a form to. Betty came to Hamline and gave, I think,
        the only artist lecture that I ever heard at Hamline. She was the only person
        that I ever watched someone give a slideshow of their own work. I never had
        one female teacher at Hamline, either, in the art department or any other
        department. I had not one. So Betty was the only person that I ever saw as
        an undergraduate in that kind of capacity. Today it is remarkable, really.
        I also think how lucky I was because I really had an emotional response\u2014I
        connected with her work. It was very remarkable. I had never seen anything
        like it. I wouldn\u2019t say that it helped me learn, but it was just seeing
        possibilities. I saw some possibilities and keep at it and see what happens
        kind of attitude\u2014kind of Pollyanna, really. I\u2019m kind of like Pollyanna:
        keep your chin up, you know.\n02:26:10\nAW: Seems like a good way to be.\nLC:
        Yeah, well the other thing that happened then too is that we would take some
        of our work over to the U. They had a salt kiln\u2014I can\u2019t remember
        who it was that got us students in there\u2014but we\u2019d take our work
        from Hamline over to the University of Minnesota. We would sneak it A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n26\ninto this kiln.
        I don\u2019t know how we snuck it over there; it seems kind of impossible
        that you could actually do that, but it felt like that. I\u2019m not sure
        if we snuck it or if it was a legitimate thing but we had a number of salt
        firings. That\u2019s where I first got a glimmer of a kind of surface that
        I loved\u2014a surface that I could put on my work. One of the things I struggled
        with besides the technical aspects of using your hands was, What kind of a
        surface would I put on my work? Most schools have sort of a standard palate
        of glazes that you use and they\u2019re all mixed up and you use them. I had
        done a lot of experimenting but I couldn\u2019t find anything that I really
        loved. I liked some of the qualities about the glazes we had, but I realized
        early on that I loved the clay by itself. It always felt like, by putting
        a glaze on, I was putting clothing on a body or something; it\u2019s like
        I wanted to see the skin, the bones and the structure. I liked a transparent
        glaze because you could still see that but one that you couldn\u2019t see
        through or a matte glaze or a crystalline glaze, it just felt like clothing,
        and I wanted to see the clay. I always had that sense\u2014I couldn\u2019t
        have verbalized it at that point\u2014but it just didn\u2019t feel right to
        me. It could feel right when it was still wet and full of life but it seemed
        to always go downhill after that and just get worse and worse. Out of the
        salt kiln, what people were trying to achieve, was what people call an orange
        peel. It\u2019s a surface sort of like a peel on an orange; it\u2019s sort
        of bumpy and a little fatty, kind of ripple-y. People were really after that.
        It did have an overall color or tone that was all the same. Everybody would
        want that and they were really after that, and I thought, Yeah, I should get
        that. I want that. But I never really felt like I liked it. The parts of the
        kiln that I ended up really loving were the parts that had been fired wrong\u2014it
        was irregular, it didn\u2019t get enough salt, and you\u2019d turn the pot
        around and one side would have the orange peel that you were supposed to get
        and the other side would be not much on it, and there would be a little flash
        from the salt or the flame. I thought, Aha, now this is really interesting
        because I can still see the clay. I can still see it. And it seemed to make
        it more visible. It kind of made it better. I thought, Ah, that must be the
        purpose of a glaze is to make the form better, according to what better means
        to you. Everybody has to figure out what that means. When I saw those flaws
        and connected on some kind of level, I thought, Wow, there is something here
        for me. I made note of that.\nWe moved our studio at Hamline across the road
        and I was one of the volunteers to help, and the teacher said, \u201cWe should
        build a salt kiln. Who will build it?\u201d I raised my hand and nobody else
        did, so I ended up building a little salt kiln and tried to figure out how
        to get that irregular surface. I did get it in some places. It was a nice
        school because students were encouraged to help build kilns and learn how
        to weld and cut bricks and do the pipefitting\u2014it was really good for
        me in that way\u2014mixing clay; we learned how to do all those skills. I
        became the technician, you know\u2014it\u2019s like your student job to mix
        the clay and the glazes. That was good. You must be tired of hearing this
        stuff. (Laughs)\n02:31:28\nAW: No, no, this is good, keep going. It\u2019s
        great this sense that you were trying something out in the salt kiln and then
        you get this piece back where you see, Oh, this can\u2014that was something
        that spoke to you from that, what do you call it, the flaw firing?\nLC: --Flaws,
        or faults.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n27\nAW:
        Yeah, but it actually was an inspiring moment for you. Was that something
        that you tried to recreate?\nLC: After that school I didn\u2019t know what
        to do and I ended up getting a scholarship to go to art school in Canada.
        We had a teacher there who came in the summer and we built a wood fire kiln.
        That kiln, it was kind of the same thing\u2014I discovered a surface from
        that kind of kiln that was a flaw that people weren\u2019t after. It was a
        different kind of flaw, but it was a similar kind of discovery. When I eventually
        got out on my own, I couldn\u2019t decide which of these directions to go
        with and I ended up going with both. That\u2019s what I use today, I employ
        both of those flaws, or faults.\nAW: What school in Canada were you in?\nLC:
        It\u2019s called the Banff Center School of Fine Arts.\nAW: When you graduated
        from Hamline, what were you thinking at that point?\nLC: Oh, I didn\u2019t
        know what to do. I was terrified. I had no idea what to do. I wanted to keep
        working in ceramics but I didn\u2019t know what to do. This school had a fifth
        year, which is basically you\u2019re the technician in the studio and you
        can work in the studio. They called it an apprenticeship program. So I signed
        up for that and no one else signed up, so I got it, which was great. I got
        a couple of part time jobs to pay my apartment and food and then I could work
        as much as I wanted and do the work for the teacher, professor, you know,
        get some critical feedback and try to not think about the next year. (Laughs)\nAW:
        When you graduated with an art major what was your parent\u2019s response?\nLC:
        They were worried. I remember my father said to me, \u201cYou should really
        get your teaching credentials so you can teach high school.\u201d I just said
        to him, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll never teach. I don\u2019t want to teach. I don\u2019t
        know what I\u2019ll do, but you\u2019ve always told me to follow my passion
        and that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Laughs) But, you know, they
        were concerned that I would have a hard time making a living, rightfully so,
        as any parent would be concerned.\nAW: When you were at Hamline you said you
        met a few professional artists, like Mark and his friends, did you ever talk
        to them about what it was like to make ceramics a career?\n02:35:15\nLC: Well,
        most of them that I did meet taught; most of them had an academic life. Most
        of them didn\u2019t have to make their livelihood from their work. I met mostly
        painters and people who drew, you know, through other classes. I didn\u2019t
        really meet all that many ceramic people, just Betty Woodman, Mark. No other
        teacher brought in any professional potter or ceramicist to give us a lecture
        or a slideshow. I don\u2019t think people did it as much as they do today.
        It was probably unusual; the whole visiting artist thing was probably not
        as widespread as it is now. I didn\u2019t think ahead too much, which I think
        was good, actually. (Laughs) I was thinking about what is the next thing.
        I didn\u2019t think too far down the line, but I did start worrying about
        the next year. I had seen A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n28\na
        poster for this school in Banff, Alberta, Canada. I had taken a summer school
        there. I had gotten a scholarship. So I knew about the school. I saw another
        poster and it had a line drawing of the mountain and it said, \u201cCeramic
        Scholarship, Two-Year Residency.\u201d I thought, Aha, this could be good.
        I was so lucky. I applied for that and I got a free ride. It was unbelievable.
        I had to get a little job to pay for a place to live and food but it was tuition
        free. It was a two-year program where you just worked, there was no instruction
        at all. Visiting artists would come and go. So that\u2019s where I met some
        visiting artists. I don\u2019t know that there were any women. There was one
        woman, Ann Mortimer, but it was mostly Canadian men, some American men, a
        couple of people from England, really interesting people. There were a couple
        of people who were really influential for me. There was a fellow named John
        Chalke who was a British potter who moved to Canada and he taught at the Alberta
        College of Art. He introduced me to a time period in ceramics that became
        really important to me, historically. Looking back at that time period I really
        connected with these pots and they were medieval pots from Portugal, Spain,
        France, England. That time period, it was the first group of historical pots
        that I had ever seen outside of a few pictures in a couple of books that I
        felt sort of a kinship with. It\u2019s like discovering a photograph of your
        great-great grandfather or something. It\u2019s like there\u2019s some kind
        of connection at some basic level that you really don\u2019t quite get what
        it is but there\u2019s something there. He introduced all of us to some films
        that were great to see, some historical films. One of them was this old guy
        Isaac Button who had been a country earthenware potter in England. He was
        the last potter at this little factory, and he dug his own clay and did everything
        by hand. That made a big impression on me. It was like, Wow, I think I could
        want to be a potter. It just looked like such hard work. It looked brutal
        in a way that I liked, like that creamery or that coke plant. It just seemed
        kind of romantic in a kind of hard fought way. It seemed really attractive
        to me. It was a historical film, so of course you could never do that, but
        I liked seeing that a lot. We saw some old films from the Leach pottery in
        England where several of my friends had gone to train. I think in hindsight
        if I had known about the Leach pottery I might have gone, I might have tried
        to have gotten on there, but I didn\u2019t know about it at that point. I
        didn\u2019t like to be told what to do. I didn\u2019t like something that
        had a real straight and narrow, right and wrong way of doing things. I had
        heard that there was a right way and wrong way, and I didn\u2019t like that,
        it was sort of like adopting a religion. I always fought that kind of authority,
        in general, but again, in hindsight, it would have been really good for me.
        And man, I would love somebody to tell me what to do now. Tell me what to
        do, please! (Laughs). And from a skill point, I would have loved to have gone
        and had somebody actually show me step a, b, c, d, e, f, g. I would love it
        if I had those kind of skills because I just bumbled. I never had a teacher
        that showed skills or taught skills in that way. I\u2018m not sure where I
        got that idea of fighting\u2014probably from those teachers I got that attitude
        that if you keep trying you\u2019ll find it, which is a very na\u00efve way
        of teaching. As a teacher I would never teach that way. I think maybe you
        can come to that after you\u2019ve learned some skills. It\u2019s the rare
        person who could become a folk artist or play jazz music without learning
        scales and how to play and get some instruction. Anyway, I would have benefited
        from some real training, I think, but I fought it too.\n02:42:25\nAW: During
        these two years of residency, how would you describe your work? What was your
        style?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n29\nLC:
        Well, I was just searching. All along I kept searching. It\u2019s hard to
        find your style when you have no real tradition behind you, you have nothing
        to break away from, don\u2019t know where you\u2019re at because you\u2019re
        all over the place. I was kind of all over the place. In these schools you\u2019re
        forced to use their materials and their glazes. I spent a lot of time experimenting
        to find things that felt like mine. It was like a quest, a quest to find out
        who I was in my work. It all seemed so intangible and faraway. The harder
        I tried to find it the further away it got. It just was very, very hard, even
        though my skills were getting better and I was reasonably competent at certain
        things. It seemed really difficult to figure it out. It seemed so intangible
        compared to my friends say who were photographers, or painters or printmakers,
        where they would go and look at something and try to capture it, or alter
        it, or combine elements to make something that was totally different, and
        it had some content that was definitely not a functional pot. It had another
        kind of content. So the intellectual stuff going along at the school didn\u2019t
        seem to have a lot to do with a cup and a bowl. I found it wonderful and very
        hard at the same time. It was bittersweet. I just kept trying things, I kept
        trying things. I think when I left I had developed a body of work that I could
        exhibit, and I got a grant. I could pass myself off as having a modest amount
        of skill and a cohesive body of work that had some continuity, but I didn\u2019t
        really feel all that great inside. I don\u2019t know, it just didn\u2019t
        feel great.\nAW: Didn\u2019t feel like you had found your clear voice with
        what you were making?\nLC: Yeah, some people use that word voice. I did find
        a certain voice, I did have a certain style. I was doing these big large landscape
        plates. I was in this mountain landscape, which was overwhelming, so I was
        basically doing these mountain landscapes on these big plates. There was a
        skill to learn how to make these big plates so they don\u2019t fall over and
        they don\u2019t crack, how to layer the glazes. I was sort of being a painter
        on a plate; I was painting plates, really. It just wasn\u2019t all that satisfying.
        With ceramics, the process is so long from making the form to glazing to firing
        and getting it out of the kiln. It\u2019s not like making a drawing or a quick
        painting; the turnaround time is so slow. My pace was glacial; my change felt
        glacial compared to my friends who were photographers. One day they\u2019re
        painting with oil, the next day they\u2019re making a drawing, and then they\u2019re
        making a photograph, printing on paper and folding it and stapling it. With
        ceramics, the tasks are so slow; you can\u2019t really be all over the place
        like that. I left there feeling like I still wanted to keep going, but I didn\u2019t
        feel like I really knew what I was doing. I didn\u2019t feel like I was connecting
        in a way with my work that felt genuine. If I had to use adjectives to describe
        it compared to the work I make now, it would probably be described as very
        controlled, very tight\u2014people have said it was Scandinavian in a way,
        rigid, calculated, cold. Now I would say my work is calculated, but the results
        probably wouldn\u2019t be described as cold. But it still is calculated in
        a certain way. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing. You
        probably wouldn\u2019t recognize it as my work. I wouldn\u2019t recognize
        it as my work I guess.\n02:48:44\nAW: Did you keep any of these?\nLC: I have
        a few things in the basement, yeah. I\u2019m kind of scared to look at it.
        (Laughs)\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n30\nAW:
        This is still the Banff Center School? Where did you head next? At that time
        did you participate in shows?\nLC: As a student, yeah, you were in shows,
        exhibitions. There were a couple of juried exhibitions and that was the first
        time I had tried to get my work in a juried exhibition and was successful
        and was surprised. That felt good; it felt surprising too. I was going to
        mention there were two other people that were helpful to me. This fellow John
        Chalke was the person who came during the summer and we built a two-chambered
        wood kiln. He was just a great person for me to meet at that time. He was
        just so full of curiosity. He was a perfect person for me to run into. There
        was another fellow John Reeve who had worked at the Leach pottery and was
        a good friend of Warren MacKenzie, who I eventually met and who was very helpful
        to me later on in my career. John Reeve had worked at the Leach pottery so
        through watching him work, he came as a visiting artist, and he talked a lot
        about the Leach pottery. It was at that point that I realized, Oh, wow, too
        bad I hadn\u2019t known about that. That was really wonderful. The director
        of the ceramic program, a guy named Les Manning, was very helpful to me as
        well. He taught me a few skills that I still use\u2014these specific skills,
        and teach them to other people and say I got it from him because they\u2019re
        so helpful and easy and I\u2019m ever grateful to him for that. It\u2019s
        a basic thing that everyone should learn that no one has shown you.\nAW: What
        are the skills?\nLC: How to make a slab, take a piece of clay and make a slab
        using nothing but a floor or a table. It has a thickness that\u2019s consistent
        through the whole length and width of it. You don\u2019t need a rolling pin
        or anything, just your hands. Hands, clay, and an absorbent surface. It\u2019s
        really strong and it\u2019s a beautiful technique.\nAW: Why is this important
        to learn?\nLC: It\u2019s sort of one of the skills that if you had to learn
        ten basic skills, how to make a slab would be one of them. You would eventually
        find that you would need to know how to do that. It\u2019s just such a simple
        thing. I guess it\u2019s like any other material like if you\u2019re going
        to be a woodworker, how do you take a pencil and a square and a handsaw and
        cut the end of a board off and it\u2019s square? Most people can\u2019t do
        that. Most people never have been shown how to do that. Most people now take
        it and put it an electric saw and cut it up.\nAW: Sounds like you met some
        more mentors and teachers there.\nLC: Yeah, lots of great people there. That
        was a really good place for me. Plus, I\u2019m a compulsive skier, so one
        of my goals there was to not ski, which was really good for me. But my little
        group of people that I was really tight with, we all loved to ski, so we had
        some great ski trips: skiing up the backside of glaciers, winter camping or
        staying in these alpine huts and skiing down, it was just my idea of heaven,
        climbing, oh, I love that kind of life.\nAW: Yeah, so many outdoors activities
        that you can do in an area like that, a really beautiful environment.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n31\nLC: I probably
        didn\u2019t mention that in between my college years I worked in the summers
        up in the Boundary Waters and in Ontario. My family, we were canoers growing
        up and campers, so I had those skills so I would do that in the summer. When
        I got out of Banff, when I was done there, I actually tried to emigrate to
        Canada because I liked it so much there, but I was unsuccessful. When I came
        back to Minnesota I didn\u2019t know where to live and I was thinking that
        what I would do is basically set up a base camp and in the summer I would
        run canoe trips and then in the winter I would work in the studio and my summer
        would support my winter. That was my thinking, which was actually ridiculous
        because there\u2019s no money in guiding canoe trips, sort of like potting\u2014it
        wasn\u2019t something that you would pick as a career if you wanted to make
        money. But I had that thought so that was what got me thinking about moving
        a log house. At that time I was by myself and found this cheap land and found
        a house to move. I kind of naively thought that I could get people to come
        up from the Twin Cities and basically camp here for a few days and I teach
        them basic skills that they needed to learn and then we\u2019d take a three
        week trip somewhere and then we\u2019d come back here and have a sauna and
        then they\u2019d go home and they\u2019d write me a big check. (Laughs)\n02:56:10\nAW:
        How did that work?\nLC: Well, once I got my land and the cabin here, I realized
        that I didn\u2019t want people here. I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted
        the quiet, and it just seemed like that would be a whole different career
        that had its own problems and fundraising issues and I couldn\u2019t do both.
        I had tried piano tuning too. I thought that would be a good way to support
        myself, but then I realized quickly that with piano tuning you were right
        or wrong and you had to do it everyday or you were wrong. I gave that up too.\nAW:
        So you got done with your degree in Canada, then you moved back to Minnesota.
        Why did you buy this land?\nLC: First I rented a house. I didn\u2019t know
        where to go. My mother was still alive in Wisconsin. I wanted to be sort of
        near her but not too far away. I drew a circle around the Twin Cities about
        an hour and I thought, I\u2019ll go north because it\u2019s closer to canoeing.
        I found a little house to rent and the people were very nice; they let me
        build a kiln. That was part of the deal. When I left school I had three thousand
        dollars. I was kind of enterprising: I taught community education and I had
        this full scholarship, and I was selling my work through the galleries, and
        we had student sales, too. So I had a little fistful of money to get going.
        So I did, I got going. I built a kiln, scavenged all my bricks, pretty much
        all free, I bought a little cheap wheel and got to work and I ran out of money
        by October.\nAW: When would you say you started?\nLC: It would have been July.
        Yeah, by October I was out of money. (Laughs)\nAW: What did you think then?\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n32\nLC:
        I was pretty upset, you know, as you would be. I didn\u2019t know what I was
        doing. I had put a little sign up by my driveway that said \u201cPottery,\u201d
        and I had a little box for money. A few people would stop out of curiosity.
        But the kiln was crummy and it didn\u2019t work very well. I was lonesome.
        I didn\u2019t know one person. I was so lonesome and I was living my dream,
        having my own studio, and kind of a recluse. It was really hard. But it was
        really good for me. I had to figure out how to connect with what I was making
        and I had to figure out how to make some friends. I felt like my education
        really began at that point, when I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy a
        postage stamp. It was really good for me. I found a wheel that was a Korean-style
        kick wheel and I had to kick it all the time\u2014you could never stop. I
        had mixed my clay on a big tarp on the ground with water and a hose and all
        that. The clay was so hard I could hardly get it to work on the wheel and
        it was so frustrating, and I was tearing my hair out; I couldn\u2019t figure
        it out, how to do this with this crappy wheel and this clay that was too hard.
        It was horrible. I would cry it was just so awful and I was lonesome and it
        was really awful. I was sitting there one day and I thought, Duh, make the
        clay softer, that might help. So I made the clay softer and I put it on the
        wheel\u2014and I couldn\u2019t work in my normal method\u2014at that point
        I was using an electric wheel at Banff because that\u2019s what they had,
        so my work was stiff and hard and machined and I couldn\u2019t do that with
        this little wheel. So I thought, Make the clay soft. I made the clay soft,
        and then suddenly it was like, Oh, I get it. I could relax and I could kick
        slow, work real slow. The wheel could barely spin around and I could still
        work with it. It was like, This could be good. It was like a door opened.
        Nobody showed it to me, it was just desperation. It was an amazing moment
        for me. Over time I realized, Gee, this wheel is great, and then I remembered
        the wheels I had learned on at school: the Leach treadle wheel. By that point
        I had met Jeff Oestreich and he had one of those wheels and he wanted another
        one, so we found a couple at the Edina Art Center. I bought one and then it
        was like, Aha, there\u2019s some hope. I have some hope. That was really where
        I felt like I was connecting with the material in a way that had a sense of
        life and curiosity\u2014not that I could do it very well, but I really felt
        a spark of something. Wow, this could be good, this could be good for me,
        not that the work could be good but that this could be good for me, trying
        in this method, with these restrictions, this could be good. This could lead
        somewhere. That really set me on to where I am today. It took having to reinvent
        everything I had learned\u2014it must be like going into the army or something,
        where they break you down and build you back up. But it was sort of like that.\n03:03:25\nAW:
        When you moved into the area you said you met Jeff Oestreich. Did you know
        any other potters? Did you have a sense that there were other potters around?\nLC:
        No, I didn\u2019t know anyone that lived around here at all.\nAW: When was
        this again, when you moved in?\nLC: Hmm, I don\u2019t know, 1977, maybe. Yeah,
        1977. When I ran out of money I worked at a ski area and there was another
        woman working there\u2014just the two of us\u2014and she was house-sitting
        for Jeff Oestreich. I had seen his sign but I didn\u2019t know who he was
        or what he did. I was so busy I didn\u2019t pay attention; I never went down
        there. We became friends working and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come
        for supper?\u201d I followed the sign and it was just a few miles away. It\u2019s
        ridiculous A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n33\nthat
        I didn\u2019t go down there. I remember I walked in the door and there was
        a little drawing on the wall that Bernard Leach had drawn for Jeff and it
        said, \u201cFrom Bernard to Jeff,\u201d and then here was a Michael Cardew
        pot, and I saw immediately that Jeff and I shared some sensibilities about
        pottery. It was like, Oh, wow, this could be my brother, or an uncle, he must
        be a relative of mine, an aesthetic ally. I picked up on that right away and
        so I could hardly wait to meet him. That was really wonderful, that was really
        delightful to discover him. Then there was another woman, another potter,
        Janel Jacobson, who lived near Sunrise. I didn\u2019t know anything about
        her. She had been trained in a different school, the Marguerite Wildenhain
        Bauhaus sensibility. I didn\u2019t really connect with that kind of aesthetic,
        but I really connected with Janel because she was doing what I wanted to do.
        I admired her very much. There were three of us really. We did quite a few
        things together early on. We made a little brochure together. That was the
        first marketing, maybe one of the only few marketing things I have ever done.
        Jeff and Janel and I had put out a flyer with a map on it and picture of us
        and we each wrote a little something. We put them at the tourist spots where
        the tourists would stop. That was our initial effort to do something collectively.
        I guess in a way you could think of that as a beginning of a tour, in a way.
        In a certain way it was a collective effort to help each other out, help each
        other out making our living independently, which is another commonality with
        the Tour [St. Croix Tour]\u2014each studio does their own thing in a way,
        but collectively we help each other. We each do what we want to do, need to
        do, by ourselves, but team up together as a group. I don\u2019t know what
        year that would be, probably 1978 or 1979 maybe?\nSo I ran out of money and
        basically was homeless for a little while. I found a house to housesit, which
        is what people do when you don\u2019t have a home. I found a free place to
        live and I asked Jeff if I could work at his studio for the winter. I did
        that along with a fellow Hamline friend named Mark Baden, who taught ceramics
        for years at Northwestern (University).This friend of mine Mark Baden.\nAW:
        When was he there?\nLC: At Northwestern? I think he just retired maybe five
        years ago. He was there from 1980 to 2010, or so. He was there for a long
        time. The three of us worked together for one winter, which was really nice,
        an incredible time.\nAW: What was so nice about it?\nLC: Oh, we were just
        so excited about making pots and just worked really hard and we were all younger
        and excited. Jeff was always remodeling something, his studio or his house
        or something, and Mark and I would pitch in and we helped quite a bit on the
        studio. You know, starting to get invited to be in shows and things like that.
        It was fun. None of us had much money but we were doing what we wanted; we
        were young and it was fun. It was fun to have an ally that you could borrow
        materials from, or if something was really troubling you could hash it out
        and try to figure it out what was going on, if something\u2019s wrong with
        the clay or the glaze. It was nice to not be alone, not feel so alone. Maybe
        I worked for five years doing odd jobs and then I could finally support myself.
        I worked at that ski area, I made snow and did some welding, and worked on
        the chair lift. I worked in a fire tower. I always picked kind of seasonal,
        high-pay, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n34\noutdoor
        kind of jobs where I could be outside. Worked as a fire fighter for the DNR.
        Those kinds of jobs.\n03:10:52\nAW: Did those jobs have any kind of influence
        on your ceramics, if you\u2019re outside and in these environments?\nLC: I
        don\u2019t think so. I saw being in the studio as my job and then I saw my
        job as my hobby. I looked at it that way. Often times I would go to work really
        tired. But firefighting and working at the ski area, those were really physically
        demanding. That was really good because you\u2019d be really tired, that was
        really good. I liked that. I like physical work. That was really good for
        me and paid pretty well. It was seasonal so you knew it would end, which was
        important to me. I wanted to just work for a few months and then get out of
        there. I wanted to work hard, make as much money as I could, and then get
        out of there. The fire tower was probably one of the best jobs because it
        was so beautiful. It was a beautiful job and it was so visual, I really enjoyed
        that. I always picked these jobs where you needed some kind of observational
        skill. I didn\u2019t mention this, but in high school I was a lifeguard. As
        a lifeguard you\u2019re not looking for who\u2019s drowning, you\u2019re being
        spaced out, really, just getting the general look of everything. You\u2019re
        trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s out of order, which is
        a real visual job. The fire tower was like that too. You\u2019re just watching,
        scanning, you\u2019re just slowly turn in a circle all day long, you just
        keep turning in a circle, kind of spaced out thinking about whatever it its
        you want to think about but you\u2019re looking at stuff but, not focusing
        too hard on too many things. That allows you to see what\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s
        different. I always like those jobs where you can employ those visual skills.
        The fire tower job was really nice for that because I could watch birds and
        animals and that was great to just sit and watch nature from high above. The
        animals didn\u2019t know you were watching them. I saw deer playing tag; just
        like kids, they play tag, \u201cYou\u2019re it.\u201d They nudge one and then
        they all run around and try to avoid the one that was it. Just like we do.
        That was great; that was fantastic to watch that.\nAW: I remember something
        you said earlier about, I think, looking for what is the problem, and wanting
        to solve the problem. I think you described it in an initial interest in drawing
        but in pottery too. Is there a pattern here?\nLC: It is a pattern. I see it
        as a pattern. There is a material that has a certain characteristic or order
        to it and what\u2019s interesting is what is out of order. How do you develop
        a vocabulary with the material and give it a different order that has some
        interest to you, whatever that is? A tension or balanced beauty or whatever
        your idea of compelling interest is. For somebody who is visually based or
        who greets the world with vision, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about\u2014it\u2019s
        about order and disorder and regularity\/irregularity, and then finding a
        material to work with that is of some interest to you. I think that\u2019s
        what visual people do. I don\u2019t really know this, but it\u2019s what I
        think. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say this, but that\u2019s probably what
        I would have to say about it.\n03:16:00\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n35\nAW: How does that translate into pottery, that
        kind of problem-solving? Sorry, maybe you\u2019ve already defined this clearly?\nLC:
        I guess if you relate pottery and music, maybe that would be an analogy that
        you could understand. Musicians, or people concerned with music\u2014this
        is maybe minimalizing it\u2014you\u2019re either a composer or an interpreter,
        a performer: somebody who likes to invent or somebody who likes to work with
        theme and variation. There\u2019s classics or standards, if you talk about
        the form of music and I think with pottery\u2014I think we\u2019re closest
        to music than other art forms, maybe architecture too\u2014but with pottery
        we have our standard forms: plates, cups, baking things, serving things\u2014they\u2019re
        standards, they\u2019re classic forms. There\u2019s kind of nothing new in
        a way. If you look at thousands and thousands and thousands of years there\u2019s
        not a lot that\u2019s too new. Technology changes but the problem or the opportunity
        or the form doesn\u2019t change all that much. If you see it that way, we\u2019re
        more like interpreters than composers. Talk about the problem\u2014what\u2019s
        the problem? The problem is a form. It\u2019s a limited problem. It\u2019s
        got a lot of restrictions to it: to make a cup that feels good in your hand,
        or makes you want to set it down and look at it, holds the heat, doesn\u2019t
        hold the heat, holds the ice, sounds good with the ice, is rounded, is straight-walled.
        What\u2019s it going to hold? How is it going to feel on your lip? Does it
        have a handle? Does it need a handle? There\u2019s so many variations just
        in that word, \u201ccup,\u201d there\u2019s an infinite number of possibilities.
        It\u2019s a very narrow, narrow, narrow area of interest if you think about
        the whole spectrum of ceramics or visual arts\u2014there\u2019s 360 degrees
        of possibilities but we\u2019re working with\u2014I don\u2019t know what degree,
        maybe only 10\u2014but within that little area there\u2019s an infinite number
        of possibilities. I see it like that\u2014it\u2019s limited but there\u2019s
        as much room as you can make in that limited little area. I don\u2019t think
        it\u2019s that different than, say, being a writer or being a musician\u2014a
        lot of other forms there\u2019s limitations and then there\u2019s your material,
        skills, what\u2019s compelling to you that\u2019s a problem\/opportunity,
        form, whatever you want to call that. I can\u2019t remember what your question
        was?\nAW: That helps, I thought it would be helpful to have some more explanation.
        You started to talk about activities with Jeff and Janel. What else was going
        on at that time in the St. Croix River Valley? You did some shows together?\nLC:
        Yeah, but not around here. We all individually had our own sales at our own
        studios. Janel was going to the Renaissance Festival. I think that had just
        started. There were a few art fairs around. In our area there were two. The
        Minnesota Arts Council had an art fair at St. Kate\u2019s. Then there was
        one at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts called the Rose Fete. I think that
        was the name. Jeff and I did those, and I don\u2019t think that either one
        of us did well\u2014it wasn\u2019t productive, I would put it that way. I
        only did a few art fairs in my life, maybe three\u2014I think I did one more
        and I found myself between a taxidermist and somebody that made ceramic license
        plates for your bicycle that were personalized, like it would say Debbie or
        something made out of clay, and you would hang it on your bike. I just felt
        that I didn\u2019t fit in between the taxidermist and that, so I think I just
        packed up and left and that was it. I thought I\u2019d never ever do that
        again. There were a few galleries that were interested. Jeff and I had some
        work at Groveland Gallery, which is still going, right behind the Walker.
        They have mostly drawings and prints, and they had drawings and prints then,
        and ceramics. There was one cooperative gallery and I don\u2019t remember
        much about it. I think it was down by Macalester on Grand Avenue called\u2014can\u2019t
        remember the name of it. There was this Minnesota Crafts Council. That was
        sort of the only thing going in A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL.
        Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n36\nterms of a community that I was aware of. Jeff
        and I were involved with that. I think we took care of the mailing list. This
        was before computers and everything, and we did it by hand. Then it moved
        to a punch card kind of system.\n03:23:00\nLC: For some reason I was invited,
        along with Jeff\u2014Jeff knew Warren MacKenzie\u2014and for some reason,
        I met Warren through\u2014I\u2019m not even sure how. I guess I was invited
        to be part of his annual fall sale. He invited his former students and a few
        others. I was sort of the adopted child, which was pretty amazing to me. I
        had never met Warren and I didn\u2019t know much about him, really, at that
        point which seems odd to say. I don\u2019t think I had ever seen a pot of
        his until after I had moved here. Mark was one of Warren\u2019s students.
        I guess maybe I had heard his name, but I wouldn\u2019t have met him, I don\u2019t
        think. I might have met him when I went to see Betty Woodman, but I probably
        wouldn\u2019t have known who he was. That\u2019s neither here or there. For
        some reason I was lucky enough to be invited to be part of that annual sale,
        and Warren has been so supportive and really generous in helping me in so
        many ways over the years\u2014lots of sales. A few of us he invited to leave
        our work after the sale at his studio and then he would sell it and give us
        a check, which was incredible. It was like a little gallery. He took no commission\u2014unbelievable.
        We would try and do little things for him. He never wanted thanks, so we would
        try and do some little favor for him and not let him know because he wouldn\u2019t
        want to be thanked; that sort of person, so generous. That was really lucky,
        very helpful.\nWe talked about Bruce White earlier; his mother Helen White
        was a historian. She was really helpful to all of us potters, Jeff, Janel
        and I. Helen restored a number of old buildings in Taylor\u2019s Falls and
        wrote many, many history books published by the Minnesota Historical Society.
        She turned one of these historic buildings into a bed and breakfast. She bought
        pots from us and put it in the bed and breakfast. She really thought that
        people would stay at the bed and breakfast, see the pots, and they would flock
        to us and buy our work. She was so great\u2014I don\u2019t think that anyone
        ever came from that. She bought our work and donated it to the Minnesota Historical
        Society. I wish I could change it out now and give them something better.
        She was very helpful to us in many ways, and was a role model for me for sure
        and I\u2019m sure for Jeff as well because she was a serious writer, a serious
        historian, and found a way to live in a little town and make a living. She
        had this two-prong history life\u2014one serious historical books, and then
        this little newspaper called the Dalles Visitor, which was to bring history
        to the masses with photographs and real articles. She was really something:
        she spoke her mind and she was a preservationist and she was run out of town
        on a rail by the city council because she confronted them when they burned
        down a house that was on the National Historic Registry. They swore at her
        and called her every name in the book\u2014at a city council meeting\u2014and
        she left. Many years later she bought a house in town and she came back. She
        painted it the color of this house that burned down and they made her the
        queen of the parade. They reconciled and it was amazing, the story of Helen
        White. Someone could write a book about her and her life, a very interesting
        woman. She was really important to us three initial potters. She was a force
        for us, she was an ally, working in a different field but definitely a force.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nL. Christianson\n06\/17\/14\n37\nAW:
        What was your sense of the history of this area when you moved in? Did she
        help you engage in this place through history that you might have learned
        through her? Or more so she was a supporter of your work and ceramics? What
        was it about her that helped you?\nLC: I think writers are sort of like artists
        in that basically writers shut themselves up in a room and they\u2019re quiet
        and they work with words. I think it\u2019s sort of what we potters do; it\u2019s
        not words but it\u2019s a different material, but I think that process is
        very much the same in that way, in that solitary way with your material, quiet.

        Why don\u2019t we get started? First if you could tell us about when and where
        you were born?\nGC: I was born in Venezuela in 1951 in a city called Maracaibo,
        which is on the border with Colombia; it\u2019s in western Venezuela.\nAW:
        And how do you spell that? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n2\nGC:
        M-a-r-a-c-a-i-b-o. And it\u2019s where the center of the oil industry was
        located when it first started in the 1920s.\n[AUDIO NOTE: Sound of bird clock.]\nAW:
        Is your family from that region?\nGC: No, not at all. My father is Colombian,
        or was Colombian, and my mother was born in Chile. Her grandparents were immigrants
        from the United Kingdom.\nAW: And why did they come over from the UK?\nGC:
        I\u2019m not really sure, but my mom\u2019s dad worked with the mining industry
        in Chile, and then early on, when my mom was about 7 or so, they moved to
        Peru, where he continued to work up in the high Andes in copper mining. The
        mining industry is so volatile that it\u2019s boom and bust, so the jobs end
        in one place and start in another, so she ended up being raised in Peru. My
        father eventually went to an agronomy school in Lima and met my mom, and they
        married, and my dad actually got a job with a man\u2014Nelson Rockefeller
        had many interests in Venezuela, and one of them was this production of milk,
        so there was a milk-processing plant in Maracaibo and my father got a job
        working there.\nAW: And what were your parents\u2019 names?\nGC: Alipio Cuellar
        is my dad, and A\u00efda is my mom.\nAW: Are they still living?\nGC: My dad
        died in 1999, and my mom\u2019s still with us. She lives in Lima right now.
        Lima, Peru.\n[Update: A\u00efda passed away on October 12, 2014]\nAW: Did
        she go to college, as well?\nGC: She did, she did. Many small world stories,
        but one is that she was a foreign exchange student\u2014she and her sister
        managed to get some financing to go to a small college in Iowa called Cornell
        College, and she was there for a year, as a foreign exchange student. I ended
        up going to that same school, and that\u2019s where I first started making
        pots in 1970. My wife Laurie was also a freshman that same year, so we started
        Cornell at the same time. And Laurie\u2019s grandfather had been dean of the
        college, and he had been the person that had been in charge of taking care
        of my mom and her sister when they went to school at that school.\nAW: Why
        did you pick Cornell?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n3\nGC:
        Well, my dad was very much interested in having this business and having it
        grow, and he wanted me to train to become a business manager or to study chemical
        engineering and get a masters degree in business or something like that so
        that I could work with him in all of his projects and plans. That didn\u2019t
        work out so well, but they sent me to the U.S.\u2014and I went to international
        schools, or English-speaking schools, in Venezuela, so I learned English when
        I was very young. They sent me to school in the States so that I could, you
        know, study all of these things. My dad actually had gone to school in the
        States, too, and he got a master\u2019s in animal husbandry in the University
        of Illinois. So they were both big fans of the Midwest\u2014they loved the
        Midwest of the United States. They thought that it just had all the right
        values. They really identified with that.\n00:05:20\nGC: They sent me to some
        high schools in the U.S. for four years of high school, as well. And I was
        alone, I was a high school student, I didn\u2019t have a lot of supervision\u2014I
        was having a wonderful time, but I wasn\u2019t getting a whole lot of work
        done. So it was basically this is your choice: you can either go to college
        at Cornell, or we won\u2019t fund your college education. At that time I was
        going to school in Massachusetts. It was the late \u201960s. There was all
        kinds of stuff going on: the Vietnam War, there were protests, the moratorium,
        and I was involved in all of that stuff because that\u2019s what the times
        were about. So they were trying to take me out of that area and put me in
        a place that they thought was going to be very good as far as values. I wanted
        to go to college, but I was very much thinking that this was going to be a
        real drag to be in Iowa\u2014that it was going to be a cultural desert\u2014and
        it didn\u2019t turn out to be that way at all. I really actually loved Iowa.
        It was just a really wonderful experience going to school there.\nAW: What
        was it about it that you loved?\nGC: I loved the people. And it was a small
        school. There was a ceramics teacher\u2014Doug Hanson. It was his first year
        as a teacher. He had graduated from the University of Iowa in Iowa City, and
        he had some really good teachers there: Chuck Hines, Bunny McBride. It was
        his first year teaching\u2014he\u2019s always been an incredibly good and
        patient teacher and tolerant and encouraging. And I was so excited about pottery
        that I was in the studio all the time, I was always doing something, I was
        always making him do more work than he needed to do. And he was just really
        happy with that. He was excited to have someone that was excited about clay.
        So that whole experience really contributed to that general feeling. But,
        you know, just the people in Iowa were wonderful\u2014the teachers in general\u2014the
        school was great.\nAW: Had you had experience with pottery before?\nGC: No.
        It was just fulfilling a humanities requirement for the liberal arts degree.
        I had to take some art classes, so I took drawing and then ceramics.\nAW:
        And what year was that?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n4\nGC:
        Nineteen seventy was my first year of college.\nAW: Okay, so it was during
        your first year.\nGC: Yeah.\nAW: What did you think in that class? What were
        your first impressions of working with clay? Can you tell us more about those
        first experiences?\nGC: I ran into this book by Bernard Leach, which is The
        Potter\u2019s Book. It must have launched the careers of any number of potters,
        but I was one of them. I was just absolutely taken by his efforts to define
        what constitutes a good pot. Of course, that was his opinion, but he had many
        interesting arguments. Just the concept of making pots for use\u2014functional
        pots\u2014I guess at that time was extremely important to me, and it sort
        of did also fit in with the times of, you know\u2014there are a lot of trite
        phrases like going back to the land, and everything being natural, and all
        of this stuff\u2014but it really did appeal to me. I think it\u2019s really
        still pretty central to why I make pots is that sense that I\u2019m doing
        something that in some way is constructive. That the pots have a positive
        function in people\u2019s lives. That they encourage people to do things that
        are good in many different ways. I mean taking time to prepare good food,
        taking time to sit around a table with family or friends, generating community.
        The aesthetics\u2014the art part of making pots\u2014was critical to me, but
        also the fact that the pots were providing a service. Yeah, that\u2019s still
        really central to me.\n00:10:54\nAW: Did you take more pottery classes during
        your time at Cornell?\nGC: Yeah, I pretty much took a class every semester
        for the first two years, and then my parents realized that I was spending
        all of my time in the studio making pots, and so my funding dried up. So I
        was out of school for two years, and during that time, I had a couple of really,
        really important experiences. A friend and I drove from Venezuela to Chile.
        And I probably spent six months in that adventure, going to all of these different
        countries and really being impressed with how different the cultures were
        in each one of these supposedly similar countries\u2014they all spoke Spanish\u2014but
        it was really an amazing experience. Chile was in the middle of the last few
        weeks of Allende\u2019s regime, so we had a hard time getting out of Chile.
        That whole political experience was incredible. And in Bolivia, we spent all
        of our time with people that were involved in the music scene\u2014with the
        Andean music, which at the time was just beginning to become really important.
        I don\u2019t know if Paul Simon had already written\u2014or \u201cwritten,\u201d
        sort of taken over\u2014that \u201cEl Condor Pasa.\u201d But it was beginning
        to be recognized in the world, and we were there at time when there were all
        of these places where groups got together to play, and every night it would
        be different music\u2014just a fantastic cultural experience. Peru, I have
        a lot of family in Peru, so there was a huge family kind of thing going on
        in Peru. So yeah, every country was great\u2014was really, really interesting.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n5\nThen when
        I got back to Venezuela, I got a job for the person that I sold the\u2014of
        course it was a VW\u2014bus. We sold the VW bus to this gentleman who had
        a project to do an aerial geophysical survey of the Venezuelan Amazon. He
        was working with these old RAF pilots from the Second World War, and South
        African mercenaries, and people like that, and technicians in a DC-3 and flying
        over the Venezuelan Amazon, but none of them spoke any Spanish, so they needed
        somebody to kind of arrange everything\u2014a fixer. So that was my job with
        them for a while during those couple of years, and that was fantastic experience:
        to be able to get to wild places, really incredible places. (Chuckling) And
        these guys were informal, to say the least, so if we were flying along and
        we spotted a runway and a little stream, they might just land and go fishing
        for a little while, and then we\u2019d continue flying. (Laughs)\nAW: (Laughs)
        They must not have been on a tight research timeframe.\nGC: Yeah, no. No.
        But that was an incredible experience, as well. The kind of people that lived
        in the Amazon at the time\u2014there was this Hungarian that ran the restaurant
        that we normally ate at; there were all the missionaries; there were the Indians;
        there was the National Guard. The interactions between all of those people
        were just a fantastic cultural experience for me.\nBut time went on, and I
        eventually got back to Caracas, and I landed at my parents\u2019 house again.
        And they had kind of painted themselves into the corner that they weren\u2019t
        going to help me if I was going to make pots, and I wasn\u2019t going to do
        anything other than making pots, so eventually, I managed to get some scholarship
        help, and the school gave me some help, and I managed to get back to Cornell
        and finish. The government was handing out this scholarship money at the time,
        so my last year there I had a scholarship to do a geology major because you
        had to do something that was within the requirements. So I said, \u201cOkay,
        I\u2019ll get a geology major.\u201d I majored in geology, and I also majored
        in art. I had been taking French classes also\u2014the foreign student adviser,
        a guy called Harvey Stein, who was just this wonderful, wonderful man, he
        said, \u201cWell you know, if you take one or two more classes, you can get
        a French major, too.\u201d So I got a French major, which essentially is getting
        a lot of majors and not really knowing anything about any one of them. Then
        when I graduated in 1976, Laurie and I got married. Laurie and I had met first
        year in school. She graduated in \u201974 and went to work. She went to Chicago
        and did social work and stuff and then came back to Melbourne [sic; corrected
        by GC to Iowa]. Then when I graduated, we got married, and we went back to
        Venezuela on vacation. And we stayed there for thirty years.\n00:16:40\nAW:
        How did that happen?\nGC: Well, it was very nice there. It was a wonderful
        time. Venezuela was going through a real boom. You remember\u2014of course,
        you wouldn\u2019t remember. Speed limits in the U.S. were 55, Jimmy Carter
        was president. There was this oil crisis that the U.S. had; for Venezuela,
        was the oil boom. Money was just raining down from the sky. Many, many people
        from all over the world living in Venezuela, working. It was just full of
        all kinds of interesting people, parties, and A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n6\nwe did all kinds of stuff: trekking,
        diving. I got a job as a project manager for the World Wildlife Fund\u2014a
        Venezuelan affiliate called Fudena. That was three years, and I got an opportunity
        to travel around the country. A lot of our research was in remote areas with
        endangered species, trying to find out if there were any crocodiles, where
        they were, manatees, some birds\u2014a red siskin, which was an endangered
        bird. So I got into contact with a lot of the natives, the indigenous people
        of the country, and came into contact with a lot of their handwork. I have
        a lot of it lying around, but mostly baskets, a lot of fiber work, some pots\u2014well,
        hammocks, dugout canoes\u2014even their houses were all these wonderful handmade
        things. I just was really fascinated with the way they related to their handwork
        and to art in their lives\u2014how art was just always present in their lives.
        That was a big impression, and I guess you would say an influence of some
        sort\u2014even though it wasn\u2019t a direct influence. But their relationship
        with their work again reinforced that idea of having your work be somehow
        a service to the people around you, to the families, to the community. That
        was one of the really nice things about that job was being involved with that.\nThen,
        eventually, while I was working there, there\u2019s an English-language Venezuelan
        newspaper called The Daily Journal\u2014three of the most important potters
        that I had really admired through Leach\u2019s book and from a distance\u2014I\u2019d
        never met them\u2014they died, and there were articles about them in this
        newspaper. And I thought, \u201cWho else in this country would even know who
        these people were?\u201d I mean, they were famous potters but in general pretty
        obscure people. So when Leach died, and then Hamada died, I thought, You know,
        I\u2019m missing the boat. I really want to become a part of that historical
        sweep of pottery-making. I wanted to have the opportunity to see how these
        people worked and what things were important to them. So I decided to try
        to start making pots, and I was failing miserably, and having a horrible time.
        I went out and talked to some people, and I found that Warren MacKenzie was
        coming to Venezuela to teach a workshop. And of course, the workshop was full,
        and I had to find a way to get into it. I made friends with the president
        of the organization, and I told her that whatever they wanted me to do, you
        know, I could interpret, I could help build a kiln\u2014I had already done
        that, so I basically told them that they couldn\u2019t run the workshop without
        me and they fell for it. So I met Warren there, we made friends, it was an
        incredible experience; I\u2019d never seen anyone work with clay the way he
        did. Warren had been an apprentice at a production pottery\u2014I guess you
        would call it a production pottery\u2014and he could move the clay with an
        ease and a casual\u2014just, it was fantastic. People would ask him why he
        didn\u2019t bother to center the clay. You know, he was centering the clay
        so easily that people didn\u2019t even notice that he was centering before
        he started to throw. So that was an incredible experience, and I said, \u201cThis
        is the dude. This is the guy who\u2019s gonna be a window into that history
        of pots,\u201d that I so much wanted to connect with. And I told him that,
        and he must have had any number of people trying to get him to take them on
        as apprentices or teach them or whatever, and he said, \u201cYeah. But I can
        only teach you one kind of pots to make.\u201d I said, \u201cThose are the
        pots that I\u2019m interested in.\u201d It must have made some impression
        because a few years later, he wrote to us, and he invited Laurie and me to
        come up to his house and make pots with him for a month and have a sale. He
        also invited a woman called Clary Illian, who was also a Leach apprentice.
        She had been in Iowa, and actually she had been close to Cornell College,
        and I had gone to her studio and asked her if she would take me on as an apprentice.
        But she was involved with nurturing women artists, and she wanted to focus
        on that, so that hadn\u2019t A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n7\nworked
        out, but it was great to reconnect with her. And there was another Minnesota
        artist, Christie Wert, who was there.\nSo there were the five of us making
        pots, and then we had a pottery sale. That experience, as much as making the
        pots and seeing how the showroom worked, how the studio worked, you know,
        how the process went from materials, mixing clay, glazes, doing all the bisquing,
        glazing, and everything, and doing the firing\u2014I\u2019d never been in
        a studio that had it together, that was doing a good job making pots. So that
        was great, but the experience of getting a group of potters together and having
        a sale was really wonderful. It was incredible: just that community effort
        towards a mutual benefit of the group\u2014that was really cool. I was really
        excited about that. And I eventually went back to Venezuela, and a couple
        of years passed, and I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to do that here?\u201d
        So I called a few of my friends. Initially there were ten potters and two
        jewelers, and we had a sale at my place. We lived outside of the city\u2014about
        30 miles outside of Caracas in an old coffee-growing area\u2014it was a very
        beautiful place, beautiful views, very hard to get to\u2014a long, windy little
        road to get out there\u2014and so we thought, Well, we\u2019ll have a sale.
        My original thought was, We\u2019ll have a sale at my place, then we\u2019ll
        have a sale at his place, and then we\u2019ll have a sale at her place, and
        that way we\u2019re going to let the public know that all of these people
        in all of these places are making and selling handwork: pots or whatever.
        But the way it turned out, our first sale we were certain that nobody was
        going to come because you have to build it up and, you know. Well, we had
        so many people come out that we couldn\u2019t keep up. It was overwhelming.
        Everybody was walking around with a huge grin on their faces, and we had lines
        of people at the checkout. We made a lot of food and gave people food because
        there was no place to get any food out there\u2014it was out in the middle
        of nowhere in the country. I think the public was really surprised at the
        fact that people came out there and that they could eat and have coffee and,
        you know, just have a nice time as well as buy the pots. That sale became
        a really popular and\u2014it was kind of on the horizon nationally as a ceramic
        event or as an art, or as a cultural event. It must have been a real slow
        news day, but we actually even one time were on the front page of a national
        newspaper. It wasn\u2019t the headline, but it was on the\u2014Here in the
        States it would be almost unbelievable to have that happen. However, last
        year we had a full page in the Pioneer Press, color pictures and stuff\u2014there
        must be one around here, Laurie will know where it is. So, referring back
        to the St. Croix Valley Tour, it is really important, I think, here in the
        state of Minnesota; it\u2019s got a really big presence.\nSo this went on
        for many years in Venezuela. We had two sales a year, one in May, one in November,
        always sold out, had people come out. It was a beautiful natural situation.
        We were out in the forest, sloths would be walking by in the trees, and people\u2014Caracas
        is a big city, and it\u2019s a very city kind of city\u2014so to them, I think,
        it was amazing that they could go thirty miles out of town and kind of travel
        back in time a hundred years. All of that was really wonderful.\nI\u2019m
        not sure where to go from here. Am I going on way too long?\n00:28:25\nAW:
        You are doing great. Sometimes all it takes is one question, and\u2014 A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n8\nGC: \u2014And you\u2019ve
        got the whole interview. (Laughs)\nAW: Actually, there are a number of questions
        I\u2019d like to follow up on a little bit. Just to finish your flow, I think
        you were getting to how you came to Minnesota.\nGC: Yeah.\nAW: You were talking
        about hosting this tour in Venezuela after having studied with Warren MacKenzie\u2014\nGC:
        \u2014Been exposed\u2014I never studied with Warren. I\u2019ve never been
        his student, or I\u2019ve never really actually even taken a workshop with
        him. I\u2019ve been an assistant at his workshops, a couple of them\u2014but
        if you ask him, he would say I\u2019ve never been his student. That, for some
        reason, is important to him. So I (chuckling) I want to keep that clear.\nAfter
        being exposed to his studio and that pottery sale, yeah, we took that experience
        and really made it into something really special in Venezuela. It was really
        amazing.\nAW: What was it called?\nGC: It was called Encuentro\u2014El Encuentro\u2014and
        the town where we lived was Turgua: T-u-r-g-u-a.\nAW: And how do you spell
        the name of the event?\nGC: Encuentro is \u201cencounter\u201d in Spanish,
        and it\u2019s not exactly the same meaning, but it\u2019s something like that.
        Encuentro is getting together, gathering, maybe a celebration\u2014it was
        kind of a situation where people would meet that hadn\u2019t seen each other
        for years and years, and they\u2019d meet there, and you\u2019d see all these
        people having a really nice social situation.\nAW: And when was the first
        year you started that?\nGC: Nineteen ninety-two. Then it went on for thirteen
        years. We did about twenty-six or twenty-seven of them. There was a year where
        we tried to do a couple more, but that was not a good idea. It was too much
        to ask people to come out three times in a year.\n00:30:48\nAW: So you did
        May and November, pretty much?\nGC: Yeah. Mother\u2019s Day\u2014actually
        we did it the weekend before Mother\u2019s Day so people would have a chance
        to come out and get a present before Mother\u2019s Day. In November, it was
        the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n9\nweekend
        before Thanksgiving because there were a lot of foreigners who came, and they
        were always off on vacation. Laurie?\nLM: Yeah?\nGC: If you go upstairs and
        come back down, could you bring one of those Turgua books?\nLM: Sure.\nGC:
        Then the social and political situation in Venezuela started to change, and
        became less attractive to live there. Mostly crime became really rampant\u2014just
        kind of insecurity, people breaking in all the time. Everyone that you knew
        had had his car stolen at least once. I think over my lifetime there I had
        four cars stolen. Well, the pickup that I bought\u2014Laurie?\u2014lasted
        six weeks?\nLM: Yeah.\nGC: It had 900 kilometers on it\u2014\nLM: \u2014Yeah\u2014
        Don\u2019t tell me, I don\u2019t want to hear about this.\nGC: You don\u2019t
        want to relive all that?\nLM: No.\nGC: The last one that was stolen was this
        car that we had set up for carrying our kayaks on the roof, and we were taking
        people and doing trips. When I saw that car drive out and I chased them down
        the block about four blocks, I figured, I don\u2019t want to buy another car.
        That was kind of like the [last] straw. And it was kind of hard to get raw
        materials to make pots anymore. The dollar had become\u2014there was no convertibility
        of the Venezuelan currency. So you couldn\u2019t go out with bol\u00edvares
        and buy dollars. That was supposed to be illegal, although everyone did it,
        because the official exchange rate was, say, three, and the black market exchange
        rate would be thirteen or something like that. It was such a spread. So, the
        economy went downhill, and mainly we just felt that we couldn\u2019t make
        a living making pots there anymore. And our kids graduated from high school;
        they were going to go to college in the U.S. Laurie was a teacher all that
        time at an international school\u2014one of the schools that I had gone to
        as a kid. Our kids went to school there.\nAW: What school was that?\nGC: It
        was called, E.C.A.\u2014Escuela campo alegre.\nAW: Can you spell the last
        word?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n10\nGC:
        A-l-e-g-r-e.\nAW: Was that a high school?\nGC: It was a high school. Elementary
        and high school, yeah.\nAW: Was that also in the same town where you were?\nGC:
        In Caracas. It was not in the town where we were. We lived outside of town
        for a long time, and then we had to move into town because the traffic was\u2014you
        know, the kids, they would have to leave the house before six in the morning
        to get to school without getting a huge traffic jam because if you left a
        little bit later, then it could take two hours to get to school. It was really
        stop, start\u2014crazy, crazy traffic. So we decided we needed to move in.
        We moved in to an apartment that they could walk to school from. That apartment
        was kind of a miracle that we were able to get that. But then I was commuting
        from there. Halfway back out to where my studio was, there was a studio of
        a friend of mine, so I shared the studio with her for a few years. But that
        wasn\u2019t a situation that was going to continue forever; she moved back
        to her family\u2019s\u2014\n[Laurie arrives with Turgua book (available in
        American Craft Council Library).] Thank you, darling. It\u2019s kind of unfortunate
        that the images are not very good\u2014and it\u2019s in Spanish\u2014but here
        are some pictures of what our pottery sale area looked like.\n00:35:34\nAW:
        Wow.\nGC: Yeah, it was all, kind of, forested.\nAW: Wow.\nGC: This was a day
        when it rained all day, and people came anyway. (Showing image) This was just
        kind desperation\u2014it was, kind of going, (gestures) like that. People
        came out and they would fall and get mud all over their butts, and they were
        smiling and they were having a great time anyway. Really, the more adventurous
        it was, I think, for them, the more they enjoyed it.\nAW: This is a very sweet
        photograph, I think. You and Warren?\nGC: Yeah. I guess I was leaving or something,
        and--\nAW: So all of these potters that joined you, have you stayed in touch
        with them?\nGC: A lot of them I have, yeah.\nAW: Are many of them still in
        Venezuela?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n11\nGC:
        Most of them are not. But you know, life goes on\u2014\nAW: \u2014Were many
        of them from Venezuela?\nGC: There were many from Venezuela. Many from Venezuela,
        and many from abroad, too. The one that I shared a studio with is living in
        Nice now. She was kind of from all over the place, and her mother was living
        in Nice and getting old, so she moved back to take care of her mom, and her
        mom\u2019s since passed away. She\u2019s still there. There\u2019s another
        person who\u2019s in Boston, now, and she was the person who did a lot of
        these wonderful prints. She did woodcuts and stuff.\nThis book was made because
        the editor\u2014the printer\u2014he was really into pots. This just happened,
        you know; it wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s\u2014it was kind of a gift. In one
        sense it\u2019s too bad because it would have been nice if we had had some
        more control over the quality of the images and stuff, but this is a picture
        out of our bedroom window. And this is the area where the pottery sale would
        happen.\nAW: Mm hmm. Which direction are we looking?\nGC: South. That\u2019s
        southeast. So there\u2019s a number of ridges that are going parallel to the
        Andes. At the north end of the South American continent and at the south end
        of the South American continent, they\u2019ve been sheared off so they run
        east-west, so along the northern coast of Venezuela are the Andes, and there\u2019s
        all the foothills of the Andes, so that\u2019s what this area is.\nAW: It\u2019s
        beautiful.\nGC: That\u2019s a picture of my studio.\nAW: Do you have multiple
        copies of that?\nGC: You can have one.\nAW: The American Craft Council might
        [like one]. So this is a multiple copy\u2014not you\u2019re only one?\nGC:
        Yeah, I have several other copies. I\u2019m just not terribly happy with the
        images of the pots. There\u2019s a lot of different levels of\u2014you know,
        people that were closer to beginners\u2014and so. But it\u2019s what it is.\nAW:
        Well, thank you. I think it would be nice to pair with your interview to have
        this.\nGC: Mm hmm.\nAW: So that sale went on until about 2003-2004?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n12\nGC: No, I think 1995
        or so was the last time that we did [one].\nAW: You said that the Tour went
        for about thirteen years?\nGC: \u2014There\u2019s actually\u2014I\u2019ll
        get you another one: I see someone\u2019s actually written some things in
        here, in pencil, so that was nice. I couldn\u2019t swear about the dates.
        So there\u2019s a 2002 Encuentro Turgua, it says here.\n00:40:22\nAW: And
        you started it in 1992?\nGC: Yeah, but it didn\u2019t go on for twenty years.\nAW:
        1992 to 2002 would be eleven or so years.\nGC: Oh, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re
        right. Yeah, it would have gone on until about 2005.\nAW: And how and when
        and why did you decide to leave Venezuela? And why Minnesota?\nGC: Minnesota,
        because after working at Warren\u2019s in \u201984, I started going up there
        every summer. I\u2019d share a studio space with him and his wife Nancy for
        a month\/five weeks. Laurie would come up with the kids, and they would go
        and visit grandparents and have a summer vacation up there. I would spend
        that time making pots at Warren\u2019s studio. After a few years, when he
        decided that he could trust me to be there by myself without making a disaster,
        they started taking off during that time, and I would hold the fort. During
        that time, I met a lot of potters in Minnesota. I met Linda Christiansen\u2014and
        not just Minnesota, but in the area: Randy Johnson, Mark Pharis, Jeff Oestreich.
        And many of those people came to Venezuela to teach. We had this sort of exchange
        going on that was really neat. Warren came twice; Clary Illian came to teach
        after Warren did. I don\u2019t remember who was next, but there were a number
        of people that came to teach. So there was just this connection between Venezuela
        and Minnesota. And since I\u2019d been up here all this time\u2014of course,
        when I\u2019d come up to see Warren, I didn\u2019t have a car, I didn\u2019t
        have a whole lot of mobility\u2014I might borrow his truck and go visit Linda,
        but I didn\u2019t really get to know that much about this area; I was mostly
        there making pots. You know what? I think Minnesota Public Radio had a big
        part in it; just listening to that station gave me so much information about
        Minnesota and so much insight into the values of this community. I guess,
        now looking back, it was probably one of the factors. You know, compared to
        living in the Third World, if you had that juxtaposition\u2014there\u2019s
        so many things that I get the sense that people don\u2019t really appreciate
        about living here. And Minnesota Public Radio was just one of those things
        that I think was just a wonderful resource. There\u2019s always new information;
        there\u2019s all kinds of programs, and you\u2019re there at the wheel, making
        pots, listening to\u2014it\u2019s kind of like a continuing education.\n00:44:23\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n13\nAW: What
        were some of the insights you were learning, or values that were coming across,
        through MPR? What were some of the things that struck a chord with you?\nGC:
        I\u2019m trying to remember what the programs would have been, but just generally,
        so many people calling in with their concerns about their community and with
        the sense that actually something could be done, that there\u2019s some possibility
        of improvement, you know? I think that in my experience in Venezuela, there\u2019s
        kind of a fatalistic attitude that people have, that things are the way they
        are, and nothing\u2019s going to change, so it really isn\u2019t worth making
        the effort. You just have to find a way to navigate the system. That goes
        into this whole culture of corruption, and here it just didn\u2019t seem to
        be that way. It seemed like people were calling in and saying, \u201cHere\u2019s
        this issue, and I\u2019m concerned about it, and we should talk about it.\u201d
        And then there\u2019d be a program about it. Concerns about communities\u2014you
        know, there are so many things about Minnesota that are really kind of interesting
        and intriguing: the immigrant communities. I was just looking at a list where
        Hmong is the, after Spanish and English\u2014they were looking at the states
        and what the most frequently spoken language is\u2014and in Minnesota, it\u2019s
        Hmong. Isn\u2019t that amazing? That embracing of these other communities?
        You know, I\u2019d be on the plane and going to Peru and I\u2019d be sitting
        next to somebody who happened to be from Minnesota, and they were going to
        volunteer at some something: an eye doctor who was working for free distributing
        glasses in poor communities. There seems to be a real sense of collaboration
        and volunteerism, which I thought was really admirable. I liked that whole
        sense of the importance of community.\nAW: Well, speaking of that, how did
        you get to know about the Tour?\nGC: I\u2019d never been here during the Tour.
        I came up here in the summer; I was usually here in July, August. But I knew
        that it happened. I\u2019d heard so much about it, but I\u2019d never had
        that opportunity to come to it. Linda Christiansen and her husband Jeff and
        Laurie and I became very good friends over time, you know\u2014they had been
        to Venezuela a couple of times, we\u2019d done some traveling together, we\u2019d
        been up here to visit them, been at their house, made pots together. So when
        we were looking for a place to move to in the U.S.\u2014we looked other places:
        we went to New Mexico. Laurie had a college buddy there who really wanted
        her to move to that area because they were really close friends\u2014and we
        also looked in Iowa. And Iowa was actually a very, very strong possibility
        because I\u2019d loved Iowa, but for some reason\u2014Laurie was a teacher,
        and she had to get teaching certification, and she couldn\u2019t get it in
        Iowa, but she could here\u2014just bureaucracy issues.\nSo we decided that
        it had to be Minnesota. We just happened to be incredibly fortunate to get
        here at a time when the value of properties was going down. This bubble was
        beginning to deflate, but it hadn\u2019t burst. This house had been reduced
        in price; it had been on the market for over a year and hadn\u2019t sold.
        Laurie found it on the internet, and we came to see it. I couldn\u2019t believe\u2014I
        fell in love with the place. The house is, you know, it\u2019s a house, but
        this general area here? I just didn\u2019t dare dream that we could possibly
        do it, but we were able to get in and buy it. It was really surprising to
        me.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n14\n00:50:05\nAW:
        What attracted you about this area? Are you talking about the landscape? The
        environment?\nGC: My expectations were that we were going to be able to get
        maybe a small farmhouse somewhere, and there would be a field and lots of
        corn, or you know; it was not going to be near the river and with a view.
        You saw the view from our bedroom where we lived in Venezuela. I thought,
        There\u2019s no way we\u2019re gonna get a view. We ended up finding this
        place, and Linda said\u2014Linda was pretty excited\u2014she said, \u201cYou
        know, that\u2019s a great place for being on the Tour.\u201d I had no expectation
        of being on the Tour, either; this was an established institution from a long
        time ago, and I was coming in from abroad without any\u2014I had no idea.
        I mean, this was a completely new adventure to me. So for the first three
        years that I was making pots here\u2014my first firing was in 2007\u20142007,
        8, and 9, I was a guest at Linda\u2019s studio on the Tour. The Tour rules
        are that you have to be a guest for three years. None of these rules, I think,
        are written down. I\u2019ve never seen them written down, but this is what
        I hear: three years before anybody could consider anyone to become actually
        a host studio on the Tour. There used to be a potter on the Tour named Richard
        Abnet, who was just down the road a little ways, and he had retired from the
        Tour for health reasons and then, eventually, he passed away, and they hadn\u2019t
        replaced him, so the Tour was down to six studios from the seven they had
        grown to include.\nOne day, I don\u2019t even remember who called\u2014Laurie
        will probably remember who called\u2014but they had gotten together at some
        point, and decided that they would have me as a host, accept me as part of
        the group. And that\u2019s been wonderful. I mean, a really important platform
        for me and for seven other potters that I have here as guests: some local
        potters like Mike Norman, whom I first met at that sale at Warren\u2019s\u2014\nAW:
        This was back in \u201984?\nGC: Yeah, in \u201984.\nAW: Who are some of the
        other guests?\nGC: I have another guest, who is Dick Cooter from Two Harbors,
        and those are two Minnesota people. Then, I actually had Clary Illian as a
        guest one year. I thought that was very sweet. (Chuckles) Well, Randy Johnston
        and his wife Jan McKeachie have been guests here; now they\u2019re guests
        at Linda\u2019s. Simon Levin is a potter from Gresham, Wisconsin. Stephen
        Rolf, potter from River Falls. Delores Fortuna is a potter from Galena, Illinois.
        And Jim Lorio is from Boulder, Colorado. I think that\u2019s it. Oh!\u2014Sarah
        Jaeger, from Montana.\nAW: That\u2019s right, we talked to Sarah during the
        Tour when we were doing those studio interviews.\nGC: That\u2019s right. Mm-hmm.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n15\nAW: So, besides
        Jim from Colorado and Sarah from Montana, most everyone is Midwest, and really
        Minnesota\/Wisconsin, focused.\nGC: Yeah, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
        and that\u2019s partly because when I became a host, I had to think, Well,
        who am I going to have as guests, and who am I going to reach out to? And
        I didn\u2019t know that many potters in the U.S.\u2014I still don\u2019t.
        I\u2019m getting to know more people mostly because they come through here
        on the Tour. But I haven\u2019t had an opportunity yet to go to many places
        in the U.S. and meet many people from other places.\n00:55:32\nAW: So how
        did you decide, then? What kind of criteria did you have in mind? Or did you
        just know some of these people?\nGC: You know, it\u2019s hard to be totally
        consistent about stuff. I want to give the people who make the kinds of pots
        that have the same intention as the pots that I make to have some sort of
        presence, so I do favor functional pots, but, you know, a lot of Mike\u2019s
        stuff is not functional. It seems like, right now, the ceramic expression
        has moved a lot in the direction of more decorative work. I\u2019m not saying
        that in any critical way, but there\u2019s a lot more focus on really developing
        an individual\u2019s expression, decoration\u2014pots that are not just straight
        pots. So I\u2019m trying to favor, if I can, people that are closer to making
        pots that are kind of unapologetic about being pots. And there\u2019s a whole
        world of people that are doing that sort of thing. Beautiful, really wonderful
        stuff.\nAt the same time, you want to have a diversity of stuff. There\u2019s
        one thing that I learned or experienced, actually for the first time, at that
        sale at Warren\u2019s, which was to mix all the pots together instead of having
        everyone with a separate booth with a separate group of pots and having each
        person standing in front of his stuff. We mix everything up. Well, you were
        here, so you saw how that sort of works and doesn\u2019t work. But that\u2019s
        different from every other place on the Tour. That\u2019s kind of interesting.
        And I get feedback from people that tell me I\u2019m not doing things right.
        (Laughs) At the same time I get feedback from people that say, \u201cI really
        love it that you do that.\u201d I understand that it\u2019s more of a challenge
        for people because if you want to come and see Sarah Jaeger\u2019s work, for
        example, you can\u2019t just come to one spot and see it all and then buy
        the piece there that you want and take off. You have to go through the whole
        place if you want to see all of her work. And then in a sense you\u2019re\u2014forced
        is too strong a word\u2014you\u2019re exposed to things that you might not
        otherwise have made the time for. And you might, you might run into something
        kind of unique and special, something that calls to you. I think that\u2019s
        fun. I understand that, for collectors, it\u2019s more of a challenge. For
        the general public, I think it\u2019s more fun. There\u2019s more of a hunt.\nAW:
        Mm-hmm. How about the visiting artists? What do they say about it?\nGC: Well,
        (laughing) they don\u2019t say much about it. I think people are\u2014at least
        to me, there haven\u2019t been any complaints. Maybe people are being polite,
        and they don\u2019t want to complain. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n16\nBut, you know, our results are good. Our sales are
        as good as we could\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014Bob says, \u201cThey\u2019d
        be better if you did it my way.\u201d I don\u2019t know that. (Laughs) And
        I love Bob. I think he does a great job, and he\u2019s done a really wonderful\u2014he
        has a wonderful effect on the Tour. His enthusiasm, and his energy, has been
        just a great motor for the Tour.\n[Later comment on this question from GC:
        I favor utilitarian work because there is a current trend toward \u201cart
        pots\u201d. Often highly decorated and where function is not a primary concern
        and I want to support \u201cstraight\u201d potters. I value diversity because
        it makes it more fun for the pottery lovers that attend our event. It is critical
        that my guests understand that the Tour at my studio is more than a collection
        of individual potters. I require that all the pots be mixed together because
        we are together presenting the pots. The pots are the stars of this event.]\n01:00:34\nAW:
        By having the artists present their work all together, because everything
        is mixed together, do you think that kind of builds a camaraderie between
        them?\nGC: Absolutely. Absolutely. To me, it\u2019s all about having a community
        here doing everything for the benefit of the group and not just having a situation
        where people come and set up their own stuff, and then they go back to the
        hotel. Here we\u2019re not done setting up until the last pot is out, whether
        its mine or whosoever\u2019s it is. So we have to keep going and keep working
        at it. One comment I wanted to make, before I forget, was that also I believe
        that if you mix the pots up, they set each other off, and they look better.
        If you have a whole, huge table full of wood-fired pots, where you have these
        rich, beautiful wood-fired surfaces, but they\u2019re all similar, and they\u2019re
        all one next to the other, if you put one of Sarah Jaeger\u2019s wonderful
        porcelain pieces, and then have that in between a couple of wood-fired pots,
        those wood-fired pots are going to just sing. They\u2019re gonna look so much
        better. That contrast is so important, I think. You don\u2019t have that possibility\u2026
        There was something else that you were asking before that about mixing them
        all.\nAW: Yeah, about mixing them all up, that that kind of process then brings
        all of the artists together\u2014it sounds like everyone generally, at each
        studio, helps each other out. This way, it\u2019s a little bit more involved.\nGC:
        Yeah. It\u2019s part of the process.\nAW: So what are more parts of the process,
        getting the Tour set up here for your studio? How do you get things set up?
        What are some of the traditions you guys have for the studio?\nGC: The Tour
        happens on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I start setting out surfaces on
        the Monday before. Every year I promise myself that I\u2019m going to be ready
        earlier because there\u2019s so much that happens, and it just happens to
        be my house, so everything that happens kind of has to go through me because
        people want to come up and ask me, \u201cIs it okay if I do this? Is it okay
        if I do that?\u201d It\u2019s getting much better and much easier as time
        goes on and as we\u2019ve done it A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n17\nseveral times. Some of the guests pretty much \u2014I
        know I couldn\u2019t do it without them. Some people arrived on Tuesday because,
        the arrangement of the surfaces, we vary that just for fun so that the circulation
        patterns of people are a little different, and try to play with how they\u2019re
        gonna move and which would be the best way to maybe try to induce people to
        get to this side of the house, which is the back of the house, and people
        aren\u2019t so attracted to coming back here. So Tuesday we start getting
        those things out. And I try to get my pots out on Tuesday. Wednesday, everyone
        arrives, and then we have a welcome feast: make a paella and have just generally\u2014you
        know, people are tired, they just unpack all of their pots and get a little
        bit done. But this Wednesday, this time, there were some potters that had
        already been there from Tuesday, and they got most of their stuff out. So
        then they can help facilitate for the ones that are arriving on Thursday,
        and things get finished up. Set-up gets finished up. Then Thursday, there\u2019s
        a dinner at Connee\u2019s, so you\u2019ve gotta be done before that dinner,
        and then you want to go to bed fairly early because Friday is showtime; you\u2019ve
        gotta get a good night\u2019s sleep, if you can sleep. (Laughing) It just
        goes by so fast. There are so many things to do: you\u2019ve got to put the
        signs up, you\u2019ve gotta run down to the liquor store and pick up the kegs
        and get that set up, and go down to the gentleman we rent a golf cart from.
        I think the fact that I came in more or less recently gives me kind of the
        opportunity to have a fresher look at what we need to do. To me the golf cart
        was a no-brainer\u2014I mean, having a shuttle, you know? People are willing
        to walk, and a lot of times people don\u2019t want to get on the golf cart
        because they feel that\u2019s not proper, or, you should walk\u2014you got
        that. I mean, people like to ski uphill here, you know? (Laughing)\n01:06:32\nAW:
        Exactly. That\u2019s very Minnesotan: \u201cAh, we\u2019ll just walk.\u201d\nGC:
        So you have to cajole them. \u201cOh, come on, I\u2019m--\u201d\nAW: --offering
        a ride. Are you not going to take it? (Laughs)\nGC: Eventually, you get people
        on there. People come out with a couple of big bags of pots, and some people
        are older. So that, to me, seemed like a good idea, but it was viewed with
        a certain suspicion. It was kind of like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d
        (Laughs) But it\u2019s worked out pretty well.\nAW: Because some driveways
        are pretty steep. You have a steep driveway, and Bob does, too.\nGC: Linda\u2019s
        got a long driveway.\nAW: Yeah, like the Tour that happened this year when
        it was so rainy, I could imagine just that it\u2019s better to be on the golf
        cart\u2014\nGC: \u2014Yeah, to get back to the car\u2014\nAW: \u2014than slipping
        with your new purchase. So the golf cart was one thing that you introduced
        to the group? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n18\nGC:
        Yeah, I think that was my idea.\nAW: Are there other things that you\u2019re
        seeing with kind of a new perspective?\nGC: I never would have thought of
        myself as being anything like involved in marketing or management or promotion
        or anything like that, but I got invited to be part of the marketing committee,
        which is Bob, Will Swanson, and me, which basically means we get together
        and have a couple of beers and talk. (Laughs) So that\u2019s where a lot of
        those ideas come up. We talk about how things\u2014what would make it better.\nAW:
        Is there a favorite bar you guys go to?\nGC: Yeah, we go to Al\u2019s in Center
        City a lot. I mean, we don\u2019t go a lot, but that\u2019s the place we go
        most often. Al is a glassblower, so he\u2019s got his bar as a sideline or
        his glassblowing as a sideline\u2014I don\u2019t know which is which. But
        yeah, it\u2019s a nice little place.\nAW: Are there some marketing ideas that
        have come up since you\u2019ve joined that could help the Tour? Or, how does
        marketing play a role in the Tour?\nGC: A lot of it has to do with things
        that are beginning to evolve a little bit like, What are we to do about social
        media, electronic media, email? There didn\u2019t used to be an email list.
        Now we\u2019re actually actively taking emails and sending emails out. Social
        media: Facebook page, Likes, posting stuff\u2014how do you actually get people
        to post things, you know?\nAW: Is there a page for the Tour?\nGC: Yeah.\nAW:
        Who goes on? Do all of you go on there and post stuff, and like stuff, etc.?\nGC:
        Yeah, there\u2019s several of us that are administrators so we can post stuff.
        But I think even if you\u2019re not, you can share things on the page. We
        try to get the potters that are coming as guests to share what they\u2019re
        doing to prepare for the Tour on that page. Some of them are more media-savvy
        than others. Some of them don\u2019t have\u2014(Laughs) you know, it\u2019s
        just all over the place.\n01:10:20\nAW: Mm hmm.\nGC: But it\u2019s really
        neat, I think, because people really respond when they start seeing pots in
        process, and a firing coming out, and these are pots going to the Tour. You
        start getting a little bit of a buzz going on: \u201cThe Tour\u2019s coming
        up!\u201d I think that\u2019s been really a good deal. There\u2019s just a
        lot that can be done, and of course we\u2019re all primarily potters and we
        all have to make A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n19\npots\u2014you
        almost need to have a full-time job to have people be able to do all that
        you could be doing to get the word out. But I think things are getting better.
        For example, I\u2019m going to the Mill City Farmers Market. I\u2019ve been
        doing that for this, I think, is my fourth year. This summer I\u2019ll be
        there four times. It\u2019s not really that great a place for me to sell pots\u2014I
        sell some. But it\u2019s a fabulous place to connect with a really good clientele.
        So I take flyers from this year\u2019s tour, and get a chance to talk to a
        lot of people: \u201cHave you been on the Tour?\u201d You\u2019d be surprised
        how few people\u2014general public\u2014they don\u2019t really know about
        it. There\u2019s a whole world of people out there that could still be made
        aware that this exists. People move away, for some reason or other they drop
        out and they stop coming, so you always have to be getting new people interested.
        People get to the point where they can\u2019t fit another pot in their houses.
        I get a lot of that when I talk to these people. And I make this joke that,
        \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to start selling shelving units, as well, with
        the pots because you need a place to put them.\u201d You need to connect with
        people that are younger people that are starting out, maybe, that are moving
        into an apartment, that need a few cups.\nAW: And do you think social media
        might be a way to do that, too?\nGC: I think so.\nAW: Who are you guys looking
        at with the Facebook page? Is it the younger audience? Is it regular visitors?\nGC:
        There are some savvy older people, and then there are a lot of young people.
        And then I hear that a lot of young people are moving away from Facebook,
        that it\u2019s no longer the place to go, and I worry. I\u2019m just getting
        clued into Facebook, and now I\u2019m gonna have to figure out where we go
        from here.\nAW: The next social media site.\nGC: Yeah. And we\u2019ve been
        using Minnesota Public Radio, which I think is absolutely perfect. That\u2019s
        exactly the audience that\u2019s going to be interested in pots.\nAW: When
        you have people post pictures or news about putting stuff in the kiln, to
        me it seems like a way that people could learn about the process and be somewhat
        involved in the process. Do you feel like that, too, is a way to bring people
        into the process a bit, to help them get excited about it because they\u2019re
        hearing about the different stages?\nGC: What I can say is that when I post
        things about\u2014I\u2019ll show you my personal page, but, let\u2019s see,
        here\u2019s my pottery page\u2014(shows Facebook page on computer)\nAW: So
        you\u2019re posting, too, as well as your guest artists.\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n20\nGC: I have my own page,
        which I keep posting on. These are glazed casseroles. Next weekend, at St.
        Anthony Park, there\u2019s an art fair, and I\u2019ll be there. So I\u2019m
        putting up a few things about the St. Anthony Park Art Fair. Here\u2019s some
        pictures of the Tour, here.\n01:15:45\nAW: That\u2019s definitely not on Friday,
        when we were here. Must have been on Sunday?\nGC: Can you imagine that?\nAW:
        When we were there it was raining. Gorgeous photo of you and the group!\nGC:
        And the group, mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know what this means here when they say
        that this post \u201cwas served to\u201d; it used to be \u201cwas viewed by\u201d
        or \u201copened by\u201d or something like that. Now it says it\u2019s \u201cserved
        to\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t know what that means, but\u2014it\u2019s fifteen
        hundred people. That\u2019s something, an activity, and these were some pots
        that were coming out. So these things really attract attention, a lot of people
        looking at them. 849 people looking at the first pots I put out in the springtime
        to dry for the Tour? 1,080 people looked at these baking dishes. People really
        like to see something that\u2019s happening. Like: there was a little tiny
        clip of a video that a friend of mine took\u2014or, Laurie took\u2014of me
        glazing a bowl; a huge number of people wanted to take a look at it. When
        you put something like \u201cSpiritworks Pottery,\u201d 148 people saw it.
        It\u2019s still me posting something about pots, but people aren\u2019t really
        that interested in looking at\u2014The \u201cYunomi Invitational\u201d [Japanese
        style drinking cup]. This is at the Akar Gallery in Iowa; it\u2019s the biggest
        Yunomi event in the country, in the year, so I\u2019m promoting it there,
        I have some pots there, 116 people saw it. Those things people aren\u2019t
        that interested in. They\u2019re really interested in seeing the actual process.
        And St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour\u2014this is the St. Croix Valley Pottery
        Tour page, so there\u2019s also a page that\u2019s St. Croix Valley Potters\u2019
        Tour. This was at Will Swanson\u2019s. Then, I shared mine with that one,
        too. And then these were some pieces from potters before the Tour here: somebody\u2019s
        packing a kiln. And this page has about 1,600 \u201cLikes,\u201d so then that
        goes out to this 1,600 people, and maybe they spread the word, share it. They
        liked it, so they\u2019re the people that you really want to have that information.\nAW:
        Do you think it has made a difference in how many people are attending?\nGC:
        Well, we get more people every year. It\u2019s hard to tell why. I tried to
        do a survey, but surveys are really not that easy to do. To do a really good
        survey, to get a lot of people, you actually need to get somebody that\u2019s
        just doing that and maybe interviewing people, trying to get information.
        We are getting more people, but I don\u2019t know how much of it is this?
        How much of it is MPR? And this year there wasn\u2019t that much more than
        last year, so who knows? We\u2019re just potters, you know, and most of us
        don\u2019t really want to spend a whole lot of time doing that kind of thing.\nAW:
        Who are some of the people who come to visit your studio?\nGC: During the
        Tour? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n21\nAW:
        Mm-hmm. Are they from around this area? Are they from the Cities? Are they
        from the Midwest? Or are they from all over the world? Where are they coming
        from, and are they families, or couples, friends, students?\n01:20:15\nGC:
        There are families, couples, friends, students\u2014there\u2019s just everything.
        There are young people. There are people that are coming from Bemidji, from
        a school group of ceramics students. They come down here and they want to
        see the studio, and they want to do a little tour. There was something I was
        going to say that was\u2014oh, you were asking about the number of people
        that come and where they come from\u2014let\u2019s see, we started to take
        zip codes to find out more or less where people were coming from. I had people
        from twenty-four states come through this studio\u2014not this year, but last
        year. This year I haven\u2019t checked that. And a few other countries: there
        were people from Chile, I know there\u2019ve been people from France. I don\u2019t
        know who was here this year, but people do come from abroad. Just to get people
        from half the states in the United States almost to come out here, it\u2019s
        a big deal.\nI\u2019m involved with an organization that\u2019s right now
        based in Stillwater called ArtReach St. Croix. Its mission is to make the
        St. Croix Valley a national destination for arts and culture. They\u2019re
        all about promoting and marketing arts and culture in the St. Croix Valley
        from Taylor\u2019s Falls and St. Croix Falls down to Hastings and Prescott\u2014that
        section of the river. They have a website called the St. Croix Splash where
        you can go and see what events are going on and what\u2019s posted for the
        rest of the year. You can put in a date; if you happen to have family coming
        in from somewhere else in the country, you can see what\u2019s happening that
        weekend, whether it''s the Festival Theater, whether it\u2019s Franconia,
        whether it\u2019s farmers markets, wine tastings, music, concerts, pottery
        sales, all these events, theater\u2014it\u2019s all in this one resource.
        I think it\u2019s really productive to try to get this area known for that
        because it\u2019s incredibly rich. It\u2019s amazing when you start looking.
        If you go to St. Croix Splash and you start looking at all of the things that
        are going on at one time, it\u2019s pretty amazing. People talk about Door
        County\u2014Door County has generated that kind of image of being a culture
        area\u2014and I think that\u2019s what the Tour contributes greatly to. We\u2019re
        bringing so many people into this area from all over, but it\u2019s something
        that only happens once in the year. But there are so many things going on
        the rest of the year, and of course we\u2019re here the rest of the year,
        so we\u2019d like to continue to have people come into the studio and buy
        pots or whatever. (Laughs)\nAW: Is there something unique about this area
        that draws so many artists or cultural events?\nGC: Well there\u2019s the
        river. The river is a huge thing. There\u2019s an incredibly beautiful natural
        environment, and that makes a huge impact.\nAW: How so?\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n22\nGC: It\u2019s just the context.
        Well, this is what happened to us in Venezuela: we had our pottery sale outside
        Venezuela [Caracas], we couldn\u2019t make enough pots\u2014we\u2019d sell
        everything. We were given the opportunity to have a very nice small house
        in the city with a nice clay tile roof. It was a very sweet little place.
        We fixed it up, and we had a little courtyard and plants, and we did all kinds
        of activities there. We had shows, we had our store, always somebody there
        taking care of it; workshops, events of all different kinds. And we had the
        pots at the same prices as we had them out at my place, and you didn\u2019t
        have to drive, you know, sixty miles down a death-defying little road with
        cliffs on either side, and we just couldn\u2019t really move the pots very
        well. You\u2019d sell some pots, but it wasn\u2019t the same response. I think
        the context of being out in an area where there are no distractions and where
        it\u2019s a beautiful place to be and you\u2019re happy to be there, it makes
        such a difference in just being able to appreciate. So I think people associate
        the work with the place. You can imagine\u2014have you been to Franconia Sculpture
        Park?\n01:26:03\nAW: Mm-hmm.\nGC: Have you been there for concerts? That\u2019s
        kind of fun. You should do that this summer; they have really good music.
        Then, you know, just to be in a really nice place and bring your picnic basket
        or little cooler and have a beer and listen to some good music\u2014it just
        becomes a really charming situation. I think that has a great impact. So the
        context is huge, I think.\nAW: And what about the potters involved in the
        Tour? Has the Tour made this place known as a cultural hub, or is there something
        unique about the group of potters involved in the Tour?\nGC: Well, they\u2019re
        very good potters. I think there\u2019s a priority of making very good work.
        I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m saying that the way I intend it to sound. But
        it\u2019s more important to make good pots than to have a big sale. The sale
        is a consequence of having some really good work that\u2019s being made. I
        think that\u2019s really important. If you have a very good sale, but you
        don''t have really very good work\u2014I think that quality has really been
        important to create that image of the Tour.\nAW: The high quality of work?\nGC:
        I think having very well-respected potters from all over the United States
        obviously helps immeasurably, too. You have people that come from all over
        the U.S. On our invitation this year, there\u2019s a map of the country and
        lines to where all the potters come from, and I don\u2019t remember how many
        different states are represented by the potters, but it\u2019s many. The fact
        that they want to come here, and their work is of very good quality and they\u2019re
        recognized\u2014all of that is of mutual benefit: the Tour benefits, and they
        obviously come here and sell a lot of work. So it\u2019s good for everybody.\nAW:
        Mm-hmm.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n23\nGC:
        It\u2019s interesting because there is a thought, quite often, in all areas
        but among artists that if someone sells a piece, then that\u2019s one less
        piece that I can sell, you know?\u2014kind of that sense that you don\u2019t
        want to have too many people because then the sales will be less. It\u2019s
        actually the opposite: the more you offer, the bigger your market becomes
        and the bigger your audience becomes. I think in the beginning, there were
        no guests at all, so there were seven potters. This year we had fifty-one
        potters. And the amount of sales, I\u2019m sure it has not decreased for those
        seven. I\u2019d have to ask, but I think it\u2019s probably gone well above
        what they used to sell. It just becomes that much more interesting for people,
        so you get so many more people to come out.\n01:30:15\nAW: What was it like
        when you were invited to be a host on the Tour? What was it like coming into
        the group? What was that first year like for you\u2014in 2010?\nGC: Yeah,
        I had already been at Linda\u2019s as a guest, so I had some idea what the
        Tour event would be like. It\u2019s always kind of scary. The Tour itself,
        I always feel here, that it\u2019s just a barely controlled chaos. It\u2019s
        just almost falling apart all the time. Just trying to be ready and make sure
        that nothing is going to go wrong is kind of scary, and also not wanting to
        let anybody else down by doing something inappropriate in some way, you know?
        I mean I speak English, and I\u2019ve spoken English all my life, so I sound
        like I know, but I haven\u2019t ever lived in the U.S.\u2014or hadn\u2019t
        ever lived in the U.S. before\u2014so there were a lot of things that, culturally,
        were totally clueless. Like I had no idea that some things might be misinterpreted.
        They\u2019re small things, but they all add up. Maybe it was more in my mind
        and in my head than in reality, I\u2019m not really sure. But to me, it was
        a great opportunity and I wanted it to work. One thing that\u2019s really
        interesting about this group, too, and it\u2019s very charming and wonderful,
        is that they\u2019re seven separate studios that operate totally independently.
        There are some ground rules, some rules that are rules, like: only ceramics;
        there\u2019s not supposed to be anything other than pots for sale. But aside
        from that, you could have one guest or you could have no guests. The maximum
        is eight. I think you can have eight, like Bob. (Laughs) I think Jeff is the
        one who\u2019s most\u2014he\u2019ll have maybe two or three guests. And what
        you decide to do\u2014you know, this year, three studios decided to have food
        trucks, which is a new thing. We did something very similar to that in Venezuela.
        It worked out very well for us in Venezuela. But this is a completely different
        culture and a different place, so who knows? I\u2019m really interested to
        hear what people say about that in our meeting.\nAW: Now, because we were
        here, you had some food that you served\u2014it was all very delicious\u2014did
        you make that? Or did people bring stuff and contribute?\nGC: That\u2019s
        one thing that\u2019s really an important point. We couldn\u2019t possibly
        do this without all these people that come to help. Most of them are just
        volunteering because they think it\u2019s a fun event, and they want to contribute
        to something that\u2019s kind of exciting and fun, and in the end they end
        up getting some, maybe, pots as a gift\u2014but absolutely nothing that is
        equivalent to the amount of effort that they put in to make it happen. I require
        that all the guests bring one person as a helper because the artists themselves
        are supposed to be available to talk to the public all the time; they\u2019re
        not supposed to be doing any work\u2014any schlepping, or driving the golf
        cart, or A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n24\nanything
        like that. They\u2019re supposed to be standing around, and if anybody wants
        to engage with them, they have to be there for that. So they need to have
        somebody that\u2019s there that will help with the setup, that\u2019ll help
        with wrapping pots and bagging pots and the checkout and everything. Then
        there\u2019s a whole bunch of people that are local\u2014friends of ours and
        people that have decided that they want to be part of the situation. Because
        the checkout is sensitive, you know; you\u2019re managing all this money and
        using a computer program so you\u2019re inputting information, and you have
        to try to minimize human error because that error just makes it harder to
        reconcile and do all the work. These are people that work very hard. And in
        the kitchen, there\u2019s one person who has been a caterer in her life\u2014she
        works at a co-op in the Cities\u2014and she\u2019s extremely professional
        at making food. There\u2019s some really good amateurs. Then, there\u2019s
        a woman who\u2019s the manager of one of the best restaurants in the Cities\u2014she
        actually did art in school\u2014and she enjoys being part of the art scene,
        and she\u2019s, you know, just fabulous in the kitchen. So we have these people
        in the kitchen that are unbelievable. A lot of kids that help carry food in
        and out, help chop, help do this and help do that, wash dishes\u2014we have
        somebody washing dishes permanently. I like to use my own pots, I like to
        make pots\u2014and actually next year, I\u2019m hoping that a couple of the
        other potters that are my guests will also contribute some of their own pots
        to serve the food because, the first time we had the sale, we had eight or
        ten contractor bags of garbage\u2014these huge bags of plastic and paper and
        spoons and cups, and it was like, \u201cThis is totally the wrong message.\u201d
        We\u2019re making pots partly because we want something that is going to be
        reused and it\u2019s going to be appreciated, and this, that, and the other.
        I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna make some beer tumblers, like those things,
        the smaller wine cup, a bowl, and a plate, and we\u2019re gonna just use that
        stuff.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I was going to sell them, I was just going
        to make a bunch and we would have them and we would use them, but as soon
        as people got \u2019em in their hands, they, especially the wine cups for
        some reason, they\u2019ve just gotta have \u2019em. So by the middle of Saturday,
        there were no wine cups left. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling Jim Lorio and
        Dick [Cooter] and these other people, \u201cListen, would you guys make a
        few of these, too?\u201d We need to have twice as many next year so that we
        don\u2019t have to go back to the paper cups. It\u2019s a little more work;
        people have to wash and then put them back out again and all that, but it\u2019s
        so neat. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people ask me, \u201cCan you use
        this stuff?\u201d\n01:38:42\nAW: Yeah, I remember on that Friday afternoon,
        we were getting ready to leave, and there were a couple of people trying to
        find matching wine tumblers and trying to get those together to buy them,
        and (Laughing) I\u2019m not surprised they were all sold out by the following
        day.\nGC: The thing is, they\u2019re a little fussy to make; they\u2019re
        little, and I want to make something else, I don\u2019t want to just make
        hundreds of those. But it really is nice to see people using them.\nAW: So
        what do you do to prepare for the Tour? What is your own process, and how
        many things do you make? When do you start producing things for the Tour?
        Can you walk us through that?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n25\nGC:
        Well, this year I had a workshop, so I was gone most of January. But really
        what I should be doing is, by the end of December, start[ing] to accumulate
        inventory. But you always have plans to do all of these things, and I talk
        to my guests, and, you know, life intervenes. There\u2019s always something
        that happens and you don\u2019t get quite as much work done as you would like.
        It\u2019s basically about spending the winter making pots. There\u2019s a
        lot of work, a lot of it that Laurie does, with mailing list work. We mail\u2014I\u2019m
        trying to remember how many; it was in the high twenties\u2014maybe 28,000
        flyers. Those mailing lists have to compiled and duplicates and all of this
        work. People send in mailing lists, and all of that has to be put together.
        There are a few deadlines to get that flyer designed, but Will Swanson\u2019s
        been doing that in the last few years: the design of the flyer. What else
        do we have to do?\nAW: Is this the first sale that you have for the season?
        Or is there something before this?\nGC: I actually had one the weekend before
        in Osceola, which is a very small sale. It\u2019s at a place called The Art
        Barn, and it\u2019s a show called The Friends Show. There\u2019s a painter
        who focuses on the St. Croix River called Jim Dimmers and a pair of jewelers,
        also from Wisconsin, and a woman from Marine on St. Croix who does fiberwork
        and cards, paper and stuff. I like to do that because my whole eventual goal
        is to generate enough of a local audience that I\u2019ll get people [to] come
        during the year if they need a wedding gift or a birthday present or a cup
        or whatever, to have them come by. That\u2019s why I do that one. I do the
        Marine Art Fair, and I do another one in Taylor\u2019s Falls, so I do three
        shows that are kind of local around here. And this year there\u2019s one,
        going to be happening at Scandia, that has to do with their farmer\u2019s
        market. Because there\u2019s enough of a population around here that if you
        got people to be aware and conscious that instead of going on Amazon and ordering
        something, they could just come\u2014(Laughing) me and my marketing genius,
        right? But yeah, I\u2019d rather do that than go to Philadelphia or have shows
        in different areas nationally.\nAW: So you go to about three or four in this
        year\u2019s shows, plus this tour, so five?\nGC: That, and then in the Cities
        there\u2019s Mill City [Farmers Market], there\u2019s the St. Anthony Park
        event, there\u2019s a place called the White Bear Center for the Arts, and
        there\u2019s going to be an event there in July. I keep telling myself I\u2019ve
        gotta stop doing quite so many. And I really do have to do that. I want to
        spend more time in the studio making pots and just getting a little more relaxed
        rhythm going to life. It\u2019s been really busy trying to get everything
        to work at this point, and now I think I get this sense that now I can take
        a little bit more time to make pots and less time carrying pots around. I\u2019m
        looking forward to that.\n01:44:18\nAW: When you were in Venezuela, were you
        also doing a lot of art fairs, plus the sale that you hosted, too? What was
        that like there?\nGC: Mostly, I didn\u2019t. Mostly I did those two sales.
        Then we did one or two here and there, and an occasional show, but really,
        our Encuentro was what we all worked towards. Since it A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n26\nhappened twice a year, it was
        good\u2014it balanced. I\u2019m trying to do that now here: to have a fall
        sale, which I\u2019m trying to promote. Actually, Linda\u2019s going to be
        a guest, and a couple of other people\u2014actually Jim from Boulder: Jim
        Lorio. And there\u2019s a woman who works with a group of weavers from Peru
        called Melanie Ebertz\u2014her place is Art Andes. Melanie works with these
        weavers, and a percentage of all the sales goes to a foundation and helps
        provide food for kids in schools in Peru. She\u2019s going to be part of our
        fall sale. Since it\u2019s my fall sale, I can do whatever I want, so I\u2019m
        gonna have somebody that\u2019s not a potter. I\u2019m going to have a guest
        that\u2019s not a potter at all of my fall sales.\nLast year, there\u2019s
        this event that Art Reach has organized\u2014it\u2019s called Take Me to the
        River\u2014and there are a number of events that happen on the last two weekends
        in September, the second half of September. There\u2019s a number\u2014there\u2019s
        Afton Art Fair, Franconia has some events, the Festival Theater has some,
        Marine Art Fair, in Stillwater I think they call it Log Jam Days now, so there\u2019s
        a number of events. And they set up a tent at each one of these events, and
        they tried to get people to go to the other ones. They promote and they make
        a rack card and brochure, and they do a bunch of stuff\u2014I\u2019m part
        of that, and that\u2019s really increased the number of people that have come
        by here during the fall sale. So the idea is to try to balance it out so you
        don\u2019t just have this one big sale in the spring and then, by the time
        you get around to January, it\u2019s starting to get really (Laughing) really
        tight.\nAW: When you\u2019re producing stuff in the winter, are you making
        enough stuff to carry you through the summer season? Or do you continue to
        be making your work throughout the summer?\nGC: I have to keep working. Right
        now, I\u2019m worried about going to St. Anthony Park next weekend and not
        having, really, a whole lot of stuff. The Tour was a pretty big deal, and
        since I was gone in January, I hadn\u2019t been able to make as much as I\u2014and
        then, you know, I have to say, \u201cWell, but then you went to the Boundary
        Waters.\u201d So I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m just thinking that if
        I hadn\u2019t gone to the Boundary Waters, I\u2019d be getting to a firing
        right about now, so I\u2019d have more pots. Anyway, that\u2019s that idea
        that maybe I need to just accept that I\u2019m not going to make quite as
        many pots, and accept fewer commitments. In the past it was just really important
        for me to get out there and be out there and have my pots out there, and people
        would come up to me and say, \u201cI see your name everywhere!\u201d It\u2019s
        kind of embarrassing; it\u2019s kind of like, \u201cOh my God, what am I doing?\u201d
        But this is it. I don\u2019t have a Plan B: I need to sell those pots and
        make a living.\nAW: Do you find it also helps you connect to local communities
        around here? To meet your neighbors and everything?\nGC: Oh, absolutely. Yeah.\nAW:
        And that seems to be something important to you.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n27\nGC: To me, yeah, absolutely. And the
        small things\u2014like this Art Barn\u2014because there are less people that
        come, you get more of a chance to talk to them. Then you realize that you
        have connections, that they know somebody that you know, and you begin to
        become a little more a part of the community. They say, you know, you\u2019re
        always the new person; your kids may end up being from here (Laughs), but
        it takes forever to become more part of the community.\nAW: Speaking of that,
        where are your kids now?\nGC: They went to college, they graduated from college.
        Our daughter works at a non-profit in Chicago that\u2019s an art school for
        disadvantaged kids.\nAW: What\u2019s her name?\nGC: Her name is Alana.\nAW:
        How do you spell that?\nGC: A-l-a-n-a. It\u2019s a really neat school; it\u2019s
        called Marwen\u2014M-a-r-w-e-n. They have a great program. They have teachers
        that come in from all over that come and do classes in photography, printing,
        different kinds of visual arts, some ceramics\u2014they\u2019re limited by
        their facilities right now, but they have this wonderful building and a gallery
        space, and they have shows, and the kids really respond. It\u2019s really
        neat. So she\u2019s very happy with that. But she\u2019s getting a little
        sick of living in Chicago.\n01:50:43\nAW: Did she go to college in Chicago?\nGC:
        She went to college in Ohio. Both of them went to school at a college called
        Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.\nAW: So nobody went for Cornell for a third generation?\nGC:
        No. No, and I\u2019m happy with that. I didn\u2019t tell them what to study,
        either. It didn''t work for my dad, so I figured, Why waste the time?\nAW:
        And your son?\nGC: He actually lives in Marine [on St. Croix]. He got out
        of school and did a VISTA program for awhile, and then came back here. Of
        course, he didn\u2019t want to stay here\u2014he got some work in a restaurant,
        first here in Wisconsin, and then he got involved with this restaurant in
        Marine, which is called the Brookside. It\u2019s a bar and grill, but it\u2019s
        a really nice bar and grill, and it\u2019s a really nice group of people that
        work there and run the place. And now he\u2019s got a small share, so A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n28\nhe\u2019s kind of
        a partner, so now he\u2019s got all the headaches of being the one that has
        to manage the place. But yeah, it\u2019s nice to have him nearby.\nAW: And
        what\u2019s his name?\nGC: Carlos.\nAW: Have they had experience with pottery,
        ceramics?\nGC: Yeah, they made pots when they were little kids, playing with
        the clay and stuff, and then, occasionally, a little something, but not really.
        I didn\u2019t ever really push that on them. And they didn\u2019t particularly\u2014now
        my daughter\u2019s taking ceramics classes in Chicago. I find that kind of
        amusing! (Laughs)\nAW: Is that through work?\nGC: No, not through work. Just
        for fun, yeah.\nAW: What has she had to say about it?\nGC: Oh, she enjoys
        it. All she\u2019s said is that she ha a great time and that it\u2019s a lot
        of fun. (Laughing)\nAW: Speaking of your parents, did they\u2014\nGC: \u2014No
        art in the background.\nAW: It didn\u2019t sound like it. What about when
        it looked like it was beginning to become your career?\nGC: I think, eventually,
        my dad eventually was kind of\u2014he couldn\u2019t understand it, but there
        were a lot of people that he kind of admired because they were involved in
        the\u2014how do I say this?\u2014people that were wealthy and educated in
        Venezuela, he had dealings with a lot of those people because they were also
        the owners of a lot of the farms where he was actually representing this dairy
        equipment from the United States, so he had milking machines and he\u2019d
        come back to the Midwest and buy dairy cattle and ship them back to Venezuela\u2014so
        he had this relationship with people that were well-educated and, financially,
        they were the economy, kind of, of the country, and they were showing up at
        shows where I was part of a group show or something like that. And it was
        kind of like, \u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s something there, I just don\u2019t
        have a clue.\u201d So I think he began to come around a little bit towards
        the end. And of course my mom now thinks everything is just incredible. And
        Laurie\u2019s mom has been fantastic; she\u2019s just a really wonderful booster
        and supporter. I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that Laurie\u2019s sister
        is a papermaker\u2014she\u2019s an extraordinary papermaker\u2014and I think
        that Terry\u2019s really proud of us doing this. A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n29\n01:55:35\nAW: Now, what did Laurie
        study in college?\nGC: Biology. Then she got a master\u2019s in education,
        so she was teaching second\/third grade.\nAW: And where did she grow up?\nGC:
        Mason City, Iowa.\nAW: Has she also worked with clay? Sometimes you\u2019ve
        referred to both of you making pottery, so I wonder how that\u2019s worked?\nGC:
        She has. Yeah, we\u2019ve done some things, and she has worked with clay,
        but not so much recently. Since we came to the States, first she taught for
        a year, and then she\u2019s really been basically doing everything that I
        don\u2019t do that has to do with the pottery: photography, Photoshop, designing
        cards, mailing lists\u2014all of that\u2014just a huge amount of work. If
        she weren\u2019t doing that, I just couldn\u2019t possibly make enough pots.
        That\u2019s a pretty big job.\nAW: Mm-hmm. So you met at Cornell your first
        year?\nGC: Mm-hmm.\nAW: And then through all of your traveling, too, you stayed
        in touch? Or did you reconnect once you went back to Cornell to finish your
        degree?\nGC: Well, there was a kind of a hiatus. I was not particularly good
        at writing letters or staying in contact, but there was some contact\u2014enough
        contact, I guess, that eventually when I came back, we started to go out again.
        It hadn\u2019t ever officially ended, but it had been kind of in a state of
        suspended animation. (Laughs)\nAnd one thing I haven\u2019t mentioned at all
        is that in 1984, or \u201983, I went up to California and talked to a guy
        called Bill Abbott, who had lived in Venezuela, and he was the owner of a
        company called Wilderness Travel. I started to guide trips for them in Venezuela.
        These were wilderness trips: trekking and canoeing\u2014dugout canoes with
        the Indians, traveling through the base of Angel Falls and hiking up to the
        top of these tabletop mountains in Southeast Venezuela\u2014really, very,
        incredibly beautiful area. And there were trips that were anywhere from eighteen
        to twenty-one days long, in the beginning, and I was absolutely chief cook
        and bottle-washer. So I would be drying food, drying veggies, and doing all
        of the packing, and then driving. It was a two-day drive to get down to where
        the trek began in order to communicate with the Indians and tell them that
        we were coming (because we would need porters and we would need an assistant).
        And there was no way to communicate with them other than taking four days
        and just going down there and talking to them, giving them the date, and hoping
        that A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n30\nwhen
        you got there, they were there\u2014and chartering small planes that would
        fly us from one area to the other area where we got into the dugouts, and
        also getting in touch with that set of Indians on that end that were related
        but not the same, and picking people up at the airport, dealing with lost
        bags, getting all of the local tickets, all the travel arrangements done.
        It was a huge job, and extremely scary, in the beginning, for me to have a
        group of twelve to fifteen people that were just coming in and you were in
        charge of making sure that everything worked. That really was a good training
        for the Tour; the Tour really is a piece of cake compared to that. I\u2019m
        just getting kind of old and lazy, but back in those days, I would have to
        get up before everybody else, get the coffee ready and start making breakfast,
        you know, under a ledge somewhere on the top of this mountain. And, you know,
        people would get sick; you were in charge of them, figuring out what to do
        with them, and it was incredible. It was fabulous. People had a great time.
        It was just a wonderful, and probably still is, an incredible place in the
        world. I started doing that in \u201984, and then for about ten years\u2014until
        about \u201994\u2014I was doing that once or twice or three times a year.
        And that had a big effect on the pots. I didn\u2019t think that it would have
        much of an effect because you\u2019re taking maybe two, three months off;
        the rest of the year you\u2019re making pots. But I didn\u2019t know how else
        to deal with that because I was getting paid in dollars to do that and then,
        at the exchange rate, that was a lot of money, so it was a significant way
        of making some additional income. But during that time, instead of remaining
        in the same place as far as your work is concerned, you lose the momentum,
        and you lose the ideas that you are working with, and when you come back to
        it, you kind of backslide, and you have to try to start thinking about, What
        was I doing? Basically, a lot of things go by the wayside and you never really
        get back to them because you kind of lose them. For those people who feel
        that they need to have another day job in order to support their pottery,
        I think it has a big effect. There\u2019s no way that you can avoid it having
        a big effect, and it did for a long time.\nBut I kept doing that, and then
        when Venezuela started going down the tubes, my friend Terry took me down
        to Patagonia and trained me up down there, and so I started guiding for Wilderness
        Travel in Patagonia in Argentina and Chile. And then my mom moved to Peru,
        so I was able to get myself into leading trips on the Inca Trail: Machu Picchu
        and Cuzco and that sort of thing. So I did that for a few years. And I did
        that for a few years after I moved to the U.S. Well, 2008, you know, when
        the market kind of tanked, a lot of these trips began to really slow down,
        and Wilderness Travel has a lot of guides that are in place\u2014like in Cuzco
        in Peru, there are three Wilderness Travel guides that live there\u2014so
        they were able to handle all of the remaining trips; so I was not getting
        work anymore. But there was so much work happening here, with the pottery,
        that it was almost a relief, you know? I was able just to stay focused on
        making pots. I\u2019m really happy not to be leading trips anymore. It was
        a lot of fun\u2014I\u2019ve taken some friends, I\u2019ve taken some potters,
        on trips; I\u2019d love to do that: trips that I design and that are going
        to focus on the things that I\u2019m interested in, creative things: textiles
        and ceramics and food. I mean, what could be better?\n02:04:12\nAW: Well,
        I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve come back to Venezuela because I\u2019m curious,
        in the early part of your career, what kinds of influences came out of Venezuela
        or came out of some of the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n31\ncommunities
        that you were meeting through these travels? Would you say that there were
        certain artistic or cultural influences that were in your pottery?\nGC: Very,
        kind of vague, really. The Indians definitely had an effect\u2014their work.
        I make some big platters that are almost a literal representation of a basket;
        I try to give them a texture that looks like it. I also have some kind of
        feeling that I try to put into my pots that relates to\u2014but it\u2019s
        mostly the intention, you know, the way that the Indians related to their
        work. There weren\u2019t any real sources of influence or inspiration or whatever
        you call that in contemporary Venezuelan work. Not really for me. It was mostly
        that native stuff.\nAW: What about being outside and doing the guiding and
        going to some really incredible natural resources like Angel Falls or places
        like that\u2014plus just exploring around\u2014what did that mean for you?
        You\u2019ve also said that, here, the context of this environment is important
        for the Tour, so did the context of getting out and traveling around, did
        that also influence you?\nGC: Nature\u2014well, I don\u2019t know if it was
        influence, but it was something that just was very important to me, and very
        moving. You know, diving, coral reefs, that sort of thing, blow your mind.
        I mean, the richness of the color in that sort of experience is fantastic.
        And we got into birds: Laurie and I were involved with the Audubon Society
        in Venezuela, and we led bird trips and stuff like that. Venezuela has almost
        twice as many birds as the continental United States, and Venezuela is a country
        the size of Texas maybe. The Amazon, the richness and diversity of the tropical
        environments, it\u2019s just incredible. So birding was really just\u2014these
        crazy things, these birds like the ones you see on the television, they were
        just \u201cWho invented that?\u201d sort of thing. And the same with the insect
        life.\nSo when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life, I did this
        little book thing that kind of helps you go through and try to focus on what
        it is that\u2019s important to you. Art and nature were basically the two.
        Any spirituality was sort of like an extension of nature to me. It was those
        three things, but art and nature really were the two central elements that
        were most important to me. I don\u2019t know how that effects my work except
        that I want my pots to look like they really are clay. I talked to a very
        good friend of mine who\u2019s a designer, and he said, \u201cIt doesn''t
        matter what the material is, you know, it\u2019s the design. You can use concrete,
        you can use wood, you can use plastic, anything\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter.
        It\u2019s the design.\u201d And that\u2019s a designer talking, but I can\u2019t
        feel that way. I want the nature of the material itself to come through, and
        it\u2019s that dialogue between my intentions to impose my will on it and
        its reluctance to accept\u2014that little tension in there, I think, is really
        important. One thing that I try to do very often\u2014well, different kinds
        of techniques, but\u2014I try to make my pots look old. Even when they\u2019re
        coming fresh out of the kiln, I want them to look like somebody dug \u2019em
        up or it\u2019s a found object or something like that. I don\u2019t want them
        to look bright, shiny, and new. Those (gestures to cups) have a slip underneath
        them that crackles, and then the glaze fills the crackle over, but it looks
        kind of like old, cracked leather. Maybe these don\u2019t show it so much
        because it was thin, but there are other pots where it shows better. There\u2019s
        another technique that\u2019s salt firing or soda firing, which is a new kiln
        that I\u2019m starting to fire now. It\u2019s an old technique, it\u2019s
        a medieval European technique, of throwing salt into a kiln when it\u2019s
        hot, and the salt vaporizes and the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n32\nsodium coats everything and it glazes everything\u2014you
        know those old, grey, salt beer steins? Those are traditionally salt-glaze.
        I like to use those just to give the pots a timeless kind of a thing\u2014it\u2019s
        not like they\u2019re new right now.\n02:10:38\nAW: Has your work changed
        since coming to St. Croix?\nGC: Yeah, I think it has. Part of it has to do
        with actually making a lot of pots. I\u2019ve been working full time, pretty
        much\u2014I did some trips, and I have gone back to see my mom, and I\u2019ve
        done some workshops\u2014but since I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve had an average
        of one firing a month. So that\u2019s 220, 250, pots a month, which would
        be 3,000 pots a year. Just that continuous work has been incredible. Also,
        being here, I\u2019m not just imagining the pots that all these other potters
        are making that I admire, but I\u2019m actually walking around and seeing
        them, so there\u2019s a real interaction. It\u2019s enriching to have that
        interaction with other people, and see everybody\u2019s pots. Go down to the
        Northern Clay Center, and there\u2019s shows; the old stuff at the MIA, you
        know? So, yeah, it\u2019s been really enriching to be in the middle of all
        this stuff that\u2019s really happening\u2014the pots themselves. In Venezuela,
        I felt a little isolated, like I didn\u2019t really have an opportunity to
        see a lot of stuff. I\u2019d read magazines, and wait and hope for the next
        magazine to come out and be able to see a few pictures of some pots that people
        were making. Here, Minnesota is one of the richest areas of ceramics\u2014it\u2019s
        an extremely rich area of ceramics\u2014in the whole world, really, so there\u2019s
        a lot of stuff to see.\nAW: And why is that, do you think?\nGC: I think Warren
        probably had something to do with it. I wasn\u2019t here, and I don\u2019t
        feel totally entitled to be so certain about things, but it seems to me that
        Warren came here, and there wasn''t much here when he came. He started making
        pots and pushing pots and doing demos and teaching and, eventually, working
        at the university and having really talented people get excited about pots.
        And people like Mark Pharis, who became a professor at the University of Minnesota,
        and all of these people\u2014Randy Johnson\u2019s teaching at the university
        in River Falls\u2014so many of these people have been teaching and have had
        students that have infused this are with that enthusiasm for clay to be a
        valid creative expression. So I think it\u2019s snowballed. And then there\u2019s
        this incredibly supportive community: all of these people that have learned
        to love pots. They turn out, you know. You were here on Friday, and Friday
        was a miserable day, and people come out. They\u2019re not going to be put
        off by a little weather. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\n02:15:18\nAW: Just
        curious: how has weather influenced the Tour, or not?\nGC: It\u2019s always
        a reason for a little bit of anxiety because another thing that we do is we
        have all the pots outside. I don\u2019t want to have a bunch of tents. The
        pots look so good out in the sunshine, or even if it\u2019s cloudy, they look
        just wonderful if they\u2019re outside in natural light. This year, we A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n33\nbought a bunch of
        umbrellas; we had several dozen umbrellas out there for people to use if they
        needed them. But it hasn\u2019t forced us yet to change. The scariest thing
        that happened this year was when Laurie started talking about hail. What happens
        if there\u2019s hail, and you\u2019ve got several thousand pots out there?
        How quickly can you put them under the surfaces?\nAW: It\u2019s true! (Laughing)
        Maybe snow is not the biggest threat\u2014\nGC: \u2014I wonder if I should
        look into some insurance. (Laughs) Hail damage on the pots!\nAW: Hail damage
        for outdoor art shows, I wonder.\nGC: Because it would be a really significant
        hit. Really. But let\u2019s not dwell on that too much.\nAW: Hopefully next
        one will be warm and sunny.\nGC: You know, the first three years, when I was
        a guest at Linda\u2019s, it was always wet, miserable, and cold. And then
        the first couple of years that I did it here, it was wet, miserable, and cold.
        Then, I think it was three years ago, we had this fabulous, wonderful, warm,
        beautiful [weather], and people wouldn\u2019t leave. We ran out of food\u2014we
        had to run down to Costco real quick (Laughs) because people were just hanging
        out. It was great, it was wonderful. It\u2019s really nice when it can be
        nice weather. And I do think about it. We put up some tents so that people
        can find a place to stand under if it\u2019s rainy. The wind is always a concern
        because sometimes you have to stand there and hang onto the tents because
        they want to pick up and fly away. But I\u2019m not sure how to resolve that
        yet.\nAW: For all of the people coming through, it would be really hard to
        have it all inside. That\u2019s what makes it fun is having it outside and
        walking around the area and being part of that natural environment and just
        soaking it up.\nGC: One of the things that we did that I mentioned at the
        beginning and we haven\u2019t talked about any further is that we were able
        to buy this lot next door. It\u2019s all flat and open. It\u2019s a beautiful,
        beautiful spot over there with a view over to Wisconsin and the bluffs over
        the river, and I have these fantasies that the Tour could happen over there,
        and I\u2019m not sure. Maybe just having a big roof, and then setting up just
        around the roof so that people could have everything like the food and the
        checkout and sitting area and everything like that under the roof, but the
        pots are all just outside so you don\u2019t have to go very far out to see
        them. But I think that\u2019s fantasy.\nAW: Are there repeat guests who keep
        coming back? Can you give examples of people you\u2019ve gotten to know over
        the years?\nGC: Oh, yeah. Well, there\u2019s a family\u2014the young woman,
        her name is Jade Pinz, and her husband Michael, and I think it\u2019s her
        parents and the kids\u2014they\u2019ve been coming since the first sales we\u2019ve
        had here. They\u2019re really representative, I think, because they\u2019ve
        become sort of expected; if they didn\u2019t come, I\u2019d be worried that
        something happened. But yeah, there\u2019s always A Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n34\na lot of repeat people that come, and
        it\u2019s really nice. Of course, it\u2019s also really nice when people come
        that are new. When we did our fall sale last year with this ArtReach promotion,
        we got a bunch of people that I could see that they\u2019d never been to a
        pottery sale before, and they didn''t really know what it was about, and they
        saw that there was some food there, but they didn\u2019t know, Who did they
        have to pay? It was really nice to have all of these new people come and have
        the experience. One of the really greatest things about the Tour is having
        these conversations with people that you don\u2019t get to see very often.
        They\u2019re people that are busy or they have a different life, and so you
        know them from somewhere\u2014I met Steven Rosenstone, who\u2019s the chancellor
        of MNSCU\u2014he\u2019s whatever the director of MNSCU is\u2014and his wife
        is from Spain, so we have that, Spanish, in common. I met them through Warren,
        and I think she\u2019s made pots, so there\u2019s that interest. We were talking
        about the fact that we\u2019re asking people to use the pots, and he had this
        incredible insight that studies have been done and theories have been proposed,
        and I guess what people believe now is that there are two ways to try to change
        people\u2019s behavior: you can list all the reasons why their lives will
        be better if they do something differently, or you can just give them the
        experience and they will see the change, they will experience the change,
        and that will have a much, much greater effect than just saying, \u201cYou
        know, if you quit smoking, you\u2019re gonna feel better; you know, if you
        quit smoking, you\u2019re gonna be able to walk up and down the stairs and
        you won\u2019t get tired and your breath won\u2019t smell bad and, you know,
        people will like you better\u201d\u2014whatever it is that you want to convince
        people about. So I was thinking that this idea of giving people the food in
        pots instead of giving them the food in disposable paper stuff, it just fits
        perfectly: you\u2019re giving people the experience; this is what it\u2019s
        like. Then people come up to me and they say\u2014I actually had people come
        up and say, \u201cI went to the Brookside\u201d\u2014that restaurant where
        my son works (they use our pots there to serve their food)\u2014and she said,
        \u201cYou know, why don\u2019t I have something nice to eat on at my house?
        Why do I have to eat on these\u201d\u2014whatever it is that she had. Yeah,
        that whole idea of giving people the experience is just one of the really
        nice moments. You were talking about favorite moments, or one of the questions
        was about favorite moments\u2014that is one of my favorite moments. And like
        that, there have been many when there\u2019s just this communication with
        somebody and just this real nice insight into something.\n02:24:10\nAW: Are
        there other favorite moments or memories that come up for you?\nGC: Well,
        there\u2019s so many. Walter and Joan Mondale came out, you know? (Laughing)
        I wish my dad would have been around. Yes, then he might have accepted things
        a little better.\nAW: Did you have siblings; do you have siblings?\nGC: I
        had two siblings that were much later than I. My mom wasn\u2019t able to conceive
        easily, and once I was born she was not able to conceive any more, so they
        were both adopted. It took her a long time to make that decision. By the time
        they came around, I was almost out on my way, gone to school in the States
        and stuff. My brother is a composer, and he lives in New York City. A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n35\nAnd my sister lives
        in Venezuela. She\u2019s married, and she hasn\u2019t found a way to be able
        to make a life outside or to leave, so she\u2019s still living there.\nAW:
        So your brother also went into, well, music?\nGC: Well, yeah, it was like\u2014\nAW:
        \u2014So you paved the way, perhaps.\nGC: Yeah, but I think even more than
        I, he was into music from the time he was a little kid. That was going to
        be his thing; it was kind of obvious. And I don\u2019t know, maybe my parents
        also felt music was a little more respectable than playing with mud. (Laughs)\nAW:
        Has your mom come up here during the Tour?\nGC: She hasn\u2019t been during
        the Tour, but she used to be a big help in Venezuela when we did our sales
        there\u2014everybody got drafted to help preparing food and stuff\u2014but
        she\u2019s been here to visit. But she\u2019s 92 now; she\u2019s going to
        be 92 in June\u2014this month, the twenty-fifth. So it\u2019s a little harder
        for her to travel now, but she is talking about coming up again this year.\nAW:
        Okay. Now, can I ask, when you went to college, did you come on a student
        visa? How has that worked getting across the border? As an immigration historian,
        I\u2019m very interested in how policies affect people\u2019s lives. What
        has that been like for you?\nGC: Yeah, there is an interesting little twist
        in that story, and that is that I was here on a student visa, and I can\u2019t
        remember what that\u2019s called anymore\u2014\nAW: \u2014Ah, actually first
        in high school?\nGC: Yep. Even in high school, student visa, yep. All the
        way through college, but my last year in college, I got that government scholarship
        for a year. So I got something called an exchange visitor status: a J-1 was
        that status at the time. I don\u2019t know if it exists anymore because things
        have evolved. I mean, I had such a sweet treatment at the embassy; they were
        really, really very kind and nice and everything. When Laurie and I went back
        to Venezuela, as I said, we went back on vacation and we stayed for thirty
        years. We went back on vacation, and then after awhile I thought, You know,
        we\u2019d better get back on track and get doing something because otherwise
        we\u2019re going to just not have a scenario, a future, something\u2014this
        is before I got my job with the World Wildlife Fund. I decided I would try
        to go back to school in the United States and get a master\u2019s in something
        to do with environment. I thought environmental geology or something might
        be something that I could do since I had my geology major. I couldn''t get
        any money, so I would have to come to the U.S. and do some sort of work and
        figure it out. So in order to do that, I applied for residency, and that involved
        a number of steps, which you probably know: I had to get a letter from every
        police department from every town that I had lived in in the United States
        for more than six months saying that I didn\u2019t have any record, and I
        had to get all of these papers A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n36\ntogether,
        and we submitted the papers. Then, the day that they were going to give me
        the visa, the consul called me in, and she was on the verge of tears. She
        said, \u201cYou know, we didn\u2019t realize that you\u2019d had a J-1 visa
        your last year, and you can\u2019t get a residency until you\u2019ve lived
        in your home country for two years for every year that you\u2019ve had this
        exchange visitor visa. So I wasn\u2019t able to get the [residency]\u2014you
        know, we\u2019d been six months kind of dawdling, having a wonderful time
        but not really doing much and getting all these papers together, and then
        suddenly we weren\u2019t going; we weren\u2019t coming back; we weren\u2019t
        going to go back to school. That\u2019s one reason that I stayed in Venezuela.
        But then, when I applied after we\u2019d been married for thirty years, by
        then it was pretty obvious that I wasn\u2019t trying to get into the U.S.
        by marrying a U.S. citizen. So that worked out pretty quickly: green card,
        and then I actually got my citizenship maybe three or four years ago now.\n02:30:48\nAW:
        Oh, okay, so when did you arrive to permanently stay here?\nGC: The transition
        began mid 2005. We\u2019ve had so many kind of circumstantial things that
        happened that you wonder, What is it that makes those things happen? We got
        a letter from Laurie\u2019s friend from New Mexico, and she said, \u201cYou
        know, I hear all of this stuff, and things that are going on in Venezuela.
        Why don\u2019t you come and visit? We think New Mexico would be a great place
        for you guys. And by the way, we have a car we haven\u2019t been able to sell,
        and it\u2019s sitting here, and if you need a car, you can have it.\u201d
        You know, it was just kind of mind-boggling.\nAW: You said she was good friends
        with Laurie?\nGC: Yeah, very. Yeah, and we did go, and we did get the car.
        It was the best car I\u2019ve ever had; it was a Ford Explorer\u2014it was
        a wonderful car. But the other one was we got a letter from a friend of ours
        who had lived in Venezuela for a long time and then had married a university
        professor from Minnesota and was living in South Minneapolis, and he was going
        to go teach in China. So they were going to go to China for a year, and she
        said, \u201cYou know, with all the stuff that\u2019s going on and we\u2019re
        going to teach in China, and there\u2019s a house, it\u2019s here, and if
        you need a place and you want to stay\u201d and everything, so, just when
        we were thinking about, How do we get there?, Where do we go?, we got a house
        in a beautiful, beautiful place near Lake Harriett, I guess, near the Minnehaha
        Parkway. For us, coming from an urban situation in Caracas, which is kind
        of grim in many ways, and the Minnehaha Parkway? The kids would be inner tubing
        down this creek down the middle of the city, with their dogs and\u2014it was
        a heaven: go out for a run, go run around the lake, it was unbelievable. If
        I had to move back into a city, I\u2019m definitely moving into the Twin Cities.
        I\u2019m not going anywhere else. Great place to live.\nSo we were there until
        the end of 2005. We bought this and moved in over Christmas\/New Years, 2005-2006.
        And we spent over a year doing all of this\u2014we built an addition\u2014the
        showroom and the kiln room down here are all stuff that we put on there. Then,
        I had my first firing here in 2007. I worked at Warren\u2019s for awhile,
        commuting back and forth and making pots A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n37\nthere and having firings with him for the first year.
        And then built a kiln, had a firing, and it came out just in time to go to
        Linda\u2019s for the Tour in 2007.\nAW: Wow, you moved quickly when you got
        here. Why did you want to live here in the St. Croix area? When you were looking
        at where you were going to live in Minnesota, why the St. Croix area?\nGC:
        Well, where we lived in Venezuela was just a little too far away from the
        city, so people would come out for the events because it was a big party and
        there was a huge number of pots and food and people and stuff going on, but
        they wouldn\u2019t come out consistently, you know, every weekend, buy a few
        pots, and so there wasn\u2019t like a steady income. We had to always be looking
        for other ways to make ends meet. When I moved here, I was in my mid fifties,
        and I was thinking, I don\u2019t have the luxury right now of doing the New
        Mexico thing. I loved New Mexico: the food is awesome, the weather is great;
        Laurie was worried there\u2019s not enough water, and she\u2019s probably
        right. Water\u2019s really going to be an issue in New Mexico. But I was worried
        that there wasn\u2019t going to be a real audience there for my kind of pots.
        It\u2019s the Southwest, you know\u2014if people go there, they\u2019re looking
        for Maria Martinez or Native American stuff, not Asian-influenced, traditional
        stoneware pots. And I thought that I wanted to maybe play it safe in terms
        of finding a place where I could be close enough to an urban area. I would
        normally have preferred to be in a more remote place, and I would have preferred
        not to make an investment in such an expensive place\u2014because the mortgage
        is going to go on until I\u2019m in my mid eighties or so. (Laughs) I thought
        it would have been much nicer to be in a small place, out of the way, more
        remote, but I needed to get some place where people would come and buy pots.
        So that\u2019s one reason that this area appealed, and this particular house
        and this particular spot was really good.\nYeah, the first time when we moved
        out to the place where we lived [in Venezuela], it was just the kind of thing
        you could do when you had a huge amount of energy. \u2019Cause everything
        was uphill; there wasn\u2019t a flat spot on our property; everything was
        uphill or downhill, so every sack of cement, every sack of clay, every pot,
        every board\u2014everything had to be carried up and, most of the time, carried
        up a trail; there was no way to drive to there, my studio was maybe a hundred
        yards from where the car could get to. I didn''t want to repeat those things;
        I wanted to make it so that it was possible.\n02:37:44\nAW: I was just thinking
        of that photo you showed us of the view out your bedroom window\u2014how you
        had to have felt to have had that view.\nGC: It was glorious; it was wonderful.
        But we did have bats flying around, and it was living out in the tropical
        forest, where, one morning, the floor was covered with army ants. And they
        were just moving through, they didn\u2019t hurt anybody and they weren\u2019t
        looking for anybody to sting or anything, but they were always moving, and
        they happened to move through the house, and a couple hours later, there was
        not an ant to be found. But, you know, you get up, you\u2019re gonna have
        coffee, and the floor is moving. (Laughs) A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n38\nAW: Oh my God.\nGC: It was wonderful. It really was
        a beautiful, beautiful place. We grew coffee, so we used to roast coffee before
        our tour sales, and then we\u2019d sell coffee.\nWe even had a label. It was
        a sloth sitting in the tree branch with a cup of coffee, so it was Sloth Brand
        Coffee\u2014Caf\u00e9 la pereza. That was fun.\nAW: So coffee that could even
        wake up a sloth. (Laughs)\nGC: (Laughs)\nAW: I don\u2019t know if you could
        grow coffee out here, but there certainly seem to be more vineyards around
        here, so maybe there\u2019s a possible connection to be made between the wine
        cups and the vineyards here. I just noticed as we were driving around that
        it seems that\u2019s also really blossoming.\nGC: Yeah. Absolutely. That and
        beer.\nAW: Definitely the beer, too. So we\u2019ve gone through a lot of questions\u2014let
        me just take a look here\u2014\nGC: \u2014It\u2019s been more stream of consciousness
        than\u2014\nAW: \u2014You know, that\u2019s how it goes sometimes. I think
        that\u2019s great; you\u2019ve covered a lot even in your initial descriptions.
        Do you have any follow-up questions at the moment, Tierney?\nTM: No. Hearing
        about the immigration stuff is interesting because my aunt is from the Philippines,
        and she married my uncle and had to go through that process. It\u2019s interesting
        to hear what people go through to get a green card to stay here.\n02:40:23\nGC:
        Yeah, I have to say my experience with going from the green card to the citizenship
        was really sweet. I imagine that not everybody\u2019s had that kind of experience,
        but I went down to\u2014I don\u2019t even remember, I think it\u2019s Bloomington\u2014where
        the immigration services is\u2014\nTM: Yeah. I know where that is\u2014\nGC:
        \u2014And then the ceremony was really sweet. That judge was this fourth-generation
        Norwegian. (Laughs) But he was so kind and talked about how his family also
        had come in from another country. The place was full of people\u2014there
        were Somalis, there was a Peruvian woman. There was a Peruvian woman there
        who had worked as an assistant to my cousin, or my A Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n39\ncousin\u2019s husband, who was
        the mayor of a section, a department of the municipality of Lima\u2014Lima,
        Peru\u2014and she had worked for him, and they were good friends, and we happened
        to coincide to the same day to our citizenship ceremonies. Anyway, I didn\u2019t
        expect to be moved by that sort of thing because, you know, you think it\u2019s
        just kind of a bureaucracy thing\u2014it\u2019s not going to change how you
        feel about anything\u2014and it\u2019s not true. It was really a neat experience.
        And some of Laurie\u2019s family was there, too, so that was nice. Linda Christiansen
        was there, too.\nAW: What did you find moving about it?\nGC: Well, it really
        does give you a sense of being part of something, being accepted into a society.
        At this point, it\u2019s hard to\u2014I\u2019d have to think about it a little
        bit more. I know I talked about it before.\nAW: Did you have to give up your
        Venezuelan citizenship?\nGC: It isn\u2019t a requirement. I think it used
        to be; you have to swear you\u2019re not going to have any loyalty to any
        other monarchs or governments or\u2014(chuckles) that\u2019s all to be expected
        and all. I guess being in a room with a bunch of people, and all of these
        people were moved\u2014I mean, all of these people were just so happy\u2014and
        I\u2019m pretty clear-eyed about problems in the U.S. and problems with inequality
        of resources and problems of inequality of people\u2019s education whether
        they\u2019re from different economic or racial or cultural classes, but my
        sense about everybody in that room was that they felt they had achieved a
        standing in a land where there was opportunity\u2014that they were actually
        going to be able to make a life, and, you know, it\u2019s certainly been the
        case for me. I realize I\u2019m privileged because I have all kinds of friends
        and networks and connections, and I speak the language, and some of these
        people, they\u2019re coming without any of that, and still, you know, they
        were there. You could just get that sense of how they were looking to a better
        future.\n02:45:12\nAW: When you first came over, when you guys moved back
        from Venezuela and moved to Minnesota, did you have a sense of identity as
        an immigrant, or not at all?\nGC: I think I did. Yeah.\nAW: You had traveled
        back and forth so much\u2014kind of on a regular basis almost\u2014coming
        up for the summers.\nGC: Yeah, but I was going back. And always kind of attaching
        myself to a different reality. But my parents were immigrants in Venezuela,
        too. My dad always felt a little bit like he wasn\u2019t really accepted because
        he was Colombian\u2014always neighboring countries have this thing going on.
        So I think they never felt real accepted in Venezuela. Well, my dad definitely
        was a social animal, so he knew everybody and everybody knew him and a lot
        of people respected him. My A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n40\nmom
        wasn\u2019t really able to\u2014she was always thinking she was going to move
        back to Peru. I guess that affected me in the sense that I felt like I wasn\u2019t
        really, totally Venezuelan either.\nAW: What did you kind of consider yourself
        when growing up there?\nGC: There were so many foreigners in Venezuela\u2014we
        all grew up speaking Spanglish. Those people have gone on to live all over
        the world, and I don\u2019t know how they feel. Some of them say it was too
        bad not to have that sense of having a real place, you know? Laurie grew up
        in Mason City, and there\u2019s no doubt, to her, that\u2019s [home] ground.\nAW:
        That\u2019s home, home town?\nGC: Yeah.\nAW: And you were saying you didn\u2019t
        really have that sense of fitting\u2014\nGC: \u2014Not really.\nAW: Well,
        you left pretty young; you were in high school.\nGC: I left pretty young,
        yeah. Fifteen.\nAW: What was your first impression of the U.S.?\nGC: Well,
        it was all pretty weird. I went to a school in Wisconsin for two years. They
        came to recruit to Venezuela, and they went to this international school that
        I went to, and they made some sort of deal. And at the time Venezuela was
        riding high, and the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar was pegged to the dollar at a
        very favorable rate, so it was affordable for my parents to send me to this
        school. And I got all kinds of help from the school. But I think what they
        were looking for is I think they were looking to try to diversify a little,
        to desegregate. Racism was pretty rampant. It was pretty amazing. I mean,
        I didn\u2019t bear any brunt of much of anything because I don\u2019t look
        so different, and I could speak English. But I saw things you wouldn\u2019t,
        you know\u2014like with black musicians that would be invited to come\u2014Muddy
        Waters. I mean, it was a good school\u2014Kohlers, Mayers (Oscar Mayer, the
        wieners)\u2014that was the kind of people that went to school there. So it
        was very weird.\nAW: So was this close in Wisconsin?\nGC: I don\u2019t know:
        Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. I have no idea where it is; I\u2019d have to look it
        up on the map. But I used to go from Chicago on the train. That was cool,
        that was really neat. There were really a lot of very sweet, very nice people,
        but that was really kind of an experience, not having a clue, you know, how
        to\u2014 (Laughs)\n02:50:02 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n41\nAW:
        (Laughs)\nGC: Yeah, we don\u2019t want to get started with the stories.\nAW:
        Well, just some context: where you were growing up and going to school in
        Venezuela, was there a real mix of people from all over the world?\nGC: Absolutely.
        Yeah. Yeah.\nAW: Was there racism there, too?\nGC: Yeah.\nAW: How did that
        operate similarly or differently from racism in the U.S.?\nGC: I can remember
        some cases of it as being even uglier. There were kids that were Black American
        kids going to school there\u2014not many, one or two\u2014and the people that
        were in Venezuela weren\u2019t necessarily highly educated or sophisticated;
        they were people that were maybe highly qualified to work in the oil industry
        or support industries that are around the oil industry. But they were not
        necessarily your enlightened, liberal, whatever, kind of people\u2014there
        was all kinds of people. Some really wonderful\u2014you know, it was the real
        world; there was everything.\nBut, yeah, that first experience was kind of
        interesting. And from there, my parents thought I was having too good a time
        there because that was a co-ed school, so then I went to Massachusetts and
        I went for two years to a school that was all boys, which is now co-ed. Williston
        Academy. That was in Easthampton, Massachusetts, but it was even much more
        sort of wild and radical than this co-ed school had been. But it was good.\nAW:
        Yeah, you had mentioned that a little bit earlier; I was hoping to hear just
        a little bit more what you meant. When you said you got involved in some of
        the issues of the time\u2014this was the mid to late \u201960s\u2014what did
        that mean for you? What kinds of things were you passionate about then?\nGC:
        Well, I wasn\u2019t finding anyone in the school who was turning me on to
        any learning, but there was a social environment there that was kind of interesting
        politically. Then, of course, I was seventeen or eighteen, and no girls at
        the school\u2014there was Northampton School for Girls, there was Smith College\u2014and
        you\u2019re trying to figure out how to connect with the opposite sex at some
        point somehow, so that was kind of basically the first thing in your list
        of priorities of what to do, but the day of the moratorium, all of the students
        decided that they were going to march from Easthampton\/Northampton down the
        middle of the road, which is about a seven mile walk, and have the whole student
        body do that. Then, the headmaster of the school decided that he was going
        to lead the march. It was like, \u201cWow, that was pretty wild.\u201d And
        there were all kinds of A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n42\nthings
        going on; it was the times. There was the University of Massachusetts, James
        Taylor giving a concert and people jumping on stage and putting a joint to
        his mouth so that he could have a hit while he was playing. So drugs were
        a part of the scene. And I was pretty much ready to go somewhere and find
        something. It wasn\u2019t the best time in my life. So going to Iowa really
        actually turned out to be really nice.\nAW: Was it a big transition from the
        social environment you were experiencing in Massachusetts to go to Cornell
        in Iowa? Or did you find similar\u2014\nGC: \u2014There were some similarities.
        It was still the same time, so there was a lot of the same stuff going on.\n02:55:20\nAW:
        Did you see a difference between the East Coast and Midwest approach to those
        issues going on at the time?\nGC: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting. Yeah, I think
        so. I remember hitchhiking a lot when I was in Massachusetts, and I got a
        ride with this sweet little old lady, and when she started talking about Nixon,
        it was almost scary, you know? She was really mad and hateful; I didn\u2019t
        ever see that sort of thing in Iowa. People might have been objecting just
        as much to the war, but it wasn\u2019t quite as radical, I think, as Massachusetts
        was.\nTM: Massachusetts is hardly known for their subtlety.\nGC: (Laughs)
        Yeah. Yeah.\nAW: Did you get involved in political activism when you were
        at Cornell?\nGC: Not so much. There was a dorm where there were some fraternities\u2014they
        were called \u201csocial groups\u201d because fraternities weren\u2019t allowed,
        but they were fraternities\u2014and then there was what they called the G-D-Is\u2014the
        GodDamned Independents\u2014and I was one of those. We lived in one dorm,
        and we were all the weirdos. I just kind of gravitated towards that and doing
        things\u2014mostly, I was so much into pots. And then when I was gone for
        two years and came back, I lived off campus. When I lived off campus, I shared
        an apartment with friends. So it was all about learning to live on your own
        and cooking and, you know, we didn\u2019t do a lot of camping, but nature
        was still big, whole wheat, soybeans, learning to cook vegetarian, brown rice\u2014all
        of that sort of thing. And the relationship between that and the pots and
        all, I think that was really what was central.\nAW: I had a follow-up question
        and then we\u2019ll get to some reflective questions; I realize we\u2019ve
        taken up a lot of your time\u2014\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG.
        Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n43\nGC: Well, I\u2019m happy, but I hope that some of
        this is useful. But does it get edited? Because nobody\u2019s going to sit
        and listen to this! (Laughs)\nAW: They might, they might.\nTM: You\u2019d
        be surprised.\nAW: I mean, historians of art, historians of ceramics, historians
        of Minnesota\u2014this could speak to a number of people who are interested.\nAW:
        We\u2019ve talked about moving in and out of all these cultures and places,
        so a follow up question on when you were working with Indians and setting
        up those guiding tours: how did you decide which connections with them [to
        make]? How did you negotiate these trips? What was that like, moving into
        those other areas of Venezuela?\nGC: Well, the Indians had had contact with
        people for a long time. The mountain that we used to climb up was called Roraima\u2014it\u2019s
        on the intersection of Venezuela, Guyana, and Brazil\u2014and it was called
        the Crystal Mountain by Sir Walter Raleigh, who walked through there, and
        then Conan Doyle based the book Journey to the Lost World on that mountain.
        He\u2019d been by there, too. So we weren\u2019t anything like the first people
        to go there. But when we first went, with Laurie and another two friends of
        ours, the Indians didn\u2019t want to deal with us. We actually went and climbed
        up the mountain on our own, and didn''t do very much on top because it\u2019s
        pretty easy to get lost; it\u2019s all full of cracked rocks and stuff like
        that. But then, a few years later, friends of ours had been there and had
        contact with one particular Indian, and they\u2019d kind of made friends with
        him, and these guys are always desperate for help for something or other,
        so there had been a couple of projects like taking PVC\u2014rolls of pipe\u2014to
        get water down from this little spring up here and bring it into the village
        so that they wouldn\u2019t have to go from the village out to other places
        to get water. That relationship began, and then when we started bringing people,
        they realized that they were making a lot of money by doing this. And, of
        course, that generated a certain amount of issues within the community. They
        are very much a community, and so they made a sort of cooperative arrangement
        where there\u2019s a number of guys that work, so everybody gets a turn: the
        next group that comes in, you get those guys. We had a really good working
        relationship and I would even say a friendship with one guy, two guys\u2014first
        one, then another: Carmelo was real smart\u2014very little man, very smart,
        very concerned with making things work and work well. They have evolved now;
        they really run the show now. Now if you want to go there, you have to go
        there and you have to set up the trip with them. You can only be on the top
        for one day because there\u2019re more groups coming, there\u2019s very few
        places to camp, they limit the places that people camp, they make sure that
        people don\u2019t leave garbage, you know. They\u2019re taking care of their
        mountain, which is great. It used to be that we used to pay them for every
        bag of garbage that they brought out because I\u2019d catch them stuffing
        garbage under a rock\u2014because, I mean, you have to carry the stuff, and
        it\u2019s heavy, and you\u2019ve gotta walk for two days with this garbage,
        and then what are you gonna do? You\u2019re gonna throw it behind your house
        anyway. So yeah, it was an evolving relationship. I hope they\u2019re doing
        well now; I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t been there for years. A Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n44\n03:02:36\nAW: Thank
        you \u2013 I was just noticing this pattern of you going in and working with
        communities from such diverse places, and it seems like you\u2019re able to
        strike up friendships and connections and make things work with people. You\u2019ve
        traveled all around, and you\u2019ve been part of all these different places.
        I thought that was just interesting to see. And same thing happened when you
        moved here: you\u2019ve established friendships here, too, in Minnesota, and
        connections.\nGC: Yeah. I\u2019ve been lucky\u2014Yeah. Yeah. I guess so.\nAW:
        You mentioned, when you were first starting the Tour, some kind of subtle
        cultural expectations that maybe you weren\u2019t aware of; do you have just
        a couple of examples of what those little things were that you were noticing?\nGC:
        I was afraid you might ask. (Laughs)\nAW: You don\u2019t have to share them
        if you don''t want to. I think it just helps to know, what are some of those?\nGC:
        I\u2019m trying to think of something that\u2019s clear and that makes the
        point. It\u2019s just hard to\u2014this is really dumb, but this is one: for
        example, in Venezuela, if you\u2019re driving behind somebody and they\u2019re
        driving slower than you want to go, you tailgate in order to indicate to them
        that you\u2019re going to pass. So you\u2019re really riding this guy, and
        they notice, and then eventually\u2014you know, nobody\u2019s being very helpful
        here, you know\u2014but eventually if they get bored with having you riding
        on their tail, they may give you the opportunity to pass. Well you wouldn\u2019t
        want to do that here. It\u2019s that kind of thing. That\u2019s a very kind
        blatant [one], you know\u2014I know that. That isn\u2019t the kind of subtleties
        I\u2019m thinking of. But there are situations where there are some expectations:
        people send cards a lot here, you know? Like a thank you card for doing anything.
        I get thank you cards for stuff. I get thank you cards from the group of students
        that came and I showed them around during the Tour. You know, that\u2019s
        very sweet. In Venezuela, the mail doesn\u2019t work. We never sent invitations
        to our Encuentro by mail. We would divide a phone list\u2014we had telephone
        numbers of all of our people, and we would divide those phone numbers among
        the ten of us, and then every person would have fifty phone calls to make.
        And we never hit on the idea of the phone tree. (Laughs) This year, I sent
        cards to the people who worked here as volunteers, and it was for the first
        time. It was kind of like, \u201cOh! I know: we gotta send cards. That\u2019s
        what you do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d People here, at least in many cases around
        here, they don\u2019t interrupt much. In Latin America, you can\u2019t get
        a whole sentence out without somebody coming in and picking up. It\u2019s
        not rude; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re either agreeing or disagreeing,
        or adding information, or excited about because it\u2019s something. Here
        I have to hold myself back when we have our potters\u2019 meeting and I want
        to tell everybody about the Tour and somebody starts talking, and you have
        to sit and wait until they\u2019re done making their point. And they do have
        a point, and they get to it, eventually. That\u2019s a small, but real\u2014you
        don\u2019t want to offend people, and that\u2019s not the intention, but sometimes\u2014
        A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nG. Cuellar\n06\/02\/14\n45\n03:07:08\nAW:
        Well, and sometimes those small things make a difference, you know: gestures,
        or how people talk, how they converse, things like that. So thank you for
        telling us about those. I think those are important; that\u2019s all part
        of negotiating a place for oneself, or making a place a home, I think, is
        figuring those things out. I bet all those people in the room with you during
        that citizenship ceremony would probably have a whole list of moments just
        like that. (Chuckles)\nGC: (Laughing) \u201cYou know what happened to me?!\u201d\nAW:
        Yeah, getting to know Minnesota culture. Even though it is made up of people
        from all over the world, it really is a changing, dynamic thing, still. Newcomers
        to Minnesota all observe these kinds of things.\nTM: My hand still hurts from
        filling out thank you cards from my graduation party. I wrote out like two
        hundred of those. (Sighing) Oh!\nGC: (Laughs)\nAW: It\u2019s true.\nTM: My
        mom was just sitting right there making sure I filled out every single one
        a different way.\nGC: You know, it\u2019s just so different. For example,
        where we used to live in Turgua, there was no landline; there was no phone.
        Literally, for the first part of the time that we lived there, there was no
        telephone at all. One time, Laurie never got home, and I had to get in the
        car and drive in, and as I was halfway in my brother was halfway out to meet
        me to tell me that she\u2019d had an accident\u2014that everything was fine\u2014but
        there was no way to get that information to me because there was no telephone.
        And then suddenly, there were cell phones. So we went from no phones to, if
        I walked to the top of the mountain, I could use my cell phone and get a phone
        call and actually communicate. And I always had these conversations with Warren.
        Warren\u2014well, he always laughed at people that had cell phones. He thought,

        00:00:00\nAW: This is Andy Wilhide interviewing Janet Koplos on August 20,
        2014, in St. Paul,\nMinnesota at her home at 987 Como Boulevard East in St.
        Paul, 55103. This interview is for the\n\u201cA Measure of the Earth: An Oral
        History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,\u201d made\npossible
        by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Janet, thank you
        for agreeing\nto be interviewed and why don\u2019t we get started? First if
        you could tell us when and where were\nyou born?\nJK: Oh you don\u2019t need
        that! I\u2019m just a commentator on this. I don\u2019t want to talk about
        myself.\nAW: Can you tell us where you are from?\nJK: Well I have a very smart
        aleck answer to where I grew up \u2013 I grew up in New York in 1993\nwhen
        I got divorced. Haha! I shouldn\u2019t have recorded that, should I?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n2\nAnyway, the significant
        things are that I married a guy who was from Minnesota. We lived\nelsewhere,
        but we came back to Minnesota because he wanted to be here with his family
        so I\nended up graduating from the University of Minnesota with a degree in
        journalism. My first job\nafter journalism school was working for the Minnesota
        Crafts Council as the editor of their\nquarterly publication, which was called
        Craft Connection. When I was still at the University I\ntook part in a special
        class that you were selected to be in and we produced a one-shot magazine.\nIt
        happened to be 1976, the bi-centennial year, and so we chose as our topic
        the crafts revival.\nWe produced a little black and white magazine called
        Crafts in Minnesota. I had nothing to do\nwith that choice; I was not in the
        arts at that time. It was completely random. But the professor\nwho was running
        the class invited Warren MacKenzie to visit the class and give us some leads\non
        people to start to talk to and work it out from there to decide what would
        be in the magazine.\nThat was my first exposure to Warren, which turned out
        to be a kind of pivotal encounter.\nSubsequent to that magazine class, I applied
        to the Minnesota Daily, the college newspaper, to be\na theater critic, because
        I was a double major in journalism and theater. They did not need a\ntheater
        critic; they needed somebody to write about art. And I could not believe it
        because there\nwas studio art and art history there. Why didn\u2019t they
        have a qualified person to do the reporting\non this? They looked at my resume,
        such as it was, and were like \u201coh, you did this magazine\nabout crafts.
        You can write for us about art!\u201d And I thought, no, no I can\u2019t!
        I don\u2019t know\nanything about art! But I did end up doing little journalistic
        reports on things that were\nhappening. And little by little ever since then
        I\u2019ve been an art writer or reviewer or critic\ndepending upon what you
        want to call it. But the first person I published an interview with in the\nDaily
        was Warren. I had already met him and I just thought that would be an interesting
        place to\nstart. So again, this stuff keeps coming back to me.\nThe other
        people in the pottery tour--I did know Jeff Oestreich back in those days and
        I knew\nConnee Mayeron. Guillermo [Cuellar] wasn\u2019t here yet, and I don\u2019t
        think Bob [Briscoe] was\neither. I knew Linda [Christianson] by name and Janel
        [Jacobson] and Will [Swanson] by name\nbut not in person. So that is the deep
        history of my knowledge of ceramics in Minnesota.\nAW: When did you move to
        Minnesota, the first time?\nJK: Let\u2019s see, I think 1972 [actually 1969].\nAW:
        And you had been in New York before that? Or other parts of the U.S.?\nJK:
        Yes. I was born in California and my father was career army and so we lived
        all over the\nplace. Alaska, Oregon, Washington. I graduated from high school
        in Seattle. Met the Minnesota\nguy in Indiana. So just all over the place.\nAW:
        Can you tell us some of your first impressions when you moved here in 1972?
        What was\nthe scene like and what did you think?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n3\n00:05:00\nJK: It was all so new to me
        then so I didn\u2019t know what to think [Narrator\u2019s note: I was not\ninvolved
        in the arts. This answer relates to the time of journalism school, and thereafter,
        1976\nand on]. I took everything at face value. I had no basis for comparing
        to anything else or\nknowing what made Minnesota different from any other
        place. It was just, that was what was\nhere. So I did begin to expand out
        from that point, I would hear about people and places through\nediting the
        publication. It increased my knowledge.\nAW: Did you live in Minneapolis at
        that time?\nJK: In Minneapolis at that time and then Golden Valley, on the
        south side of Minneapolis. I\u2019m\njust trying to think if there is anything
        I can say about what I thought at that time.\nAW: Can I ask what neighborhood
        you were in?\nJK: We were near Lake Harriet, Garfield Avenue and then Queen.\nI
        was just trying to see if I can make some sort of analysis about what the
        craft field was like at\nthat time. There were certainly a lot of things going
        on. There were far more galleries here at that\ntime than there are now, both
        art galleries and specifically craft galleries. There was a place\ncalled
        Sontag Gallery in St. Paul that was on Grand Avenue in a house and it was
        run by a\nwoman named Fran Sontag and she was, well, I don\u2019t know what
        happened to her, we haven\u2019t\nstayed in touch, but she was sort of a mentor.
        She would tell me about things and explain the\ncontext of what I was seeing
        there [in the Sontag Gallery]. It was quite nice as I was new to all\nthese
        things. I just listened to what everybody told me.\nI don\u2019t know if this
        is really relevant, but there was also a woman named Shirley Johnson and\nshe
        was a potter who was Warren\u2019s friend, or domestic partner or studio mate,
        I\u2019m not sure.\nSomehow or another she and Warren were involved. I met
        her through Warren. And she had\nbeen a college English professor who became
        a full time potter. She used to teach at Northern\nClay [Center] once it came
        into existence. But she was also a mentor, both in writing and in\nknowing
        about what was going on in the field. I remember specifically one time I needed
        to\nwrite about a show at the Rochester Arts Center, and I simply walked in
        and looked at the stuff\nand thought, I don\u2019t know what to say. And Shirley
        said very calmly, \u201cWell, what do you see?\u201d\nso I said, \u201cWell
        there are these things on the wall\u201d and I started to describe what I
        saw. Since\nthen I\u2019ve told other people who are getting into writing
        this. It\u2019s wonderful advice. \u201cWhat do you\nsee?\u201d Just the basic
        thing of what\u2019s there. So all the years I subsequently lived other places
        \u2013\nIllinois, Atlanta, Tokyo for four years, and then in the New York
        City area for twenty some\nyears. I\u2019ve always had this warm spot in my
        heart for Minnesota because this is where it all\nbegan, and people were good
        to me. My ex-husband always had family here, so we came back\noccasionally
        and then I could renew my acquaintance with people from that time.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n4\nAW: And, what was it
        about writing about craft and art that interested you? Because you said it\nwasn\u2019t
        something that you set out to do but kind of fell into your lap. What kept
        you going that\nyou were interested in?\n00:09:30\nJK: I should say first
        that my wanting to be a theater critic was an unrealistic expectation because\nI
        have a hereditary hearing loss. It runs in my family. Two of my three siblings
        have it as well.\nSo I could not have gone on in that. I would not have been
        able to pursue that professionally. I\ndidn\u2019t realize that at the time.
        When I started writing about art I was just learning about editing\nas a field.
        I also had another editing job at the time editing the program magazine at
        Orchestra\nHall. And I knew nothing about music either. So these were just
        two new subject matters and I\njust had to worry about the language and the
        production of the magazine, the journalistic\nfunctions in both cases, but
        I did learn vastly more about the subjects. I think art spoke to me in\npart
        because it was a visual language. I think because my hearing is not good I
        look for visual\nclues. So I\u2019m looking at art in the same way I\u2019m
        trying to see visually if I don\u2019t quite hear\nsomething. It\u2019s a
        parallel kind of activity. So what interests me most is not doing the scholarly\nthing
        and writing the definitive paper on a major figure in the field or some sort
        of deep history.\nFor a long, long time I did not call myself an art historian.
        Even now it\u2019s a little dicey. Where\nwas I going there?\nMy favorite
        thing to do is to just encounter a work and to figure out what it says to
        me visually.\nThat made crafts interesting to me, because they were underrepresented,
        underwritten about.\nThere was this constant complaint that we need a language
        of criticism for crafts, which I\u2019ve\nnever really felt was true. I think
        our ordinary, everyday language just needs to be applied to this\nmaterial.
        So I\u2019m interested in the underdog. And it was an underdog field. So that\u2019s
        what I was\ngetting at. I didn\u2019t want to write the definite piece. I
        liked discovering something, and this was an\nopportunity for discovery. Just
        lately, the last two years or so, there has been a huge interest in\nclay
        in the art field. All sorts of artists are not doing finely crafted work because
        they don\u2019t have\nthe skill, but just liking the material and what they
        can do with direct hands on work to that. I\u2019ve\nthought maybe I\u2019m
        going to get to the point where I will back off clay because other people
        will\nbe writing their essays or dissertations on that and I\u2019d find some
        other underdog field to write\nabout at that time.\nIt\u2019s been very satisfying,
        and also my introduction on this personal basis \u2013 small scale, local
        \u2013\nthis place, what\u2019s happening here, good people with kind of noble
        aspirations and good hearts. In\nthe craft field you did not meet people who
        were going into it for fame and fortune. It\u2019s just not\ngoing to happen.
        So they were all motivated by something, the physical process, the feel of
        the\nmaterial, touch comes up a lot, particularly in ceramics but also in
        the other craft mediums. So it\nwas just rewarding and satisfying as I went
        along.\nA kind of oddity of my background is that I ended up living in Japan
        for four years. Of course I\nknew about Japan because of MacKenzie\u2019s
        connection to Bernard Leach and traveling to Japan\nand all that. It just
        so happened that the house we leased in Tokyo was just a quarter of a mile\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n5\nfrom the Nihon
        Mingeikan, the actual heart of the Mingei Movement in Japan. So I went down\nthere
        to try to be a volunteer when I was brand new in Japan, thinking I could be
        a docent or\nsomething. Give tours to the foreign visitors. Well what I found
        out was that they had no idea\nwhat a docent was. They had no concept of that
        in Japan. So I go walking in there and try to ask\na woman at the desk if
        I can volunteer, and she looks at me, deer in the headlights kind of look\nthat
        said, \u201cwhat is this foreigner talking about?\u201d But actually there
        was somebody on staff who\nhad lived in the U.S. and knew what I was talking
        about, so she decided that it was best not to\nhave me give tours, but she
        would walk me around with the curators who mostly did not speak\nEnglish and
        they would talk about the works in an exhibition and she would casually translate\neveryday
        conversations. And I would take notes and write up a little text that would
        appear in\neach room in English for the tourists.\nSo I got this intimate
        acquaintance with Mingei, not as a practitioner, like Randy Johnston or\nsomeone
        going there to do an apprenticeship, but a wonderful, meaningful exposure.
        And I\nthought that would make me less interested in American crafts. I don\u2019t
        mind getting this down on\nthe record. When I came back I was writing about
        art there and I started writing for some\ninternational art publications about
        Japanese art, so when I came back to the States I was not\ngoing to renew
        my acquaintance with craft, because I was thinking about Japanese art in which\nthere
        is, well, this kind of spiritual quality. In Shinto, the indigenous religion
        in Japan, they\nbelieve that the gods, the Kami, can reside in any kind of
        wonderful natural object. It could be\nthis fantastic tree, or a rock or the
        wind \u2013 you know kamikaze is this divine wind with the gods\nin it. Of
        course, when that was used in wartime context it was not nice. Anyways, I
        thought,\nwow, they have this spiritual quality, numinous quality, in the
        works themselves through their\nreligion. That\u2019s the real thing! People
        in the States are just kind of diddling around or pretending.\nBut when I
        came back, I actually changed my mind about that and decided that the Japanese\nculture
        provided that to every artist who was working there. They could exploit it
        or not. In the\nStates when someone is attached or devoted to a single material,
        they are essentially creating that\nkind of a cultural, or religious if you
        want to call it that, rationale for the meaning that they put\ninto that work.
        So they are inventing something that is just handed to the Japanese. So then
        I\nthought, well you know maybe this is cooler. This is pretty admirable that
        everybody works at\nthat, even if they don\u2019t think in those terms.\nAnyway,
        there had been a couple of American potters I met in Japan and so when I came
        back\nconnections reasserted themselves and I began to follow the fields again.
        The dialog about the\ndifference between art and craft had not changed one
        iota in the time I was gone. It probably\nnever will. Don\u2019t worry about
        it. The discussion is interesting, but we don\u2019t need to come to a\nconclusion.
        It\u2019s okay with me. Okay, enough about that.\n00:18:40\nAW: Well, I have
        a couple of follow up questions. On that last note, what was the dialogue\nabout
        art and craft in the nineteen seventies? Locally, nationally, whatever you\u2019d
        like to talk\nabout.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n6\nJK:
        I don\u2019t think it was as much of an issue here. For instance, when I wrote
        for the Daily, and\nsubsequently for the Star, which was the afternoon paper,
        not yet folded into the morning paper\nat that time, anyway, I could write
        about anything. I didn\u2019t have to just write about painting and\nsculpture.
        It was just all considered the visual arts here. In a larger sense, and probably\nparticularly
        in New York \u2013 I think New York has been provincial actually, isn\u2019t
        that funny \u2013\nabout this idea. At the time I visited New York and went
        to this gallery that showed a lot of\ncrafts and the owner said, \u201cDon\u2019t
        use that word here. If somebody uses that word we can only get\ninto the \u201cHome\u201d
        section of the New York Times, not the \u201cArts\u201d section.\u201d So
        there was this sharp\nline drawn and people liked to make the argument that
        because the work was functional it was\nlesser than the pure artistic expression,
        which I don\u2019t buy at all. Architecture isn\u2019t discounted\nbecause
        it is functional.\nSo this line that was at this time fairly sharply drawn
        in New York because the city was so\ninfluential and all the magazines were
        based there, that polluted the rest of the country with that\nidea. And it
        still does come up. You\u2019ll hear a snotty dismissive remark about something
        \u201cjust\u201d\nbeing craft. But based on my own now thirty some years of
        writing in this field, I would say\nevery person I\u2019ve ever heard making
        that dismissive comment is not a particularly great critic.\nThey are people
        who are looking to increase their own stature through diminishing something\nelse.
        And the really good critics, people like Roberta Smith at the New York Times
        and Peter\nSchjeldahl and a number of others I could mention are interested
        in the visual and will respond to\nit on their own terms. I think it is still
        an issue in academia because of academic striving and\npeople fighting against
        each other to enhance their own positions. So craft can still be a field that\nis
        put down but I think at the highest levels of art criticism, it is not excluded
        anymore and that\nline is not drawn. And the interest in alternative forms
        of visual expression, painting is not, well,\nNew York is still a painting
        town, but it\u2019s just not as dominant as it used to be because nowadays\nartists
        work in many mediums so they just use whatever material suits their particular
        purpose at\nthat time. So it\u2019s kind of dissolved as an issue.\nAW: Why
        in the 1970s and 1980s was it not a big issue here? Why was there not the
        line drawn\nas distinctive in art and craft [in Minnesota]?\nJK: Again, I\u2019m
        not sure I was sophisticated enough when I was here to make that kind of an\nanalysis
        of what went on, but maybe there are some sort of cultural explanations. Like
        maybe the\nScandinavian populations were familiar enough with ceramics from
        that background or maybe\nthe Midwest is just more egalitarian in the practical
        sense of making useful things. Or the\nextension from everyday hobby crafts
        into a more skilled kind of work, you know, maybe people\ncould make that
        jump.\nI would also give at least one small nod here to Warren MacKenzie,
        again, and his first wife,\nAlix because, at least the accounts I\u2019ve
        read of that time when he was first here at the end of the\n1940s, they did
        everything they could to promote the idea of pottery. He gave talks for women\u2019s\ngroups,
        libraries or, you know, anybody who would listen to him talk about ceramics.
        He also\ndid things like, at that time, he had his little sales area in his
        studio so people could see how he\nworked, see how things were made at the
        same time they were buying a piece. So that kind of\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n7\njust dogged promotion and the fact
        that he did teach for many years and generated these multiple\ngenerations,
        lineages, of students. Certainly this had to do something. I\u2019ve never
        asked him if he\nencountered certain prejudices when he was first trying to
        set up. By the time I was here in the\nseventies he was, maybe, the art department
        chair at that time? I don\u2019t remember the exact dates.\nAnyways, he was
        for a time the department chair so he was a respected, tenured professor.
        There\nused to be a glass program here [at the University of Minnesota] and
        at one time there was\ntextiles, but I think those were thrown out. But then
        Minnesota does have the Textile Center\nnow, in which a lot of sort of hobby
        type groups have gotten together to present themselves more\nseriously with
        a gallery and everything. So I don\u2019t know the exact explanation, but
        at least those\nthings might have figured into why it happened here.\nIt\u2019s
        also hard maybe to compare it to other places, thinking of ceramics in particular,
        California\nhad a really strong ceramics community, and around the war time
        and immediately after the war\nthere were a lot of small ceramics industries,
        studios that emphasized production, you know, that\nscope of work. Then when
        Peter Voulkos showed up in California in the mid-1950s and very\nrapidly turned
        to doing sculpture rather than the functional things he had done before that,
        you\nknow, that gave another dimension to ceramics in California at that time.
        ArtForum magazine\nwas started in the Bay area and moved to Los Angeles between,
        maybe sixty-four and sixty-seven,\nsomething like that. ArtForum was quite
        supportive of ceramic activities even though it\nwas an art magazine striving
        for national and international recognition. It still accepted ceramics\nin
        that context. So, Minnesota may not be unique in its support, but I think
        it has its own specific\nstory and differs from the kind of work that was
        done in California. If there had been an actual\nregional art magazine based
        here, it probably would have changed the nature of the work that\nwas done
        here.\n00:27:30\nAW: On that note, you brought up some of the other crafts
        that were also important such as\ntextiles and glass. Can you say a little
        more about those? When you went to write about various\nexhibitions and artists,
        who were you meeting and what kind of craft were they producing in the\nTwin
        Cities?\nAW: Oh, and did you actually travel through Minnesota and write about
        stuff, or mainly in the\nTwin Cities.\nJK: Pretty much the Twin Cities. The
        Minnesota Crafts Council sponsored an exhibition each\nyear that was, at that
        time, on the grounds of what was called the College of St. Catherine and\nthat
        would be all mediums and it would be reported on in the Craft Connection magazine
        that I\nwas editing. What I wrote about for the Daily and subsequently the
        Star was entirely dependent\non what was in the galleries.\nWhat I can say
        about glass, I\u2019ve never followed glass quite as closely but there was
        a guy that\nwas teaching it at the U [University of Minnesota]. I think he
        was in sculpture but he was using\nsome glass at that time. If I\u2019m remembering
        right, his name was Wayne Potratz. P-O-T-R-A-T-Z\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n8\nor something like that, whom I\u2019ve
        never met. There was also a guy that I do remember writing\nabout who was
        doing cutting-edge, not just beautiful objects, in glass and his name was
        Fred\nTschida. T-S-C-H-I-D-A, I think. Then there were other people like Dick
        Huss, who I think is\nstill around, but who I didn\u2019t know personally,
        but I remember his name from those days in\nglass. In textiles, I don\u2019t
        know if I can come up with names so much. I was probably closer to\nceramics
        in those days, or maybe it was just shown more.\n00:30:08\nAW: Do you remember
        or can you reflect on the communities in each, the glass community,\ntextile
        community, ceramics community, and the audiences? Was it the same audiences
        for all of\nthose crafts? Were the communities interacting at all? Can you
        tell us a little bit more?\nJK: Well, as far as I know, the Minnesota Crafts
        Council was attempting to bring all those things\ntogether. This is more speculation
        than certainty, but I would speculate that there were different\naudiences
        but that galleries would not tend to specialize in just one thing. I think
        Sontag Gallery\nwas pretty much, well everything that I remember from there
        anyway, was ceramics. Maybe she\nshowed something else. So that\u2019s why
        I think there probably were different audiences. Anyway,\nthe Crafts Council
        that I was involved with was trying to pull everybody together so that the
        craft\nfairs, like Uptown which still exists, were all mediums, not just one.\nAW:
        So when did the [Minnesota] Crafts Council start? And can you tell us a little
        bit about that\nhistory?\nJK: Before I was here, it seems to me that it was
        towards the end of the sixties that it was\norganized. In 2009 I briefly served
        as guest editor of American Craft magazine. It was still\nlocated in New York
        at that time. It was before they moved here and they just needed somebody\nto
        fill in as editor. And I remember that there was a report on the Twin Cities
        craft scene\npublished at that time. This resulted in a bunch of letters disputing
        tiny details of the history that\nthe artists had written in there and I thought,
        Wow, I didn\u2019t think that would be a controversial\nthing! It was just
        nice that Minnesota was represented in a national magazine. Why would people\nsay
        \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t in 1968 it was 1965!\u201d or whatever. So, I\u2019m
        not sure I know the exact story of\nthe [Minnesota] Crafts Council, or for
        that matter, the beginning of Northern Clay, which has\ncertainly been an
        important institution here. At any rate, at the time I started working with
        the\nMinnesota Crafts Council they had only been doing the publication, well,
        maybe it was its first\nyear? I was still a journalism student at the U [University
        of Minnesota] so I was just kind of an\nintern or apprentice to the person
        who was their first editor. Then I applied for the job\nsubsequently. That
        was mid-seventies so it was all sort of formative still at that time.\nAW:
        When you started at the U [University of Minnesota] did you know you wanted
        to be a\njournalism student from the very beginning, or journalism major?
        Or did you explore other\noptions? Was journalism a passion of yours?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n9\nJK: I think when I
        started college my first major was sociology. I didn\u2019t think I wanted
        to be a\nsocial worker and what else do you do with that. So then again, these
        totally random personal\nthings that happen to you that lead on. Since I was
        finally going back to finish my education, I\nwas already married and my husband
        worked for IBM, it used to be the joke about IBM that it\nstood for \u201cI\u2019ve
        been moved\u201d because they would transfer all their employees. So we knew
        that\nthat was in our future, that we were going to live in different places.
        I was always interested in\nwriting and as a kid had thought I was going to
        be a poet, but that never went anywhere, but I\nthought journalism would be
        a portable profession, something I could do no matter where my\nhusband\u2019s
        work took us, which indeed it was. I mean, right now it\u2019s a terrible
        profession to go\ninto, with newspapers and magazines drying up and blowing
        away. You can write all you want\nonline but you don\u2019t get paid for it.
        I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to go into journalism\nright now,
        but at that time, it was an interesting thing to do. As it happened in my
        life, as we\nmoved, journalistic writing also offered me the chance to engage
        with each new location and to\nmeet people. You know if you\u2019re going
        to interview somebody that starts your connections. So it\nwas a great thing
        to do, it worked out very well for me. But I didn\u2019t know it was going
        to be art\njournalism when I was just starting. That was a surprise. An accident.\n00:35:28\nAW:
        A happy accident; a great accident.\nJK: Yeah. Turned out that way.\nAW: Yes,
        because you\u2019ve provided so many great works on craft. We\u2019ll get
        into this hopefully a\nlittle bit more later. So when you are at the U [University
        of Minnesota] in the early seventies\nand you said you got to know Jeff [Oestreich]
        and Connee [Mayeron] and some others, can you\nsay anything about getting
        to know other students at the U? Art, craft students or ceramic\nstudents?
        Did you get to know students or faculty in the ceramics program at the U while
        you\nwere at the U or was that after?\nJK: No, I don\u2019t think I did really.
        I mean I was meeting people through the Minnesota Crafts\nCouncil, but I wasn\u2019t
        at the point in my writing that I would do studio visits. That is always a\nnice
        way to meet people. I just didn\u2019t know enough to even engage in that
        type of activity. I was\nworking with galleries so I wasn\u2019t necessarily
        meeting individuals.\nAW: That is interesting because you have the perspective
        then from the galleries. Some of the\npotters we have interviewed have talked
        about the galleries and the Tour and being able to show\nwork on their own
        terms as being important. Can you talk about the role of galleries in\nsupporting
        craft artists during that time in the seventies and how that has changed?\nJK:
        I\u2019m probably speaking in a larger sense, more than just Minnesota, but
        it seems to me that\nthe way the craft field went is that there were shops,
        and then there were galleries that gave more\nspace, more isolation, treated
        things better and were very important for a big chunk of time both\nin raising
        the prices of work, which was better for the makers, and in exposing it and
        taking it\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n10\nseriously
        in a public way. In the last decade maybe, the galleries are disappearing.
        Specialty\ngalleries have disappeared because there is no longer that distinction,
        that wall that I was talking\nabout. So if I go to New York this year and
        just walk around to the galleries, I\u2019m going to see\nceramics. There
        are definitely artists who are working in textile mediums as well [who are
        in\nNew York galleries]. Jewelry, no, it doesn\u2019t make that jump for the
        most part. We now have\ndesign galleries that include art wear, that could
        be clothing or jewelry or things like that.\nThe galleries, or craft media
        that were accepted into the art galleries, no longer needed to be\nthese specialty
        spaces devoted to a single medium, so those have really disappeared. I\u2019m
        trying\nto think of who is left. Garth Clark had a ceramic gallery in New
        York but closed that. He said it\nwas the end of crafts but it was really
        just the end of his gallery that\u2019s all. (laughs) So what\u2019s\nhappening
        now and it does play into the [St. Croix Pottery] Tour, one is looking at
        the situation\nnow and how do you market this work. Particularly functional
        work, which has a little bit harder\ntime finding its way into the art galleries
        mostly because it is sold for a more modest price and\ntherefore doesn\u2019t
        suit the price structure of art galleries. And if it does get raised to that
        price\nlevel, people aren\u2019t going to use it anymore because then it is
        too precious to risk damaging it.\nThe option that the Tour seems to provide
        nowadays is direct sales out of studios so they [artists]\ndon\u2019t have
        to be paying a middleman anymore. So they get a hundred percent of the profits.
        Of\ncourse, this also means that they have to do things galleries did for
        them like PR and maintaining\nimages, dealing with the public and certain
        kinds of record keeping, that plenty of people don\u2019t\nwant to do. If
        you sell out of your studio you have to do all those things. You have to be
        the\nbusiness office, the shipping department, everything that\u2019s needed
        for that activity. So it\u2019s maybe\nnot heaven, unless you have a partner
        who does the more business oriented side \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky\nin that
        way- but it does seem to be working as an option today for somebody to actually
        make a\nliving that way.\nWithin the crafts field itself, or maybe I\u2019m
        just speaking about ceramics here, I think the field at\nlarge has been dismissive
        of functional work. There are people, and Garth Clark has done this as\na
        matter of fact, who say, \u201cOh you can\u2019t make a living at functional
        pottery.\u201d Well, you can too!\nAnd now that he [Clark] has gotten out
        of New York, I don\u2019t know how much time he has spent\nin Minnesota, but
        he made a tour of North Carolina last year, apparently his first time there.\nWhich
        I thought, Oh for pete\u2019s sake, because that\u2019s another big center
        for ceramic activity. Again\nan example of New York provincialism, of thinking
        that something in New York is the only\nanswer to every question. So he gets
        there and he meets plenty of potters who are making a\nliving in North Carolina
        and if he spent any time here he would discover the same thing. You\nknow,
        maybe you don\u2019t make a ton of money, but then hey, there are plenty of
        painters and\nsculptors and every type of artist who don\u2019t make a ton
        of money either. Functional crafts,\nactually, because they are utilitarian
        and modestly priced, do have an option for a bigger market\nthan art at large,
        so ceramic sculptors should not be dismissing function. It is another vital
        and\nviable option. So let\u2019s see, does that answer the question about
        the position of galleries?\nI still think, if it could be worked out financially,
        for me as a critic and person who goes to\ngalleries that I do appreciate
        seeing things in galleries. Even the most purely functional objects,\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n11\nbecause I think they
        can be responded to as visual creations. If you pay a lot of attention to
        a\nceramic surface it\u2019s as beautiful as an abstract painting. It has
        texture, color, movement, and\nbesides that it has touch, you can pick it
        up. So I think to see it isolated on a pedestal or table or\nmounted on a
        wall in a gallery gives you the option to focus on those visual qualities.
        I think it\u2019s\nstill really nice to be able to see work in that way, whether
        it\u2019s in a purely commercial gallery or\nin a museum that presents work.
        If you walk into a shop you are going to see a lot more stuff all\ncrowded
        together, and you can still make the effort to focus, but the piece is not
        going to be lit as\nwell. It\u2019s not going to be isolated from its surroundings
        to be appreciated in that singular way.\nAnd maybe because we don\u2019t have
        the Japanese tea ceremony, which was a way of examining\nthe object in very
        intense focus, a gallery would kind of substitute for that tea ceremony\nconcentration
        here. Although, you know there is a guy in North Carolina who is talking about
        the\nice tea ceremony, Southern hospitality and using ceramics for that. I
        think that\u2019s cute. (laughs)\n00:44:45\nAW: Can you talk a little bit
        more about the tea ceremony? Is that something that you observed\nor learned
        about while you were in Japan?\nJK: Oh, I knew a little bit about it before,
        and it\u2019s certainly something that people talk about in\nJapan. Or rather,
        in ceramics in the U.S. They do talk about it in Japan as well. In Japan today
        a\nlot of the tea ceremony is just a social grace that nice young women are
        taught to do. Wear your\nkimono, sit on your feet, and offer a serving of
        tea. I once talked to an English museum person\nwho was visiting Japan who
        said at its best museum work was like the tea ceremony, in that the\ncurators
        would be talking about an object and examining it in that same sort of intense\ndirectness.
        I thought that was a really nice idea as well. I think what I knew about it
        in relation to\nBuddhism in its old history in Japan the tea ceremony was
        \u2013 the tea house was \u2013 an egalitarian\nplace in which even the shoguns
        who wanted to come in for the tea ceremony had to take off\ntheir swords and
        the weapons were left outside and everyone sat on the same level right together.\nSo
        it had this notion of sharing. But mostly it was this distilled aesthetic
        experience. You were in\nthis little room with maybe one window with a carefully
        controlled view so no distractions. Your\nhost would prepare the tea for you
        and you would examine the bowl before you drank from it\nand talk about those
        kind of aesthetic experiences. When I went to Japan there were a couple of\ntimes
        that, like once, touring a temple we took part in a tea ceremony with a small
        number of\npeople. That was when I discovered the kind of tea they use. It\u2019s
        a powered tea that they mix and\nit\u2019s terribly bitter so they also give
        you a little sweet. The thing to do, as I found out, is you hold\nthe sweet
        in your mouth while you drink the tea so you can tolerate it. At least, that
        is what\nforeigners do, I don\u2019t know if the Japanese do that.\nAnother
        time I was visiting an art gallery in the Ginza, a part of Tokyo, that showed
        all kinds of\ncontemporary art. The owner of it, an older businessman, took
        down a box that was on a higher\nshelf in the office and opened up the little
        layers and took out this tea bowl and had tea prepared\nfor, I don\u2019t
        know, maybe there were two or three of us sitting there. That was probably
        some\nvery valuable object. I didn\u2019t know enough about things to know
        exactly what it was. So, it was\njust sort of a magnification of the experience
        of use. Something that, in a way, we can do.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n12\nIn the galleries in Japan the practice
        there was if you come into a gallery just to look around you\nwere going to
        be served tea. Just everyday sort of tea, but it will be brought to you on
        a little\nwooden plate with a bowl on it, not a handled cup, but a Japanese
        kind of tea bowl that you drink\nout of. In the summertime you\u2019d be furnished
        with a barley tea that\u2019s not sweet, it\u2019s called\nmugicha. Which
        I came to love, it\u2019s very refreshing. That was just the ordinary experience
        of\nwalking around to the gallery, being served tea. So, you had a ceramic
        object there. You know,\nfood in Japan too, well I don\u2019t know how much
        this relates, but when you eat in Japan you have\nlots of little dishes. They
        are not all ceramic \u2013 they might be lacquer or sometimes tempura\nwould
        be served in a little basket, so you know different kinds of materials \u2013
        but you handle\nalmost all of them. You pick up a rice bowl, so your hands
        are touching all these different\nmaterials. I was thinking that it does apply
        here because, for instance, when I had lunch and did\nan interview with Randy
        and Jan Johnston [potters], they had their own dishes but lots of little\nthings
        on the table. I don\u2019t even remember what was in all the small dishes,
        but wonderful things\nto look at. Maybe that\u2019s a little of an adaptation
        of everyday in Japan. I think that\u2019s why people\nin Japan tend to be
        sensitive to materials and a potter in Japan can feel assured that if he makes\nsome
        kind of subtle change in his work, that he will have an audience that will
        recognize and\nappreciate that difference. Whereas here we tend to expect
        more of a grand gesture or difference\nin form or a completely new glaze or
        something like that that is very obvious change. We don\u2019t\nhave the same
        ability to recognize subtlety just because we\u2019re not constantly exposed
        to it.\n00:50:25\nAW: I think you bring up a really interesting point about
        the connection of food and pottery.\nSeveral of the potters have talked about
        how they have had or have a passion for cooking and\nwhy they were attracted
        to functional pottery was combining those interests in a way. Finding the\nbest
        plate to showcase a cheesecake, actually, is what Connee [Mayeron] talked
        about. One of\nher early desires was just finding something that would just
        really show off the food. Can you\nsay a little bit more about that connection
        here in America? Between food and pottery,\nspecifically functional pottery,
        how that might have played a role?\nJK: You know, historically, the association,
        like European porcelain, was a status object on\nlavish display on tables
        by the kings or, you know, whoever the people were that were collecting.\nSome
        of those guys had collections that were thousands of objects and could serve
        a hundred and\ntwenty people at once. You would have centerpieces and you
        would have candelabras and all\nkinds of display objects, but they also had
        a function. The function was larger than just putting\nfood in a dish in front
        of you. Certainly in our culture, that\u2019s a social ritual that is very
        important\nto us. Dining and to share an object. If you go to a potter\u2019s
        house you\u2019re never going to be given\na set of identical things. Everybody\u2019s
        not going to have the same dishes all the way around the\ntable and that\u2019s
        a little bit of a hard jump for the average public person that is used to
        buying a\nten-piece table setting or when you get married you get these sets
        of identical pieces and you just\ntake one off the shelf and you don\u2019t
        think about it. You know what you\u2019re getting and it\u2019s all\nvery
        uniform. The experience of using functional pottery is that each piece, even
        if they are a set,\nthey\u2019re not going to be exactly identical. You don\u2019t
        want them to be. Why would you want them\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n13\nto be!? You know when you begin to think about this
        you look back at our ceramic industry and\nthe production of dinnerware and
        you think, how boring. But you have to get to that point, and\nyou have to
        be willing to invest more money in an individual object.\nI\u2019ll tell you
        another personal story. My children grew up with pottery around, we even had
        a\ndinnerware set that we had Jeff Oestreich make for us, it was a set, but
        it was hand decorated and\nso it was not identical. So my kids grew up with
        that, but have not traditionally been buyers or\nconsumers of pottery themselves.
        Sometimes I would make my visits here coincide with the\npottery tour, so
        I could do that. So, I took my older daughter with me and she enjoyed it.
        She\nliked looking and it was nice that we could spend time together. Once
        we were at Bob\u2019s\n[Briscoe] and he shows a young person who was an apprentice
        to him named Jason Trebs, who is\nfrom St. Paul, and my daughter and I both
        really liked Jason\u2019s bowls. But she [daughter] said,\n\u201cThirty dollars
        for a bowl?!\u201d You know, you can get a bowl, a plastic bowl, for what,
        a dollar\nninety-nine? And I said, \u201cWell look, this guy went to college
        or to art school or something and\nhe had to set up a studio and buy his equipment
        and he\u2019s having to pay taxes and do all this\nbusiness. He\u2019s not
        a peasant in China who makes pennies a day.\u201d You know? So there are all\nthese
        reasons that justify the cost. Of course, being a sucker, I bought the bowl
        for her and one\nfor me. Then when I would come back to visit her, she had
        the bowl out all the time. She had\nfruit in it usually. And she said, \u201cYou
        know, I just love that bowl!\u201d So, the next time we went on\nthe pottery
        tour together, she bought a piece or two of Jason\u2019s and maybe something
        else. Now,\nI\u2019m not a big collector, I\u2019ve been collecting for a
        long time so I just have a lot of small things.\nBut I would say, she\u2019s
        now committed to buying individual things. She\u2019s looking for plates and\nshe
        wants to get rid of her old set of Pottery Barn or whatever it is and have
        all these individual\nplates. So yay! Also, her husband is quite a good cook
        and so it\u2019s been interesting for them. He\u2019s\nmade some things that
        look really good on some of those dishes. They are all so individual. It\njust
        gives you scope for a social experience and a visual experience, a kind of
        creative exchange\nor engagement with an object. It works for you and you
        do something for it.\n00:55:54\nJK: The relation of food and pottery? Let\u2019s
        see. I\u2019m sure there is much more that can be said\nabout it then that.
        One of the things that is of interest to me, not specifically in Minnesota
        but in\nfunctional pottery right now, there is an interest in trying to find
        new forms in pottery. So not just\nbowls and plates and mugs. So there are
        people who are making unusual shaped plates and also\nthings like a juicer,
        there\u2019s no reason that can\u2019t be in ceramics. There are people who
        are doing\nthat. There\u2019s a young woman here in St. Paul who has made
        a specialty of making spoons and\nspreaders. Now, you wouldn\u2019t give those
        to a small child, but rather you\u2019d use them in certain\ncontrolled situations
        to avoid the risk of breakage. That\u2019s something that has not traditionally\nbeen
        made in ceramics and is a new option. It\u2019s nice to me that that kind
        of invention is going on.\nAW: You had talked about Warren MacKenzie when
        he came to give a talk. Can you say a little\nbit more about when you met
        Warren what was it like and what was he talking about and how\ndid that speak
        to you? And if you can say a little bit more about functional pottery in Minnesota.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n14\nJK: When he
        talked to that class that I was in, the very first time I ever met him or
        saw him, he\nwas not only talking about ceramics but he was telling us about
        other forms of work. That was a\nlong time ago and I can\u2019t remember specifically
        who he mentioned or who he lead us to, but I\u2019m\npretty sure that one
        of the people he recommended was Walter Nottingham, who taught textiles\nat
        River Falls [University of Wisconsin] at that time. When I interviewed him
        [Nottingham] he\ntalked about--he didn\u2019t make functional objects--but
        making the unseen seen through his work. It\nwas kind of mystical, you might
        say a little hocus pocus, but I thought it was good work. We also\nfound a
        guy doing copper-smithing and a Greek immigrant who was carving wood panels.
        We\nalso included someone who made refrigerator magnets, which I\u2019m sure
        horrified some of the\nmore serious artists included in that magazine.\nI\u2019m
        pretty sure at that first meeting he [Warren] told us about Japan and about
        Mingei and\nBernard Leach and his experience of going there. I think I remember
        from that very first\nencounter of him telling this story of when Hamada and
        Yanagi, the founder of Mingei, and\nLeach made a tour of the United States
        in 1952 and came here [to Minnesota] and there was a\nsale of Hamada\u2019s
        work. You had to draw a number to get in and choose an object and Warren\u2019s\nnumber
        was way back. And almost everything was sold at that time but he chose a piece
        and\nYanagi told him he had chosen the best piece in the show. So at that
        time I was not writing about\nart yet, it was all a new language to me. It
        was just striking to think that you couldn\u2019t make an\nimmediate judgment.
        You had to think about things and you had to look closely because you\nmight
        not recognize the virtues of an object at first glance.\nI think Warren was
        just doing his promotional thing that he had been doing for years. He was\ntalking
        to a bunch of journalism students who knew nothing about his field and he
        was just\ntrying to make us see what was interesting about it and what some
        of the options were. When I\nactually did interview him for the magazine he
        was expanding on those experiences and talking\nmore specifically about his
        creative expression through pottery.\n01:00:52\nAW: So when you were talking
        with him or when he was presenting to the class, do you\nremember what he
        said about why he found success in Minnesota with functional pottery? Was\nthere
        a receptive audience?\nJK: I don\u2019t think there was a receptive audience.
        I think he made it. He has said later, at least I\nthink he has said it and
        others have commented too, the nature of the subtlety of the kind of\npottery
        he does \u2013 and most of the people on the Tour do too \u2013 relates to
        the Minnesota landscape.\nYou would be unlikely to make such subtle work if
        you lived in New York City, for instance. If\nyou were in a harried kind of
        urban, vertical, hard surface it would vary from here where you\nhave the
        lines of the landscape. Somebody in Georgia, an old time potter there, once
        talked about\nhow at one time pottery was made to attract tourists, so it
        was brightly colored. And then that\nkind of fell out of fashion and then
        they went back to browns. I remember this guy saying he\u2019d\nnever met
        a potter who doesn\u2019t like earth colors. I think that is the case here
        too. I mean\nobviously there is porcelain in pure white and there is wonderful
        color that can be brought into\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n15\nclay. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all,
        but it does seem very harmonious to have these\nearth colored things that
        are made here.\nAW: It\u2019s interesting you say that because when we were
        talking with Guillermo, he said when he\nwas looking to move to the US permanently
        [from Venezuela], he had friends in the Southwest\nhe was looking to stay
        with and friends in Minnesota, and he was concerned that the pottery he\nmade
        might not speak to the audience or the design styles you find in the Southwest
        pottery\nworld. Do you have any comments about that? Does pottery have a regional
        audience or\nregional connection that is hard to translate to other areas?
        How does the Minnesota functional\npottery compare to other regions?\nJK:
        Well, there are exceptions here. There are people who do highly colorful works
        here. Or like\nMaren Kloppmann, who makes very geometric pieces. There used
        to be a woman who lived\nhere, I don\u2019t know if she still does, named
        Amy Sabrina, who did pictorial, decorative work.\nThere are several other
        people who are doing low fired highly colored decorative work that looks\nlike
        Italian pottery or something like that. So there are exceptions. It\u2019s
        not to say everybody here\nmakes the same thing by any means. If you go to
        Connee Mayeron\u2019s site you will see the people\nshe invites and even her
        own work is not the earth kinds of tones.\nI would say California has had
        more design-oriented pottery. California doesn\u2019t have a real\nstrong
        functional tradition going on today. It\u2019s got more sculptural work today.
        The Southeast is\nprobably the most similar to Minnesota just because they
        never completely lost their folk pottery\nthere. We did here. There were still
        folk potteries around when functional pottery became an\ninterest during the
        post-war baby boom of the 1960s. There were still operative people in the\nSoutheast
        making gallon jugs and all that stuff. That was all efficient and functional,
        using local\nclay and glazes. So there are sections of the country that have
        a regional character, but I would\nsay at the same time there are so many
        ceramic residency programs now. Maybe you might work\nin some kind of an apprentice
        situation after you got out of undergraduate school, but even after\ngraduate
        school it can be hard to set up a studio on your own. So there are these places
        like the\nArchie Bray Foundation and Penland, and Watershed, places you can
        go and live. So it\u2019s gotten\nto the point that it\u2019s not unusual
        to find somebody who spends ten years going around to those\nresidency programs
        and then finally is ready to set up on their own. I think that has kind of\nstirred
        the pot so it minimizes the regional character because people are moving so
        much and\nworking with people from other regions and sharing information and
        ideas. I don\u2019t think it is\nunreasonable for Guillermo to say that if
        he was committed to a certain look that he would find a\nmore receptive audience
        in one place rather than another. That\u2019s still true, but less tightly\nregional
        today then it used to be.\n01:07:05\nAW: One last note about ceramics on the
        national landscape. You mentioned earlier about\npotters being able to make
        it [functional pottery] a career. Can you tell us how career\nopportunities
        for potters have changed over time? Bob [Briscoe] had mentioned in his interview\nthat
        in the fifties and sixties most potters were teachers as kind of a main part
        of their income and\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n16\nmaybe
        later they retired to focus on pottery. Maybe today this might not be true
        so much\nanymore. Maybe your entire income can be made by the pottery you
        are producing?\nJK: I\u2019m not so sure that the pattern is exactly like
        that or maybe that is not exactly the reason\nbecause throughout the twentieth
        century there have been potters and there have been functional\npotters. There
        have been small-scale industry or more artistic kind of studios. When I worked
        on\nthe book Makers: A History of American Studio Craft we could go back and
        document in every\ndecade people who were working primarily as potters. There
        were art colonies back in those days\nwhere maybe it wasn\u2019t a residency
        program but it amounted to the same thing; a sympathetic\nenvironment where
        people would be working in multiple mediums and developing an audience.\nSomeone
        might come for the textiles but see the ceramics. There was that kind of way
        to build\nan audience. There were also places in the early post-war period.
        There was Gump\u2019s in San\nFrancisco that was kind of a high-end department
        store but they did market handmade objects.\nThey were a good market for crafts
        in those days.\nIn New York City there was the American Craft Council, which
        in the 1940s opened a place\ncalled America House that sold fine, handmade
        crafts. The idea was to enable people to make a\nliving and have a market.
        I think teaching became an option so much just because of the post-\nWar baby
        boom going to college. It started after the war with everybody going to college
        on the\nG. I. Bill. The college population expanded so there was more need
        for teachers. There were\npeople teaching things who hardly knew their subject!
        Everybody was desperate to learn\ntechnical things and trying to keep up on
        the field, to keep up with what their students were\ndoing. So with the baby
        boom and the expansion of colleges and art programs it seemed for a\ntime
        that anybody who graduated from a program could find a teaching job. That\u2019s
        just not true\nanymore. I think it started falling off toward the end of the
        1980s. It\u2019s been gradually going on\nfor a while. It\u2019s easier to
        talk about these things if we simplify, but as you would know, history is\nnever
        that simple. That\u2019s all I have to say about that maybe.\n01:11:00\nAW:
        Why do you think it is that people can now have their main job now be a potter?\nJK:
        Well, the ability to promote things nowadays through the Internet and mailing
        lists for\ninstance. I hope somebody has mentioned this to you in one of your
        conversations, but I think the\ngreat advantages the [St. Croix] Pottery Tour
        has is the specific geography here. That only one\nhour out of a major metropolitan
        area it\u2019s cheap enough that these people could afford to buy\nland and
        set up a studio. No matter how primitive their beginnings were, they could
        do that.\nWhereas in Chicago you have a huge potential audience there but
        two hours out you\u2019re still in\nthe suburbs, so you really have to go
        a long way. Then the question becomes, how far out will\npeople go for a pottery
        tour? Can you get that far out of town and have this sort of thing. But\nhere
        it is an easy day trip. You could do all seven of them [the pottery stops]
        and still get it done\nin a day if you didn\u2019t know everybody and weren\u2019t
        stopping to talk all the time. So there is that\nspecific advantage that made
        it easier to live as a potter and to market here. It\u2019s probably a little\nharder
        for people who have chosen to live in the city, although the Twin Cities are
        still very\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n17\naffordable
        compared to other cities. I\u2019ve heard statistically that it is about thirty
        percent cheaper\nto live here than in New York for instance. How could you
        be a functional potter and live in New\nYork? Pretty impossible idea.\nOne
        other thing, I do know specifically about the pottery tour that was held in
        Austin, Texas that\nwas specifically modeled on this pottery tour and the
        success of this one. They even have it on\nMother\u2019s Day weekend as well,
        and they also have invited artists from other locations. I\u2019m sure\nthere
        have been shared studio sales and the idea of the pottery tour just as a notion
        probably is\nnot unique, but the way they developed it \u2013 and I\u2019ll
        be interested to hear what you learn about\nhow it developed over time and
        the number of participants \u2013 they\u2019ve set up a model for taking\nthis
        seriously. They are also setting up a model at this moment as to how this
        is going to be\nhanded over to the next generation. That\u2019s a big question
        because everybody who is on the Tour\nnow is sufficiently mature, and were
        mature twenty some years ago when it started, which means\nthey are pretty
        close to senior now.\nAW: That is definitely a concern on a lot of people\u2019s
        minds as to how to transition it.\n1:14:30 \u2013 [END OF FIRST INTERVIEW]\nAW:
        We\u2019re resuming the interview with Janet Koplos. This is Andy Wilhide.
        It is August 26th,\n2014, and we are here at her home in St. Paul, Minnesota,
        resuming our interview for \u201cA\nMeasure of the Earth: An Oral History
        of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley.\u201d Thank you\nJanet.\nWe
        were just chatting about the last interview and you had concluded that portion
        by talking\nabout how important location is in the success of some of these
        tours. The St. Croix Tour, but\nalso some other tours and the advantage of
        the proximity of the St. Croix Valley to a major\nmetropolitan area, but still
        far enough away that it is still affordable for the potters themselves. Is\nthere
        anything else you want to say about the importance of location in the success
        of the Tour or\nhow it compares to other tours?\nJK: I was just trying to
        think if there is anything that distinguishes it in the sense of, well,\neconomics
        for instance or the sociology of the region or something like that. I mean
        you can\u2019t\nreally do this sort of thing in a place like New York because
        it is not an affordable place to live\nand you have to be so far out for it
        to be affordable. I mean there are organizations and groups of\npotters that
        find other ways to cope with that but it means the pottery in those places
        tends to be\nmuch more expensive, so then that limits the market in a way
        as well. What generalization can I\nmake? There are places like Austin and
        also Seattle, which doesn\u2019t have a strong functional\npottery orientation,
        but there certainly are people there who are doing well and maybe there is\nsome
        energy building in those places. They also are like the Twin Cities, just
        good middle class\nkinds of urban areas. So the ones with the most, well I
        don\u2019t know if I could sustain that without\nfurther research and comparison,
        but that would be my perception. That\u2019s as far as I want to go\non it,
        I\u2019m not going to claim that\u2019s true.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n18\nAW: You were just talking about Chicago
        and having heard from some potters that it is hard to\nsell functional pottery
        there. Can you tell us a little bit more for the national context on the\nreception
        of functional pottery. Where are the places where it is not really well received?\nJK:
        Oddly enough, Los Angeles does not have much of a functional marketplace.
        You would\nthink it would because there is definitely a design orientation
        there that is quite prominent and it\nalso has an important history in twentieth
        century ceramic sculpture. Clay itself is significant or\naccepted in L. A.,
        but somehow or another it just hasn\u2019t developed a climate of encouraging
        or\ndeveloping a market for functional pottery. We could probably say something
        the same about\nChicago. It does have a couple of ceramic institutions. I
        mean, Hull House, a settlement house,\nback in the early twentieth century
        had a ceramic program that was very successful for quite a\nwhile. Now there
        are a couple of buildings that function as artist centers that have a lot
        of\nceramics in them, but not so much the individual studio potter. They all
        tend to be out\nsomewhere else.\nOther places, it seems that almost every
        community that I ever hear about has some local potters\nliving there, some
        people who produce some things. That seems to be not uncommon across the\nU.
        S. I would think a distinction that could be made in praise of this area is
        that it\u2019s not kitschy\nstuff. It\u2019s not just highly decorated very
        obviously appealing following a kind of formula, and I\nthink that might be
        a consequence of the fact that, as I said before, this just kind of bloomed
        out\nof Warren MacKenzie\u2019s teaching and there was a philosophical background
        to his work in clay,\nwhich you wouldn\u2019t normally expect to be the case
        anywhere. He had this international\nknowledge and experience and so the people
        that he taught were exposed to that, and I think that\nmakes it a different
        environment. So other places where there might just be a potter, or just\nsomebody
        who likes to make things or likes the touch, they are not really thinking
        of it in terms\nof the social and philosophical significance for our time.
        That is something important to do\nnowadays. That would be something that
        distinguishes this area.\nProbably the best comparison, there\u2019s a bit
        of that same thoughtfulness, in the Southeast,\nparticularly North Carolina.
        They had not lost the tradition of folk pottery. It continued up until\nthe
        time of post World War II when studio pottery became more widespread. Also,
        strangely\nenough there is a place in North Carolina called Jugtown Pottery
        that was formed by two\nsophisticates from Raleigh who had lived in New York
        City and sold folk pottery in New York\nCity, and then came back to North
        Carolina and established this pottery. They were designing\nand conceptualizing
        the work but they weren\u2019t actually the ones who were doing it. They were\ndrawing
        on that folk pottery background. Anyway, this is a very long winded way to
        get to the\npoint that this was in maybe the twenties, I can\u2019t remember
        the exact date when Jugtown was\nfounded, but the fellow of this couple knew
        about Chinese ceramics and so some of the shapes\nthat he had folk potters
        make for Jugtown were Asian influenced shapes. So that\u2019s a little bit\nunusual,
        and we had a different instance of it here. I mention that example to say
        that influences\ncan come in unexpected ways.\n01:22:45\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n19\nAW: You\u2019ve talked about
        the significance of Warren and his networking and public speaking.\nI\u2019m
        interested in the various audiences. If Warren had landed somewhere else do
        you think\nfunctional pottery would have developed as strongly in Minnesota?
        Do you think he would have\nhad such a strong response to his work elsewhere?
        The major audience seems to be in the Twin\nCities, the urban population.
        Not necessarily the people who were right in the St. Croix River\nValley.
        Trying to trace the development of functional pottery in Minnesota, who were
        the first\nsupporters of his work? How does that work in other parts of the
        country \u2013 is the local audience\nthe main audience? We were talking about
        the approximation to the large metropolitan\npopulation that would consume
        this pottery.\nJK: I think that if these people were just trying to serve
        the local population in the St. Croix\nValley they couldn\u2019t make a living
        because there just aren\u2019t enough people. There is not enough\npopulation
        to be buying stuff there.\nAW: I don\u2019t know if this was always the case.
        A few people [potters] mentioned that local\nrestaurants would ask them to
        make stuff for restaurants. So there was some local support early\non?\nJK:
        Well I can think of a potter out on the West Coast who lives out in the country
        who has\ngotten restaurant commissions because he is not that far from the
        Bay area and so with the\nsophisticated eating there he\u2019s making a living
        in a rural area. But, again, he\u2019s not necessarily\nserving his rural
        population with this. So, maybe it is more of an urban phenomenon. As to\nwhether
        Warren could have landed someplace else and done this same thing. I guess
        I would say\nI suspect so. I don\u2019t know if he could have done it in Chicago
        because of the geographic\ndifficulty we already talked about there. Say he
        had been in St. Louis or some other place, I think\nthere has to be a certain
        population. He needed that in order to generate this level of activity over\ntime.\nBacking
        up, I\u2019m thinking of Clary Illian, who lives near Iowa City or something
        like that. She\nalso had the experience of going to the Leach Pottery and
        she came back and she does, well I\ndon\u2019t know the exact geographic boundaries
        she draws from, but she does think of herself as\nbeing a local potter, serving
        that distinctly regional population. Even if Des Moines, or Iowa City\nwhich
        is far smaller, maybe they add up to enough to support a potter. Could she
        have a pottery\ntour there? Is there that kind of activity? No, I don\u2019t
        think so. You just have to have a bunch of\npeople that are interested.\nAs
        an aside, I just met a person here in the Twin Cities who as it turns out
        has been collecting\npottery since he was in his twenties and he must be in
        his sixties now I suppose, but he did not\nknow about Northern Clay Center.
        He\u2019s not buying locally. He is a pottery consumer and he\nwould buy when
        he traveled to Europe and to Asia. Isn\u2019t that strange!? You\u2019re right
        here in this\nhotbed of ceramic activity and you did not know? So to reach
        everybody who would be a\npotential consumer of this work is difficult, unpredictable,
        and random. How did this guy miss\nall the information on what\u2019s available?\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n20\nAW: Was there
        a kind of style he was collecting that was not really inline with the functional\nstyle
        of pottery? Is that why he maybe didn\u2019t pay attention to it here?\nJK:
        Well actually I have seen his collection now because I was very curious about
        this and he\ndoes have a few things that are consistent with this, but yes,
        your point might be well taken\nbecause he tends to have more things in a
        style popular with the French and in Holland with a\nblue glaze. It\u2019s
        a little more finished, a little more perfect. It does not look like commercial\npottery,
        but it doesn\u2019t have that kind of earthy more rough-hewn wood fired aesthetic
        that is so\npopular here. It might be that he saw one of those things and
        that was what he responded to and\nnow he\u2019s just ended up with a few
        things that represent something closer to the Minnesota range.\nBut he doesn\u2019t
        have anything from any of the people I\u2019ve collected from around here.
        He has\ngone to Northern Clay since I met him. So maybe he will become another
        portion of this market.\nAW: Well that\u2019s good that you helped him realize
        what is around here, in the great ceramics and\nart community that is around
        here.\n01:29:35\nJK: There are other places that don\u2019t depend specifically
        on one single city, and I\u2019m thinking of\nMaine, which also has a good
        deal of ceramic activity comparable to here. It has a ceramic\nresidency program,
        Watershed [Center for the Ceramic Arts], that is located there and also the\nHaystack
        School of Crafts, which has been around for sixty years or something now and
        so has\ngenerated public awareness. I\u2019m sure the people in Maine probably
        get some response from the\nBoston metropolitan area, but they are a little
        distance and I don\u2019t think Portland or the rest of\nMaine is such a huge
        population in the terms of what I\u2019m talking about that you need that
        city.\nThey have to be drawing from somewhere else, either these other various
        shops and things where\nyou can send your work to or Etsy. They might be marketing
        that way but not the kind of\ngeographic cohesion that we have here.\nAW:
        Geographic cohesion\u2014as in everybody focused on the St. Croix River Valley?
        Because\nwithin Minnesota there are definitely other areas in the pottery
        community.\nJK: I just meant that if we surveyed those people on the pottery
        tour, I would guess that some\nhuge percentage of their market is the Twin
        Cities. It is a major source for them. That\u2019s not to\nsay that they don\u2019t
        have shows elsewhere and other means of selling.\nAW: As you\u2019ve been
        researching pottery in the U. S. and also in Minnesota, what role did Red\nWing
        Pottery or places like that have in setting a tone or helping develop a certain
        taste for\npottery and ceramics and useful pottery? Has that come up at all?\nJK:
        My suspicion is that it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t hear people mention that
        in terms of sources for their\nown work or interests or discovery of pottery.
        I don\u2019t hear the makers say that. California is\nanother place that had
        a local pottery industry that lasted for a long time. My suspicion also\nwould
        be, and again I\u2019m speculating based on partial knowledge so I don\u2019t
        want to make big\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n21\nclaims
        about this, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that it isn\u2019t a different
        audience, more of an\naudience for Americana or for antiques or for that sort
        of thing. That they would go for Red\nWing or another comparable place because
        of its association with history. People now,\nsomebody who lives in the Twin
        Cities and decides that they are going to go on the pottery tour\nand they
        buy something, they are buying outside of the history. They are just dealing
        with some\nwork. Somebody really ought to analyze this. It\u2019s an interesting
        question \u2013 what is it that attracts\nsomebody to this today? I don\u2019t
        think, including myself among this population, that we are the\naudience for
        that. I wouldn\u2019t think that we\u2019re buying it out of some kind of
        nostalgia for an\nearlier time. I don\u2019t know how people discover this.
        I certainly couldn\u2019t say my own experience\nof stumbling into it is typical.\n01:34:15\nAW:
        Well, maybe that is a good opening. What was your first experience? What did
        you buy\nand why did you buy?\nJK: I had exposure to ceramics as a child but
        it was nothing that anybody would want to claim\ntoday. My father was career
        army and most of the army posts we would live on there would be a\ncraft shop,
        you know where you could go for hobby crafts. So you could pour slips into
        molds\nand it was all awful, kitschy things. I think I\u2019ve thrown away
        everything. My sisters and my\nmother and I all did that kind of thing. We
        would paint whatever came out. So I knew that there\nwas ceramics and that
        it was something somebody could do. As far as encountering this\nparticular
        phenomenon in Minnesota and deciding it was something that I responded to
        and that I\ndid want, it was Warren, again, talking to my special class at
        the U [University of Minnesota];\nthe magazine class. I don\u2019t think anybody
        in the pottery tour was in that magazine because it was\nso long ago.\nAnyway,
        exposure at that point and then a gallery I mentioned earlier, Sontag, on
        Grand Avenue\nin Saint Paul was showing a lot of work and I did meet people
        who are still working through that.\nI was not living here when the pottery
        tour started. I don\u2019t remember which was the first one I\nwent to, but
        it was a well-established phenomenon. I had the opportunity to be here at
        exactly\nthat time of year to take part of it. And by then I was already a
        confirmed ceramophile, or\nwhatever it is. For me it wasn\u2019t an example
        of going on the pottery tour and having an epiphany\nand saying, \u201cOh
        this wonderful stuff I\u2019m going to collect it\u201d. It wasn\u2019t like
        that. It was little\npieces here and there that prepared me for this opportunity.
        I always make the argument that one\nof the wonderful things about functional
        pottery, in particular, is that it\u2019s a place where you can\nbuy an aesthetic
        object that is interesting to talk about in any kind of art terms, but it\u2019s
        something\nthat a person of modest means can afford.\nThere used to be this
        big question about how you would write about a functional ceramic object.\nThey
        said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a bowl. What can you say about that? It\u2019s
        just a bowl.\u201d But if you\nreally look at things closely, if you look
        at a bowl really closely it has a landscape of texture. If\nyou really attend
        to it, the variations in glaze surfaces are like paintings. I mean if you
        really\nlook. It\u2019s an object that moves through space so it is sculpture.
        It\u2019s got everything that every\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n22\nother kind of art has, but you can still get one for,
        you know, twenty-five dollars if you are lucky.\nMaybe a little bit more than
        that. When you have that you can put it on your table and look at it\nevery
        day or it can be the thing that you use for your breakfast cereal. I like
        using them too but\nthere is a good thing about just setting it out there
        and looking at it. Treating it like it\u2019s an art\nobject. Then you begin
        to appreciate all the visual qualities and tactile qualities that it does
        have.\nBut, again, it\u2019s also just nice to use it.\nAW: Are there a couple
        pieces that stick out or a piece in your mind that you bought at the\nTour?
        Or acquired at the Tour?\nJK: I\u2019ve probably gone a half a dozen times,
        so there are quite a few times. You know the big\ncompetition is Northern
        Clay [Center]. It\u2019s hard to go in there and get through the sales gallery\nwithout
        getting anything. I try not to look! I can\u2019t buy something every time
        I go. So that\ncompetes a lot. The times that I\u2019ve gone on the Tour I
        started off small because at first when I\nwas going I was not living here
        so anything I\u2019d have to carry back to New York with me. So I\nbought
        little things and not too many and then it grows in time. You become fond
        of certain\npotters and you are interested in the changes they make so then
        you want to have a characteristic\npiece and you want to have a new piece.
        It just goes on and on. It grows on you.\nAW: Are there certain potters on
        the Tour that you really follow closely or that you\u2019ve collected\nsome
        of their materials?\nJK: Well, Jeff Oestreich would be the classic example
        because I bought his work when I was\nfirst being exposed to clay back in
        the seventies. As far as things that I\u2019ve bought on the Tour,\nit\u2019s
        not just the seven local people. The fact that this has multiplied to such
        an extent so I\u2019m\ncertainly buying things from people from all over the
        country. I particularly, I guess it\u2019s okay to\nsay this, I mean I\u2019m
        a critic and I\u2019m supposed to have a degree of impartiality here but I
        was\nonce on a panel at Northern Clay that was choosing, I think, the McKnight
        or one of the\nfellowships they administer and Will Swanson happened to apply
        that year. I remember being\nstruck by that because his is very modest, very
        un-showy, quiet pottery. Yet my sensation, which\nI still remember, I think
        that was the first time I ever saw his work, I just felt like I was in good\nhands.
        That this was someone who cared and who took care in a very kindly kind of
        serving way.\nNot the kind of egotistical artist that we might have a stereotype
        of a certain kind of creator.\nThat\u2019s not to say that I always buy his
        work or only buy his work by any means, but I have a soft\nspot in my heart
        because of that background.\nAnd then Bob Briscoe\u2019s work, just because
        it\u2019s so generous, you know, he\u2019s just a big hearty\nperson and a
        giving person who has been helpful to many, many people. You see the scale
        of his\nbowls, especially, big serving bowls, and it\u2019s like an embrace.
        You can just see him holding one\nof these giant bowls with food he\u2019s
        going to share with everybody. There is a whole kind of\nmystique associated
        with the size of those works. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to bring\nmyself
        to buy one of those biggest ones because of the expense, so I have smaller
        examples of\nhis work. Still, that\u2019s where the heart is. Not to play
        favorites, though, because I like lots of\nwork.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n23\n01:42:25\nAW: Would you mind sharing
        any comments or observations about the other potters\u2019 work and\nyour
        interaction with their work?\nJK: As history sort of?\nAW: Yeah.\nJK: Well,
        Richard Vincent I don\u2019t know at all. When I feel like I can\u2019t get
        to all the locations his\nis the one I always skip. I feel bad about it. I
        would rather go to every single one just to know\nwhat\u2019s there and what
        people are doing. So I\u2019m definitely not as aware as to who he regularly\nbrings
        with him as a guest. I don\u2019t think I had met, well, Bob came here after
        I left Minnesota, so\nI don\u2019t think I met him until I started going as
        a visitor on the tours. That\u2019s a fairly new\ninvolvement. Will and Janel
        were here and I remember her name from living here before, but\nagain, we
        hadn\u2019t met. So it\u2019s a relatively new acquaintance in that regard.
        Of course, now\nsometimes I\u2019m going to these various things [like the]
        SOFA [Sculptural Objects Functional Art\n+ Design] craft show in Chicago and
        places like that and Janel will be there with her wood, her\ncarving works,
        so she\u2019s not just a ceramic association. Connee Mayeron was around in
        the days I\nwas here and she was a participant in the Minnesota Crafts Council
        as well. But, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve\nhad a strong sense of her work.
        I haven\u2019t known about what she\u2019s doing at any given time in the\nway
        that I have Jeff Oestreich, for example. That may just be a consequence of
        where she shows\nor that sort of thing. Guillermo for me, of course, is a
        very recent acquaintance because he is the\nmost recent here. I think it speaks
        really well of him that he was invited to become a part of the\nTour as a
        new guy in town more or less.\nAW: Do you think some of that was his connection
        with Warren? He was never a student but he\nhad a connection with him.\nJK:
        Right, right. Well when he was still at his home in South America, Warren
        was a guest there\nand that\u2019s when he met Warren for the first time.
        Then, as a consequence of their acquaintance\nand Guillermo coming to visit
        Warren here he did meet other people. So he\u2019s ended up, I forget\nhow
        many of them, but definitely Linda went there and was a guest artist too.
        So they all had a\nfar deeper history with him then just the rest of the people
        around here. I mean he\u2019s relatively\nnew in terms of moving here but
        not in terms of connection with some people associated with the\nTour. Certainly
        that gave him a leg up. I don\u2019t think somebody could just move to Minnesota
        and\nbuy a studio someplace and expect to be included. They\u2019d sort of
        have to earn the trust, you\nknow? Earn their stripes or whatever. Who did
        I forget? Linda. I don\u2019t think I knew here before\neither, although I\u2019ve
        known her name for a long, long time. I don\u2019t remember meeting her long\nago.\n01:46:20\nA

        in your mind? Any you\u2019ve been really excited that they have been part
        of the Tour?\nJK: Oh yeah. When I was interviewing people for my pottery book
        and I would talk to other\npeople elsewhere. Some of them would say forlornly,
        \u201cI wish I could get invited to be there.\u201d So,\nI don\u2019t know
        how everybody has decided on their own guests. Jeff [Oestreich] has had one
        of the\nsmallest numbers of guests but he always has Pat [Burns] who was his
        apprentice at one point.\nShe now lives in Oregon and she and her husband
        both pot so they always get to be guests at his\nplace, but they are not as
        high profile as some of the other guests like Mark Shapiro, who comes\nto
        Will Swanson\u2019s. He\u2019s been a really interesting person with a kind
        of funny history of how he\ngot involved in clay, but he is very serious,
        you might almost say scholarly in his approach. He\u2019s\norganized a show
        of Karen Karnes, who is a major figure in mid-twentieth century functional\npottery
        and is still living. He\u2019s also particularly interested in a certain kind
        of New England folk\npottery; he has collected examples of that. He has a
        reputation as a serious person in other ways\nthan simply making. And his
        making also is quite thoughtful and interesting. He was a sculptor\nat one
        point, but he also seems to have a literary bent. So I think it\u2019s interesting
        and exciting to\nhave that whole different bundle of influences and interests
        come and be represented here.\nThere have also been a couple \u2013 and these
        are just sort of random associations that have popped\ninto my head. If I\u2019d
        seen a list I might have given you a more weighted and reasonable answer \u2013\nbut
        another person I was thinking of is Tom Turner who was also at Will\u2019s,
        but just once. He\u2019s a\nkind of porcelain specialist and has developed
        these oxblood red glazes and he\u2019s trying to do it\nso you can have that
        kind of a traditional looking glaze but by being able to do it in an electric\nkiln.
        He wants to do it chemically rather than through the fire achieving this effect.
        I\u2019m probably\nnot saying this very well because I\u2019m not a technician
        and I might not have the exact\nterminology right. Anyways, he was on the
        Tour not last year but maybe the year before or\nsomething like that, and
        didn\u2019t have a very good experience of it. His work is rather higher\npriced
        than the other people he was showing with. He might have been better off at
        Connee\u2019s\nwhere things have a higher average price. But it was also less
        functional and I had met him at\nthat time so we talked briefly and he said
        people kept saying \u201cWell you can\u2019t put flowers in it\u201d\nand
        \u201cHow would you clean it out?\u201d So those are not his considerations.
        He makes vessels not so\nthinking of function and so he ran into this audience
        prejudice here and didn\u2019t sell that well and\nhasn\u2019t come back.
        It\u2019s too bad because it\u2019s a perfectly worthy body of work, it just
        didn\u2019t suit the\naura that this tour has developed. Oh gosh. There are
        so many people who visit. Who else can I\nthink of?\nThere are a bunch of
        the North Carolina potters. Suze Lindsay, Donna Polseno, and people like\nthat
        who have a good market and a good response in their own region but have also
        fit in\ncomfortably here and have done well and come back.\n01:50:50\nAW:
        On the topic of North Carolina, so generally, what have they said about selling
        here and\nbeing here as part of the Tour in Minnesota? Compared to their audience
        in North Carolina it\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n25\nsounds
        like a similar audience, maybe functional work. Why are those two places kind
        of in sync\nwith each other?\nJK: Well, they both are definitely centers of
        functional work.\nAW: Have you noticed in just talking to them, have they
        made comparisons to what their\nexperiences are in North Carolina versus here?\nJK:
        Well, North Carolina doesn\u2019t have a single population center of the size
        of the Twin Cities,\nbut I guess people don\u2019t mind driving because most
        of the potters I know are over in Western\nNorth Carolina kind of clustered
        around Penland mostly or, I was going to say Asheville, but\nPenland is really
        the heart of it. So people come from Raleigh but also from Charlotte, so they\nare
        drawing from multiple areas, and Asheville has turned into a sophisticated,
        hipster town\nstrangely enough. So that is probably a market as well, although
        the numbers might not be so\ngreat, but if you add them all together it\u2019s
        a pretty good population. North Carolina, traditionally,\nwas just a place
        that had good clay, which is why you had so many potters there. A folk potter\nwould
        set up where he could get his local material. Well that doesn\u2019t have
        to be the case\nanymore. A lot of people don\u2019t use local clays. Certainly
        only a small segment are really\ninterested in preparing their own clay and
        having that kind of specific relationship to the place\nwhere they are. Just
        because there was clay there and there were folk potters there, and there\nwas,
        again Penland, a school for crafts. So people would come and teach and Penland
        and like\nthe beautiful area and set up there and the numbers would grow.
        I think it kind of works the same\nway here. Once you have a person like Warren
        who teaches and then his students are around and\nthey are doing work too.
        Then this becomes a center and it draws more at that point. I was trying\nto
        think if I could make some distinction between the kind of work that is characteristic
        of the\ntwo places and probably I really can\u2019t. There are examples in
        both of earthy, tactile work and\nalso more decorative painterly and more
        colorful. I\u2019m not sure I could make a wholesale\nseparation of the two
        areas. What else did you want me to address?\nAW: Well that was just kind
        of it. I mean there have been a lot of comparisons along the way in\ninterviews
        and with you about North Carolina so I just wanted to hear a little bit more
        if those\npotters feel they can come to Minnesota and have a really good response
        similar to what they\nwere having in North Carolina I was just curious about
        that.\nJK: Well there is the orientation to function, which you wouldn\u2019t
        get from everywhere. When I\nwas doing my pottery interviews I would say that
        there are four main areas where I could hit the\nlargest number of people
        doing functional work at once. One was Minnesota, another was North\nCarolina,
        another was Maine and another was the area around the Archie Bray Foundation
        in\nMontana. And the same thing has happened there. People have gone to the
        Bray, then ended up\nbuying a house and staying on in that area. Montana,
        for a low population state, has considerable\nceramic activity. Of course
        because that\u2019s where Peter Voulkos and Rudy Autio started out there\nat
        the Bray so there is that long of history. That was 1950, so there\u2019s
        that long of history of\nceramic activity there before he [Voulkos] went off
        to California. Rudy stayed in Montana and\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n26\ntaught so you had subsequent generations too. Although
        he was not primarily doing functional\nwork, he was primarily a sculptor in
        ceramics or other mediums.\n01:55:45\nAW: So what about the audience or audiences
        in North Carolina? How would you define the\nNorth Carolina audience?\nJK:
        Hmm. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I could say. There is a long,
        I mean, because the folk\npottery tradition continued there and there were
        some people vaguely associated with the pottery\nfamilies because there were
        multiple generations of the same family of folk potters, some people\nfrom
        those families began to collect and other people began to collect with a more
        historic\norientation. The Mint Museum [in Charlotte] had a fine collection
        of historic ceramic examples\nfrom North Carolina, so just anybody interested
        in the arts might have easily been exposed to\nceramics as a part of that.
        I remember going into the Mint, which by that time had already been\ndivided
        into a crafts and design building and then the old museum that had the traditional
        stuff in\nit. I remember walking through the traditional galleries and seeing
        this ceramic work and saying,\n\u201cwhose is that?\u201d And it was something
        from the early twentieth century, a guy I\u2019d never heard\nof. He had been
        an itinerant journeyman potter, you know, in the old, old days who had more
        or\nless in his old age set up his own pottery there and made very simple
        dark glaze, just beautiful\nforms that were really reductive. I mean looking
        at them as an art critic and contemporary person\nI was just, Ahhhh. Just
        amazed that somebody did work like that back then\u2014beautiful stuff. So,\nthere
        that is for anyone who is going to pay attention or stumble across. They do
        have, where\nJugtown pottery is located in Seagrove, there is a big population
        of old folk pottery sites and\nthen, I don\u2019t even remember the number,
        but just a huge number of potters just in that area.\nThat\u2019s kind of
        vaguely midway between Raleigh and Charlotte. So easily you can drive from\nboth
        those metropolitan areas to Seagrove. In fact there is even a road there,
        whatever the\nhighway number that has signs along the roadside that say \u201cPottery
        Highway\u201d.\nAW: That makes it pretty clear.\nJK: Maybe they should do
        that someplace in the St. Croix. You know maybe they should\ndesignate a section
        of the interstate or something as \u201cPottery Highway.\u201d They should
        think about\nthis as a promotional device.\nAW: Great idea.\n01:59:50\nWhat
        do you think the Tour has meant for the guest artists who come?\nJK: A lot
        of them seem to just be amazed that there is this enthusiastic audience here.
        That\nthey\u2019re not having to beat the bushes or having to talk people
        into it by saying \u201cYou should be\ninterested in this because--\u201d
        and give them a spiel. They\u2019ve just got this audience here now and\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n27\nthat\u2019s
        what is remarkable about it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten these terms
        more specifically from\nother people, but I hear in vague conversation that
        people get maybe a third of their year\u2019s sales\nout of this one event.
        So, it\u2019s a big deal for the people who get to participate. It\u2019s
        also that you\nare together there with the other potters; it\u2019s a social
        event. They all catch up with each other.\nWhen I was coming from New York
        I would see, not every time, but I did on occasion see other\npeople from
        New York who were here to see things. So the fact that it\u2019s become such
        an event\nand it\u2019s an opportunity to network, as well as to collect,
        it\u2019s just a nice thing to come to.\nAW: As we know the Tour is not a
        juried event. Is that unusual for this kind of event?\nJK: Well, since this
        is an artist-organized event, no. Essentially they are jurying among\nthemselves.
        We don\u2019t hear about it and they are not giving an award for anything,
        but anybody\nwho is going to be invited as a guest the host has to be thinking,
        this person is representing me,\nin a sense. If they invited somebody whose
        work is not very good it would reflect badly on them.\nIt would maybe make
        the audience less likely to come. It would make the other hosts unhappy.\nThat
        doesn\u2019t mean people haven\u2019t experimented. Bob had a woman from Scotland
        or someplace,\nand Tom Turner would be an example of that too; somebody doing
        interesting work that wasn\u2019t\nthe standard. Still, it was very high quality.
        It didn\u2019t work out for him but there doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe a problem
        with doing that. I think it is a jurying process but it\u2019s just a little
        more intuitive or a\nlittle more subjective to the hosts themselves. That\u2019s
        why I was so curious about what would\nhappen with this generational passing
        on. Did everybody on the Tour have to approve the person\nwho is buying the
        studio?\nAW: I don\u2019t know.\nJK: It\u2019s hard enough to sell in the
        first place, but if you have to be judged by the other six as well\nthen that
        is tricky. I think that means that each of them has to be really serious about
        this and feel\nthat they are upholding a standard of quality. We hope not
        just a standard of taste or a bias of\ntaste because there is good quality
        in all sorts of styles and appearances.\n02:04:00\nAW: What do you think about
        how the Tour will pass to the next generation? What do you think\nwill happen
        to it in the future?\nJK: I wonder. I don\u2019t know because there definitely
        are younger people. Jason Trebs, for\nexample, who shows at Bob\u2019s place
        and has been his apprentice, he would be a fine person to be\nthe next generation,
        but then it comes to does he want to live in the country? He now lives in
        St.\nPaul. Does he have the money to buy a studio out there? Linda [Christianson]
        tells the story of\njust practically cobbling together all kinds of things
        just managing to, living in houses that were\nbarely suitable for habitation
        in order to get a foothold. Now that was a long time ago. Things\nhave gotten
        more expensive. The great worry was that as the Twin Cities now has so many\nbedroom
        communities out as far as Forrest Lake, which is getting really close to the
        Tour. I think\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n28\nmaybe
        Jeff or somebody told me that there was some plan for a development out in
        the area\nwhere some of the Tour sites are located, but it was, maybe, in
        \u201808 when the economy tanked.\nSomething stopped it from happening. We
        have to hope now that gas doesn\u2019t get cheaper\nbecause if it does people
        would be more inclined to drive out that far and that would drive up the\nprice
        of all the land there. Then what future would there be in this? So the future
        of the Tour is\nkind of predicated on that land staying affordable.\nIn the
        U. S. it\u2019s really hard for anybody to set up a studio. England, for instance,
        has the Crafts\nCouncil there that has what they call start-up grants, I think,
        and it\u2019s for somebody who has\ngotten out of graduate school to help
        them buy the studio equipment they need to get going\nbecause it\u2019s a
        tremendous burden to have to come up with all that. Young potters have tended
        to\nkind of band together to share equipment in a shared studio space. There
        is a place like that in\nAsheville where four potters work out of the same
        studio but they also sell out of it. They all\nhave display areas in there.
        They\u2019ve worked it out so at least one of them has to be there all the\ntime
        so that the sales space is open. They\u2019ve managed to work that out. So
        if that is the\nbeginning way, how do you make the jump to having your own
        space? You either have to come\ninto some money, or, as I was interviewing
        people some of the well established ones told me that\ntheir parents gave
        them a mortgage. Their parents enabled them to buy a house that they would\nalso
        use as a studio. There\u2019s just no other way to do it. Unless you get an
        inheritance or you work\na long time and save a very long time. But when you\u2019re
        young, where are you going to come up\nwith the money to do that?\nSo, that
        means in terms of the future of the Tour, the tricky thing is somebody who
        is old enough\nto be well established enough, Guillermo is an exception in
        that he needed to relocate, but mostly\nif you get to that point in your career
        you\u2019re going to stay where you are. You\u2019re not going to\nmove your
        studio. The next person to be part of the pottery tour either needs to start
        out there or,\nit\u2019s a complicated issue. It\u2019s hard to see how it
        can work. I would say nothing ever stays the\nsame. The pottery tour isn\u2019t
        likely to last forever. Economic conditions, whatever, society is\ngoing to
        change and there will be some reason for another answer, but at this moment
        in pottery\neconomics, I guess you\u2019d call it, in twenty-first century
        America what they are doing seems to be\nthe best way.\nFor functional ceramics
        to be in a gallery doesn\u2019t really work very well because galleries have\nhigh
        overhead and they need to sell things for high prices. So that\u2019s not
        the good place for it to\nbe. And if you\u2019re just in a shop someplace
        then you don\u2019t have the particular opportunity they do\nto make individual
        objects that are special and that can be regarded as artworks in themselves.
        If\nyou\u2019re just selling in a shop that has racks full of similar stuff
        then you are closer to industry and\nyou\u2019re just producing a whole lot
        of things. For a studio potter, and the studio implies isolation\nor being
        alone in that endeavor, the best way right now seems to be to sell from the
        studio\nbecause then you don\u2019t have to be paying someone else fifty percent.
        So we want the Tour to last\nat this point at least until somebody figures
        out another way to make this economically feasible.\nThese guys just all need
        to keep working and keep living for another couple of decades! Give us\ntime.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n29\n02:10:10\nAW:
        Do you think that the personalities involved in setting up the Tour, the people
        who founded\nit and are part of the core group, the hosts, is there something
        unique about their personalities\nand way of doing this that has made it successful
        and can that be transferred? Can a new group\nkind of put that together? Is
        that something to think about too? That it really comes down to\nhaving someone
        like Bob who was able to organize and recruit everyone to be part of this
        tour\nagain and again until it really started getting going?\nJK: Well since
        I don\u2019t know either of the Richards then, I don\u2019t know what the
        dynamic was\nthere. They also had the advantage that Warren was in it at the
        beginning so that would draw the\ninitial crowd because his name was better
        known than anybody else\u2019s. As I understand it he\nwithdrew because he
        was getting too much attention and not the rest of the Tour. I don\u2019t
        know\nexactly what the story was but if so, that\u2019s also generous of him
        to try to give the floor to these\nnew speakers. So that\u2019s a particular
        strength here that there was somebody like that who could\nmentor the situation.
        I do think other places, like the area around Penland where there are a lot
        of\npotters, I mean most potters that I meet, if you want to make a rash generalization,
        they are good\nnatured, congenial; they are good people. You know? That question
        is whether you have\nsomebody with organizational skills and business orientation
        to look after the details and the\nability to work together as a group when
        it becomes a more complicated endeavor. I think you\nhave good hearts there,
        as long as somebody has the other kinds of skills. It could happen\nelsewhere.\nAW:
        Do you think that is something that can be passed on?\nJK: It would be good
        to think that you don\u2019t have to just do this with your five best friends\nbecause
        that would be pretty limiting. It just has to be somebody\u2019s work you
        respect and that\u2019s\nenough. If they\u2019re not all chummy the rest of
        the time, what does it matter? If the business\nassociation works to the benefit
        of all of them. I don\u2019t know the specifics enough in the other\ncities
        because I don\u2019t know all the involvement. I don\u2019t even know who
        started the one in Austin.\n02:15:00\nAW: Do you think, and this is something
        Bob [Briscoe] had brought up as well, that mentoring is\nreally the key to
        this transitioning to a new generation, as he is working with Jason Trebs?
        Do\nyou think if the host potters continue to find people they are mentoring
        and think, oh maybe you\ncould take on a role as a host eventually? Do you
        think that might be a method for passing it on\nand retaining some of the
        core values?\nJK: It is, but it still depends on the money. Unless some philanthropist
        decides to endow these\nplaces or buy the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour sites,
        and just let people pass them on. No, that\u2019s\nnot going to happen.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n30\nAW: What do
        you think is replicable for the future? In terms of values, or mission or
        goals? At\nthis point, having heard from everybody, they are wrestling with
        this now and trying to figure out\nhow this will work. Not only how but what
        will be passed on? Will it be the physical sites or will\nit be the philosophy
        and values of functional pottery? As you\u2019ve pointed out if the land price\nincreases
        that could really exclude a lot of people from settling there and then that
        regional\nlocation which has been so important to the identity of the Tour
        could go away.\nJK: Did they tell you, or, I was thinking that at one point
        there was somebody on the Tour who\nwas further away, who was further north.
        Or maybe they just thought that person could be in\nthere but then it was
        not geographically tight enough to really work as part of the Tour. The way\nthe
        Tour is now you can do it in a day, particularly if you don\u2019t know a
        lot of people and aren\u2019t\nconstantly stopping to talk you can get to
        all seven sites and get back to the city without great\nstrain. If they were
        more strung out, so you were really driving a longer distance, it would be\nproblematic.
        I think that issue came up at some point. Or maybe it was just discussed and
        they\ndecided not to do it. Bob would be the one that would know. Maybe I
        heard that from him.\nAW: Yeah, I think they had people kind of on either
        edge they were considering or were maybe\nalso considering being part of it
        in the very beginning and then decided not to and then they\nrealized that
        having all the studios in close proximity to each other and making it easier
        for\nvisitors to travel around was an important part of the success. I think
        they\u2019ve stuck to that.\nJK: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily imagine that
        the individual locations, that Bob\u2019s studio itself, must be\non the Tour.
        I mean they could do the Tour with six instead of seven. That could disappear.
        If the\nnumber gets down by a lot, then it makes it less of an attraction.
        Why drive all the way out there\nif you\u2019re only going to go to one place?
        You\u2019d have to be really dedicated. A certain number is\nreally useful.
        When you think about how he\u2019s got that studio, he\u2019s got everything
        there set up, he\ncertainly wants to pass that on to another potter. It would
        seem like such a crazy waste for it to\njust become a house or just a residence.
        In terms of the perpetuation, the legacy of the pottery\ntour, I don\u2019t
        necessarily see the individual locations being that important. I think it\u2019s
        just the idea\nthat these are people doing something that gives them great
        joy basically and that also serves\nothers serves a kind of greater public
        good. That they\u2019ve found a way to sustain that, that\u2019s what\nis
        important about it.\n2:19:55\nAW: Nicely put. You said a little while ago
        you were thinking through what it was about the\nopen-air kind of situation
        where visitors get to meet the artists themselves and buy their stuff.\nCan
        you reflect a little bit more about that? Why do you think that\u2019s attractive
        to visitors and\nconsumers of pottery?\nJK: I think it\u2019s attractive to
        a lot of people who don\u2019t even think of themselves as following art.\nThey
        think, Oh, art is some strange person that they don\u2019t have an immediate
        acquaintance with.\nYet, visiting an artist\u2019s studio is fascinating because
        you\u2019re getting a glimpse into another world,\na world of creativity I
        think lots more of us aspire to that creativity than actually live it. So

        to go, even though in most cases you\u2019re not going into the house of the
        person \u2013 Bob\u2019s used\nto be the exception because he would have food
        in the house and you would get into the one little\ncorner of it \u2013 you\u2019re
        not seeing intimately how they live, but you are seeing how they work and\nthe
        environment in which they\u2019re in.\nWhen you started saying this about
        \u201copen air\u201d I didn\u2019t know where you were going with the\nquestion
        at that point, but I was thinking that one of the years I went to the Tour
        when I was just\nvisiting here, I was staying with my daughter, well it must
        have been four years ago because my\ngranddaughter wanted to go with me and
        I said, \u201cOh I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to be gone all day\nyou
        might get tired\u201d you know, I tried to discourage her. Anyway, she did
        go with me and it\nworked out very nicely actually. Particularly Will and
        Janel, they raise rabbits so they pulled out\na baby bunny for her to hold.
        Then, she [granddaughter] had some money, ten dollars of her\nown, and she
        thought she was going to buy a piece of pottery. There is nothing really for
        ten\ndollars, but when Janel heard this she said, \u201cAnything on this shelf
        you can choose\u201d and she just\naltered the price so my granddaughter could
        buy it. Anyway that really wasn\u2019t my point, I got\ndistracted here. The
        point was that particular year there had been a horrendous amount of rain\nand
        everything was muddy, everyplace was muddy. When I was going, I thought they
        probably\nwouldn\u2019t get a very good turnout because it\u2019s going to
        be a mucky mess with all those dirt roads\nout there. But they had a great
        turnout. People still came. Just the idea of getting out, and maybe\nthat
        made it more of a funny story or more of an adventure. You know, wallowing
        in the mud\nand having your pants all splashed with stuff from getting in
        and out of the car. Open air in that\nsense makes it an experience. Not that
        I would wish it to be that way every year!\nAW: Yeah, how has weather affected
        the Tour? Have you ever seen less of an audience because\nof the weather,
        or is it always like you\u2019ve been saying, when it\u2019s rainy and muddy
        you still have\na lot of people?\nJK: Did that come up when talking with anybody?\nAW:
        Well everyone had a weather story, but I guess as a more general question,
        how do you\nthink weather affects the Tour?\nJK: Well it could apply to the
        [Minnesota] State Fair going on now too. If it\u2019s ninety degrees, do\nthey
        get fewer people? With high humidity do they get fewer people? I don\u2019t
        know. There\u2019s\nalways going to be those people who decide they are going
        to go and they are going to go no\nmatter what the weather is. Surely on a
        beautiful day, especially in the spring, when you want to\nget out, if the
        weather is good I would imagine it would bring them more of a crowd, but I
        don\u2019t\nknow. I have not noticed in the, however many I\u2019ve gone to,
        definitely maybe six or something\nlike that it always seems to be a good
        crowd. Even on Fridays when you think, why aren\u2019t these\npeople at work?
        You know? (laughs) I had the idea that I wanted to go on Friday so it wouldn\u2019t\nbe
        such a mob scene but whew, maybe just because it\u2019s the first day there
        are still lots of people\nwho come. They must take the day off. They\u2019re
        not all retired for sure.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n32\nAW:
        What is it about the Tour that you like? What do you like about going? Your
        own\nexperience \u2013 what is it that keeps bringing you back? Is it the
        open air, the adventure, the potters,\nmeeting them and talking with them?\nJK:
        Well, you\u2019d think that it would be that I like to see all these potters,
        a fair portion of whom\nI\u2019ve met before, but I think with me it\u2019s
        that I like the work. I like looking at work and I like\nhandling it. Sometimes
        I have to pretend like I haven\u2019t seen somebody because if I talk to\neverybody
        I don\u2019t get to look at the stuff. You know? You\u2019re trying to examine
        somebody\u2019s new\nwork and they show up and you\u2019re chit chatting.
        Under those circumstances I can\u2019t give the same\nattention to the object.
        I like coming home with a couple of new pieces so it\u2019s really the work.\nThat
        being said, I do look upon this as an institution here and it\u2019s an institution
        that I hope will\ngo on so I do think of my presence as a vote in favor or
        an endorsement as a contribution to there\nbeing a future to this event.\n02:26:10\nAW:
        Are there other pottery events in Minnesota that you make sure you get to
        every year or that\nyou hold as an attractive event for you?\nJK: The other
        kind of obvious bookend to this is the American Pottery Festival at Northern
        Clay\nwhich is coming up in just a couple of weeks. There\u2019s a big sale,
        there is lots of work there but\nthe day-to-day activities are more workshops
        and a lot of people demonstrating work. At first I\nthought, I\u2019m not
        a maker and I don\u2019t want to go to those, but it\u2019s actually not too
        bad sitting in on\nthose too because they talk while they are working and
        so you\u2019re still getting a glimpse of\nsomebody\u2019s character and what
        they\u2019ve been doing. There are also a lot of little slide talks that\nyou
        can go to as well if you want a background of some artist. So I like them
        both and I attend\nthem both, but I think there is something more special
        about the Tour, just because you are out\nand you are on the potters\u2019
        home territories. If I were introducing somebody here to the idea of\nparticipating,
        it would be the pottery tour that I would recommend first, then if you have
        an\nestablished interest you might want to check out the festival at Northern
        Clay. They both are\nbringing in artists from elsewhere, so in terms of being
        exposed to new people and new\ninformation and work, they both are really
        great in that regard. Which also helps to make a more\nsophisticated audience
        here. So you\u2019re not just dealing with the same couple of local people
        and\nthat\u2019s all.\n02:30:00\nAW: I think you have covered a lot of the
        stuff, and I think we\u2019re now just on the reflection\nquestions if that
        is okay. So what has pottery meant in your life?\nJK: Oh. This sounds like
        an essay subject. Ah, what would I say? Well, it has meant, let\u2019s say\nutility,
        art and community. Really from the first moment that I became aware of what
        was going\non here and involved in this, I mean, the community of people is
        really an issue. Even (laughs)\nthe way I\u2019ve gotten on Facebook. I have
        two Facebook sites, one is just family and really old\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n33\nfriends, a very small number, and
        then the other is sort of the public person, the writer and all\nthat. And
        what I find myself doing, I get friend-ed by people I\u2019ve never heard
        of or don\u2019t know\nanything about. Well, if someone\u2019s in ceramics
        I\u2019ll say \u201cyes\u201d, but if they are a painter I want to\nsee the
        work. I want to see if I should bother to friend this person. So pottery has,
        well ceramics\nin general, has so engrained itself into my experience that
        a ceramic artist is presumed friendly\nuntil proven otherwise.\nAW: Have you
        ever made pottery yourself? Or are you involved in crafts?\nJK: Not really.
        Other than that horrible hobby shop stuff when I was a child. I did, at one
        point,\ntake a class in hand building at a community college where I happened
        to be living at the time. It\nwas just because, that was after I had been
        living in Minnesota and we had moved on to Illinois,\nand that was just to
        have a little bit better sense about it, but I\u2019ve never even tried throwing.
        So I\nreally got interested in art visually and intellectually, I guess you\u2019d
        say. At that point I couldn\u2019t\nsee trying to pursue actually doing it
        because I already knew there was all this other work and I\nthought, why bother?
        There are all these other interesting things.\nAW: I think someone had mentioned
        that you do some craft making or production of some kind,\nnot in ceramics
        but in other areas?\nJK: I would say not so. In my life I used to sew, so
        I made clothes for my children and for\nmyself, but I haven\u2019t done that
        in years. I also used to embroider decoratively. I took a weaving\nclass once.
        I took a painting class once, but I\u2019ve not tried to pursue these things.
        I mean I\u2019m\ninterested in doing things. I am an avid gardener and I am
        a hands-on home repair person, but in\nboth cases I say I\u2019m best at things
        that don\u2019t take strength or skill and that just take dogged\npersistence.
        So that\u2019s what I do. I dig out honeysuckle stumps and stuff like that.
        I really think\nmy orientation is editing, which I have done in journalistic
        ways. I think I\u2019m much better at\nlooking at something that is already
        done and figuring out how to make it better or diddling with\nit rather than
        actual real creation of something new. I don\u2019t think I have a gift for
        that in much of\nanything that I can think about, I mean, even being an art
        critic, it\u2019s not like being a novelist\nwhere you make up a world. To
        be an art critic is to deal with something that already exists and\ntalking
        about it.\nAW: How do you see yourself in the recent history of ceramics in
        America? You\u2019ve been writing\nabout ceramics for several decades, so
        what do you think your role has been?\n02:35:00\nJK: Well, I think I got way
        lots of mileage out of the fact that I was a person at an art magazine\nwho
        was interested in ceramics. So I got lots of attention from the craft field.
        There was a time\nwhen I was first at Art in America I guess I\u2019d say
        that my coworkers there probably saw this\ninterest in crafts as, kind of,
        aberration. I don\u2019t know, slumming even. It wasn\u2019t anything that
        got\nme a job or got me credit in the art world, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s
        the case anymore. Particularly\nbecause of the widespread interest in clay
        in the art world in general and the fact that all these\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n34\npeople are dabbling in it
        just to find out about the material and the sense of touch. Also,\nsometimes
        because they\u2019re interested in function and trying to make functional
        objects. So,\nwhere was I going with this?\nAW: Well do you think you had
        a role in shaping an awareness about ceramics?\nJK: It would be nice to think,
        but I\u2019ve never really tracked how things came to attention. I mean I\nguess
        a writer about art always wants to think that. I\u2019ve been more interested
        in writing about the\nunderdog and the unknown and the emerging, and so I
        like to think that I brought attention to\nsomebody that then other people
        will recognize the validity of the medium or that particular\nartist. But
        I don\u2019t know if you can prove that and I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s
        going to put me on\nthe list of most influential writers. Well partly, maybe
        it\u2019s a female thing, but I have not been\nvery interested in just calling
        attention to myself and I can\u2019t do the performance kind of stuff\nwhich
        Garth Clark, for instance, is a master of carrying his audience. It\u2019s
        a skill, but it\u2019s not a\nskill that I have been interested in developing.\nI
        basically did all this for my own satisfaction, because I like looking at
        the work and because I\nsee better if I know I\u2019m going to write about
        something. I pay attention in some kind of a more\nacute way. I can go see
        a show in a museum and think that I\u2019m looking at it carefully and paying\nattention,
        but if I\u2019m not going to be writing about it I just don\u2019t have the
        acuteness of observation\nor the retention I guess either. So I like to write
        because that\u2019s my way of engaging with the\nobject and really experiencing
        whatever the artwork is, or the event, or performance, too. I guess\nI do
        know that the only time there have ever been articles in Art in America about
        jewelry I\nwrote them. Only twice that I know of and that\u2019s not an easy
        one, it was easier to get ceramics in.\nSo, you know, I hope that some more
        readiness to accept the great variety of aesthetic creativity\nthat we have
        in our culture, that it doesn\u2019t have to be just this narrow definition
        of painting and\nsculpture and photography and video and whatever else qualifies
        at the moment. I think that\u2019s the\nway things have been going in general,
        is to be more broadly accepting.\nI mean it used to be that nobody was interested
        in Latin American work, and multicultural art\ncoverage has been a broadening
        of the field for everybody, so I think this is just another little\ninstance
        of more receptivity to working in a different medium or with a different set
        of criteria\nthan there might have been at one time. Although there hasn\u2019t,
        just for the record, there hasn\u2019t\nalways been a bias against this work
        either. If you read early twentieth century art magazines\nyou\u2019ll find
        blacksmithing and metalsmithing gates, you\u2019ll find the whole spectrum
        of creative\nactivity at that time. So the narrowness, the bias, of thinking
        that art could only be one thing, was\njust a certain mid-century phenomenon
        that we\u2019ve gotten past now.\n02:40:00\nJK: I think probably the most
        important thing I\u2019ve contributed to the field is the Makers book.\nJust
        the fact that there is a history, I mean, I don\u2019t expect that to be the
        last word by any means\nbecause we had a hard time finding some of that history.
        That\u2019s also another thing that has\nchanged. The scholarly approach to
        this field has gotten better over the last several decades due\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n35\nin part to some older
        decorative arts programs but also some new ones, like the Bard [Graduate]\nCenter
        in New York, which is also a decorative arts program. So there are young scholars
        who\nhave come through those kinds of programs. Yale has also been, their
        art history program has\nproduced some of the younger scholars who are interested
        in contemporary crafts; textiles,\nceramics, wood, whatever it happens to
        be. There has been more of a sense of seeing that this is a\nhistory, a philosophy
        of work that is worthy of the same kind of exploration as painting or\nsculpture.
        So, you don\u2019t always have to say that the old times were better. I mean
        I actually think\nthe present times are better in this regard.\nAW: In terms
        of what exactly? What makes this time a better time for crafts or appreciation
        of\ncraft?\nJK: That things are not so narrow. That an artist can work in
        any way that he or she wishes.\nMuseums still have this problem with categories,
        you know they have their departments and\nsometimes it\u2019s a dumb fit.
        There are people who work in clay who are absolutely not decorative\nartists.
        They are just artists like any other contemporary artists. It\u2019s silly
        to say on the basis of\nmedium, that\u2019s one of the places where there
        seems to be a structural bias that presents a problem\nfor craft is in museums.
        Other than that I think a lot of barriers have fallen in scholarly and\ncreative
        activities. Anything that is persuasive in and of itself that persuades you
        of its\nearnestness, its attraction, its validity.\nAW: Anything else to add
        to the bigger question of what the Tour has meant for the hosts or for\nthe
        guest artists? You\u2019ve talked about this as an important source of income,
        as a source for\nsocializing and networking, and things like that. Anything
        else to add?\nJK: Well, I think the Tour founders in choosing Mother\u2019s
        Day weekend to do this were pretty\nsmart. I mean somebody else might have
        thought of that and there are probably other Mother\u2019s\nDay activities,
        you know, art fairs or other things like that. That has worked well, so that\nparticular
        timing has been adopted. The idea of getting out in the spring to do something
        like that\nand maybe the assumption that mother is the one more likely to
        want to do it and she can say,\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s my day, we\u2019re going
        to go on the Tour.\u201d Maybe there might be a kind of effect of the\nTour
        as a model in other senses. I can\u2019t give you evidence of this, but Mark
        Shapiro, who I\nmentioned is in Massachusetts, there\u2019s a four person
        kind of tour there or some sort of a group\nshow that goes on and he has had
        a couple of other people at his site when they do that. I don\u2019t\nknow
        the history or the timing but my guess would be that you could look at something
        like what\ngoes on in this studio tour and say, \u201cWell, I could do this
        on a smaller scale if I\u2019m having an\nassociated open day with a couple
        of other people I could also have guests come in.\u201d That might\nbe something
        that people had not so commonly done before. I\u2019m just guessing.\nOther
        important things, well, money and socialization both seem like really important
        things.\n02:45:10\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n36\nAW:
        Do you think it\u2019s really solidified their careers in a way over the decades?
        I mean some\ncame in pretty well established and I think for others they were
        getting established as the Tour\nstarted in the early nineties they were still
        in early-mid career.\nJK: I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t know if the Tour,
        certainly in a local sense the tour gives credibility.\nThe fact that this
        young man, Jason Trebs, shows on the tour with a lot of other people locally\nthat
        has to be an endorsement of his work that is important. I don\u2019t know
        if that has gained him\nanything nationally. I don\u2019t know if the ceramic
        magazines, they don\u2019t cover the Tour as a\nreporting activity, so people
        in other parts of the country might not even know who is doing it\nhere, so
        I\u2019m not sure that would contribute to anybody\u2019s standing in the
        field. Although if you\nread down a bio and they are showing here and you
        know that the Tour is an institution then that\nhas to be a good point. A
        feather in somebody\u2019s cap that they\u2019ve done that, but I think that\nbecause
        it\u2019s a local exposure instead of a national one that I can\u2019t quite
        imagine that it would\nmake anybody\u2019s reputation in terms of reputation.
        If they sell very well then that success carries\nthem on, but you just don\u2019t
        get national press for this. It doesn\u2019t get written up in the New York\nTimes
        or something. It could, sometime, why not? It would make a nice human-interest
        story.\nAW: Have other tours gotten written up, similar to this one?\nJK:
        Not that I know of.\nAW: Or are tours still, well, as you were talking I was
        thinking of something that Bob and others\nhave really appreciated is the
        Minnesota Public Radio\u2019s coverage of the Tour. They point to that\nas
        a great promotional opportunity.\nJK: But that was Minnesota, not national.
        Right?\nAW: Um-hm.\nI think there were a couple of years where someone was
        interviewed from the Tour about it. I\u2019m\nunsure how that all works, but
        they do definitely have some time on public radio and that seems\nto have
        been one of the big promotional activities that has really helped their tour\u2014along
        with\nthe color poster. Once they switched from a basic, black and white or
        maybe just a basic print\ntrifold brochure to a full color poster that seemed
        to double the audience.\nJK: That made a big difference? Very interesting.\nAW:
        Yes. Kind of these very simple promotion materials, but when done well all
        of a sudden\nyou can double or triple the audience.\nJK: I like the one where
        they are all sitting at the table. I actually use that in a talk that I\u2019ve
        given\nabout pottery. That\u2019s interesting to hear.\nAW: What do you think
        the Tour means for the broader Minnesota community?\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n37\nJK: Well, for anybody who knows
        about the arts in Minnesota, whatever your local specialty is,\nit [St. Croix
        River Valley Tour] is a point of pride. Certainly that has to have something
        to do\nwith that point of identification of the character of the state. But
        in saying that, I think there are\nprobably plenty of people who just go hunting
        and fishing and stuff and don\u2019t know anything\nabout there being pottery
        here. I\u2019m not sure and I don\u2019t have any reason to think that the
        average\nMinnesota citizen would even know that this existed. I think it\u2019s
        within a selected, either\nspecifically art-oriented, or just the people who
        like to, you know, just the kind of people who\nwant to go to the national
        parks and just check out the things that are exceptional. Then when\nyou have
        this kind of an event they would be somebody who was aware of that and be
        glad to\ncheck it out. Unfortunately, in our whole culture at large, I think
        the support of art is still a pretty\nspecialized activity. Even though nearly
        everybody has some kind of creative thing that they do,\neven if it\u2019s
        working on their cars or tying flies or whatever.\n02:50:46\nAW: Or gardening?\nJK:
        (laughs) Yeah.\nAW: So, as a wrap up question, what is the state of ceramics
        today, thinking about Minnesota\nspecifically?\nJK: In the nineties, right
        at the end of the century, I think there was a sense in the crafts field,\nyes,
        I think I\u2019m right saying in crafts and not art as a whole, a feeling
        that things were just kind\nof weakening or petering out. That there had been
        this huge blossoming of the crafts starting in\nthe sixties with the baby
        boom generation and that they were all getting older and that the college\nteaching
        programs were shrinking and that, oh dear, everything\u2019s on the downhill
        slide. Then all\nof a sudden you get into this new century and things, all
        sort of surprising things come up, like\ndigital printing. That kind of surprise,
        and it seems to me that there has been a lot of creative\nactivity in all
        the crafts fields within the last decade, within this century.\nI also, well
        part of the reason I wanted to work on this pottery book was that I had a
        feeling that\nthe ceramics field at large was finding more acceptance as either
        figural sculptures or as vessels,\nwhich were not functional but are sculptural
        vessels. And that the ceramics field itself was a little\ndown on function
        and thought it wasn\u2019t very important. They were swallowing the old kind
        of\nmind poisoning stuff from the art world. I wanted to work on this because
        that\u2019s not my\nperception of how it is at all. I see lots of creative
        work, [artists] making new forms of ceramic\nwork that are still utilitarian.
        And gosh, I interviewed a hundred and sixty people and stopped\njust because
        I have twice as many as I can possibly deal with in this book. Even so, I
        keep\nstumbling across another person thinking, oh, why didn\u2019t I meet
        them sooner, why didn\u2019t I see\nthat work sooner, because it\u2019s absolutely
        of a caliber that I would wish to consider. So, you\nknow, I feel that there
        are all kind of riches of great work going on; all kinds of things being\ndone.
        Back to Garth Clark again. Did I mention this last time? I can\u2019t remember.
        He only went to\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Koplos\n08\/20\/14\n38\nNorth
        Carolina like a year ago or something and he had never been there before and
        so now,\nsuddenly, this guy who is quite influential in the field and had
        been saying all these negative\nthings, the kind of \u201cnobody can make
        a living as a potter\u201d that kind of rigmarole, and he met\nplenty of people
        in North Carolina. I don\u2019t know if he has ever been here. Maybe he should
        get\ninvited. So, now he\u2019s talking about function as a legitimate expression
        today. I just think the\nwhole stigma, or uncertainty maybe, about the status
        of that kind of work is dissolving. I think it\nis a great moment. It\u2019s
        exciting. It also has that potential we already discussed that there is a\ngenerational
        change operating, so, it has to work its way out somehow.\nAW: Is there anything
        else you want to add about the Tour?\nJK: Have you got food in there?\nAW:
        You\u2019ve mentioned it a little bit. Do you want to say a few words about
        that? Many others\nhave talked about that as well so it would be good to hear
        your perspective.\nJK: I actually think that\u2019s part of this sense of
        welcoming and socialization, the fact that there is\nfood there. I keep wondering
        how the individual people who do it can possibly afford to provide\nthat stuff.
        Well, maybe they can\u2019t because Bob [Briscoe] pulled back on that this
        year and Jeff\n[Oestreich], as well, had a food truck there. And I don\u2019t
        have any idea how those worked,\nwhether they made enough money to make it
        worth while as a food truck. But just the sense of\ninclusiveness, it makes
        it more of a kind of party atmosphere that here is this stuff that you can\nshare.
        You don\u2019t have to pay for everything, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re
        just coming to take the money\nout of your pocket. Like you feel with the
        airlines nowadays where every time you turn around\nthey\u2019re going to
        charge you for something again. This is just cordiality and welcoming. I think\nit\u2019s
        very nice that they have done that and I hope that they can manage to continue
        to pull it off.\nYeah, that\u2019s it. The end?\nAW: Yes, that\u2019s a very
        nice note to end on. Thank you very much for your interview. We\u2019ll end\nhere.\n02:56:48\nEND

        00:00:00\nAW: This is Andy Wilhide interviewing Warren MacKenzie on July 18,
        2014, in Stillwater,\nMinnesota, at his home and studio at 8695 68th Street
        North, Stillwater, Minnesota. This\ninterview is for the A Measure of the
        Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River\nValley, made
        possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grants. Also present\nduring
        this interview is Tierney McNabb our project assistant. Warren, thank you
        so much for\nagreeing to be interviewed. Why don\u2019t we get started? If
        you could tell us about where and when\nyou were born? Where you grew up?\nWM:
        I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1924. My father was a traveling salesman
        and he\ngot transferred around a great deal so we moved from Missouri to Philadelphia
        and then a few\nyears later to Chicago, Illinois. We never lived in big cities.
        We always tried to live in a suburb.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n2\nIn Chicago we lived in a little town called Wilmette,
        which is north of Chicago on the lake. It\nwas there that I got involved with
        art really seriously. I was lucky because I had an art teacher\u2014I\ntried
        for a scholarship at the Chicago Art Institute, but I was going to be a painter
        in those days.\nEveryone who did anything in art was going to be a painter.
        Nobody thought about metal work\nor ceramics textiles or anything\u2014it
        was all painting. I tried for a scholarship and didn\u2019t get one. I\ndid
        get one to another art school, but my teacher advised me that it wasn\u2019t
        a very good art school\ntherefore I should get to the Chicago Art Institute.
        My parents agreed to finance the first year but\nfinancing the first year
        in those days was very inexpensive. It cost four hundred dollars for\ntuition
        and all the necessary things I needed to go to school. They financed me for
        the first year\nand I was lucky to get a scholarship for my second year but
        always with the anticipation that I\nwas going to be a painter.\nThen I got
        drafted into the army in the Second World War. In the army I never saw combat\nbecause
        right after I was drafted and put into training as a truck driver a group
        of us were called\nto the general\u2019s office; the only thing that we could
        think of that was in common was that\neveryone has something about art in
        their background. It wasn\u2019t only art\u2014one guy was a sign\npainter,
        another guy was a house painter, but anything with paint. Anyway, what happened
        was\nthat the drafting of soldiers had become so rapid that the government
        printing office could not\nkeep up with printing instruction manuals and that
        sort of thing. They decided to start some small\nprinting workshops in various
        areas of the country. I was down in Fort Hood, Texas, and they\ndecided to
        make one there. We did make this workshop and I worked there all during the
        war\nuntil the Battle of the Bulge. When the Battle of the Bulge came along,
        everyone who was\nnoncritical to the Army was reassigned. We went through
        re-training and we were to go to\nFrance and relieve those soldiers or help
        fight the Battle of the Bulge. Well I had checked in all\nmy materials and
        was ready to go home on a two-day leave before reporting to the port where
        we\nwould ship out. The sergeant called me back and said, \u201cYou better
        pick up all your gear because\nyou\u2019re not going.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d
        He said, \u201cYour eyes are too bad.\u201d Without my glasses I cannot\nsee
        at a long distance. I would have been a danger to my own comrades. I was put
        back into a\nshop printing and so on and did that for the rest of the war.
        When the war was over they took all\nof us who were nonessential again and
        shipped us overseas to replace the guys who were\nfighting. I was lucky; I
        was sent to Japan. While in Japan I met a lot of Japanese artists and so on\nand
        gallery owners. We didn\u2019t have much money but what we could buy that
        was available were\nJapanese prints and so we bought Japanese prints and so
        forth. That was the end of my army\ncareer.\n00:06:30\nI went back to school
        when I was released finally and I thought, Ok I\u2019ll pick up my painting\nstudies.
        I went to the Chicago Art Institute and I said, \u201cI want to re-register
        for my painting\nclasses.\u201d They said, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, there is
        no room in the painting classes,\u201d because all the\nreturning GIs were
        taking advantage of the G. I. Bill of Rights and if they wanted to they went
        to\nschool, and many of them went to art schools because there were a lot
        of artists it so happened. I\nsaid, \u201cWell, if painting is not open, what
        is open?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, you could take fashion\ndesign or ceramics.
        Both of those are open.\u201d I said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll take ceramics
        and eventually\nI\u2019ll finish my painting instruction.\u201d I got into
        the ceramics class and, I have to be honest with\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n3\nyou, we found out it was not a good
        ceramics class. The Art Institute of Chicago was a great\nschool for painting,
        not ceramics, at that time. It\u2019s since changed and it has a very good
        ceramics\nprogram now, so I don\u2019t want it to sound like I\u2019m damning
        the Art Institute for all time. But\nanyway a group of people were in this
        class and we were told what to do. We would spend three\ndays making a pot
        with coils of clay and the closer it came to an industrial pot the better
        the\ninstructor thought it was. One day one of the students came running into
        the class and she was\nwaving a book she had just bought and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve
        got this book. It\u2019s by a man named\nBernard Leach, a British potter,
        and it tells how he started out and it\u2019s much better than what\nwe\u2019re
        doing.\u201d Fortunately the instructor in the ceramics class was there only
        three days a week,\nso on the other four days we could get into the ceramics
        studio and try to do what Leach said was\nthe way to make pots. We did that.\nIt
        was there I met my first wife. She was also in the ceramics class. She was
        there because she\nwas teaching in a Mexican settlement house on the west
        side of Chicago. She thought that the\nkids would be more excited by mucking
        around with clay than they would by drawing with\npencils, which was all they
        had. She took ceramics although she was a painter, also. That\u2019s\nwhere
        I met her and we got married.\n00:10:00\nWhen we got out of school we tried
        to set up a pottery; disaster, absolute disaster. We finally\ndecided we needed
        more training and we wrote to Bernard Leach, told him our background, and\nasked
        if we could apprentice at his studio. He said, \u201cWell, I really have to
        see what you do and\nI\u2019d like to meet you.\u201d So we managed to save
        up enough money to get a cheap flight to England\nand we met Leach and we
        took some of our work with us and showed it. Of course, the first\nthing he
        said when he saw our work, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re full up.\u201d
        (Laughs) This really knocked us\nout for a while, but we had a week\u2019s
        reservation in a bed and breakfast so we asked if we could\ncome up everyday
        and watch what was doing and talk to the people who were working there and\nso
        on and perhaps learn as much as we could. He said, \u201cThat was fine,\u201d
        and we did that and we\ndid learn a lot. At the end of the week Bernard said,
        \u201cWe\u2019re firing our large kiln this weekend\u201d\u2014\nhe was still
        sitting a kiln watch. It was an oil-fired kiln, a three-chamber\u2014what\u2019s
        called a\nNoborigama\u2014which one chamber feeds into the next and into the
        next and out the chimney.\nBernard said he was still sitting a kiln watch
        and did we want to come up and talk because it\nwould be our last chance to
        visit with him. Of course we said, \u201cYes.\u201d He then told us his kiln\nwatch
        was from 1:00am to 4:00am. That didn\u2019t stop us. We went back and took
        a nap and then\nwalked up to the pottery at 1:00 o\u2019clock. We talked from
        1:00am to 8:00am. We never talked\nabout pots, which is the interesting thing.
        All I can say is that Leach wanted to find out what kind\nof people we were.
        We talked about economics, we talked about social problems, government\u2014\neverything
        that came up we just chatted over it. At the end of that time he said, \u201cI\u2019ve
        changed my\nmind. You can come back and work in the studio.\u201d\nWe had
        to go back to America because we had a commitment to teach in a little art
        school in St.\nPaul, which we had been teaching at. We went back and taught
        and then returned to England and\nwe stayed for two years. We were very lucky;
        Leach had been in America giving a series of\ntalks, lectures, and we knew
        that he was here and we arranged to go on the same boat with him\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n4\ngoing back to England.
        We spent six wonderful days talking about anything that came to our\nmind,
        and pottery was certainly top in those discussions because he had already
        accepted us.\nWhen we got to Southampton, Bernard said, \u201cDo you have
        a place to stay?\u201d We said, \u201cNo, but\nwe\u2019d find a bed and breakfast.\u201d
        And he said, \u201cDo you want to live with me?\u201d He had just\ndivorced
        his third wife and couldn\u2019t manage to live alone. He couldn\u2019t stand
        living alone because\nhe\u2019s a very communicative person and he always
        has to have someone to test ideas off and so on.\nSo we lived with him for
        two years and that was really great. We got to know him. We got to see\nhis
        whole collection. We got to use the pots in the house for meals. At the end
        of that time,\nLeach knew that we were going to try and start our own pottery
        and so he encouraged us to come\nin on the evenings and weekends and make
        our own work in the studio, which was fired in the\nkiln. We encouraged some
        of the other young guys who worked at the pottery to do the same\nthing. Eventually
        we had a big show of all the pots, which we\u2019d made all together. It was
        fun. It\nwas not a great success but it was fun.\n00:15:50\nWe returned home
        and we went back to St. Paul. We went back and were teaching in this little\nart
        school, which is not a very good school, but trying to get out of it. I kept
        asking the\nUniversity [University of Minnesota] if they had an opening in
        their art department. It so\nhappened that the University was revising their
        art department and there was a man in charge\nwho had been given the authority
        to hire anyone he wanted without doing a nationwide search,\nthe way they
        have to do now. He had seen our work from when we had been working in St.
        Paul,\nand it was better than what the woman who was teaching there was doing.
        He said, \u201cThere is this\nwoman, but she\u2019s on her way out.\u201d
        She was a Bauhaus trained person, but the Bauhaus didn\u2019t\nhave a ceramics
        section. She wasn\u2019t trained at the Bauhaus, she was trained at the School
        of\nDesign in Chicago, and that was run by Moholy-Nagy who was trained at
        the Bauhaus and was\npart of the Bauhaus in Germany. Her method of teaching
        we have to talk about. All the students\nbrought in a square paper milk carton
        and they filled it with plaster of Paris. When it hardened\nthey peeled off
        the paper and then they took chisels and files and knives and so on and tried
        to\ncarve this block of plaster into a ceramic form. After they did that they
        made a mold around it\nand then they slip cast pots in that mold. They had
        two glazes they could use\u2014one was white\nand one was black. This really
        didn\u2019t sit well with the American students. She managed to drop\nthe
        enrollment from three full sections of twenty-four students each to one section
        of about five\nstudents. That was why she was on her way out. He offered me
        the job and I, of course, was very\nhappy to have it. He also said, \u201cIf
        there\u2019s a cut in the budget, or if you do not raise the enrollment\nof
        the classes, then you\u2019re out.\u201d But that was better than what I was
        doing at the time so I said,\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll take the chance.\u201d The
        classes did go up and they didn\u2019t get a cut in the budget, so I was\nthere
        for the rest of my teaching career.\n00:19:00\nEventually things happened.
        My wife died while I was teaching there. We had two children. We\nwere living
        in an apartment in St. Paul. Wait a minute; I\u2019m missing something here.
        When we\ncame back from England I got this job teaching at the University
        but we wanted to start our own\npottery. We knew we wanted to have a big kiln
        like they had at the Leach pottery. It would\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n5\nprobably be oil-fired because that
        was the only kiln we had fired with. We had two choices\u2014if\nyou want
        to have a big kiln with black smoke coming out of the top there\u2019s two
        places where you\ncan work: you can work in the country or you can work in
        the industrial section of town. We\nchose the country and we managed to find
        the place\u2014where I\u2019m still living\u2014in an ad in the\nnewspaper.
        We did buy this place. It\u2019s much more than we need because it had a home
        on it\u2014at\nleast a primitive house, a simple house. It had a garage. It
        had a machine shed. It had a big barn\nwhere we could convert it to a studio.
        It had forty-five acres of land, which is more than any\npotter needs. In
        fact, it\u2019s too much. We bought it and we got it for practically nothing
        at that\ntime; this was 1953, just after we returned from England. Anyhow,
        we moved out here and we\nstarted our pottery. We were pretty successful and
        after that I did switch over to the University\nteaching. I must say teaching
        in a University is a great thing because you do have an audience\nwho are
        receptive to ideas. I think that was probably what really got things started
        here around\nSt. Paul\/Minneapolis because a lot of people were very excited
        about learning to make functional\npottery, which we were determined we were
        going to make\u2014not art, but functional pottery. We\nhad a lot of students
        and they in turn went out and taught in other schools, locally here, and that\nwas
        where the beginning of things that were really happening in St. Paul occurred.
        When we first\nmoved to St. Paul there was one other potter and she was the
        wife of a professor in Hamline\nUniversity. She was stuck with the idea that
        she had to make pots out of clay that she dug\nherself. The only clay that
        she could find around St. Paul was a brick factory across the river\nfrom
        the city of St. Paul, where she got lots of clay but it was great for bricks
        and no good for\npots. She struggled with that and kept at it all the time
        that we knew her, but the pots would warp\nand crack and do all sorts of nasty
        things. She was not a great influence on the surrounding\nneighborhood, but
        we were good friends.\nAfter my wife died I stayed on here and I got kind
        of fed up working alone. I tried taking on an\napprentice and I got a very
        good man who was an apprentice two years with me. He did his own\nwork; he
        didn\u2019t do my pots but he did his pots. But he helped out in the studio
        mixing the clay,\npacking the kiln, and firing the kiln, all those things.
        The only thing was that I was not geared to\nworking with someone who I was
        not familiar with in the same room. When he left after two\nyears I never
        had another apprentice. But then I got to be kind of lonely for contact and
        talk and\nso I had the idea and I got to know a lot of well-known potters
        around the country and I would\nask them if they would come for a week in
        the summer. They would all work here and we\u2019d pack\nthe big kiln and
        fire the pots and then have a giant sale in the yard where everyone\u2019s
        work was\nout for sale. I think that\u2019s the closest I come to a beginning
        for what eventually became the St.\nCroix Valley Pottery Tour. I was never
        involved with it, but I think people took the idea of a\ngroup of people gathering
        their work together and getting a larger audience that way. I believe it\nwas
        Bob Briscoe who actually started the St. Croix Pottery Tour. I was not a part
        of that because\nI could sell all my work that I wanted here in the studio.\nOver
        the years also, I\u2019ve gone to other countries and given workshops that
        have varied in length\nfrom a couple of weeks to a couple of months. At one
        of them I met a man in Venezuela, and he\ndecided he had had enough of the
        politics in Venezuela and he moved to America and he lives\njust north of
        Stillwater and is a very good potter. His name is Guillermo Cuellar. I think
        you,\nperhaps, have met him? He\u2019s a wonderful potter. He\u2019s a key
        person in this St. Croix Pottery\nTour. Now, do you have any questions that
        I haven\u2019t covered? I\u2019ve been talking nonstop.\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n6\n00:26:50\nAW: I do have
        some follow-up questions. When you moved to St. Paul that was right after
        you\nfinished at the Art Institute of Chicago? Is that right?\nWM: That\u2019s
        right. We had been in Chicago and we had tried to make pots in Chicago but
        we\nneeded a small job\u2014and we were attracted by the Walker Art Center.
        It\u2019s ironic that the Walker\nArt Center at the time that we were looking
        for a job, they were very interested in utilitarian\nobjects as artwork. In
        fact they had a whole section in a publication called The Everyday Art\nQuarterly
        and the Everyday Art section of the museum. We, in looking for a place to
        work,\ncontacted three or four places similar to that. They were the only
        ones who responded to our\ninquiry and asked us to come up and we did. They
        said, \u201cWe have closed our school and don\u2019t\nhave a school but we\u2019ll
        find you a job.\u201d So they found us a job at another little art school
        in St.\nPaul so that\u2019s what brought us to St. Paul in the first place.\nAW:
        What was the name of that art school?\nWM: I won\u2019t get sued for libel?
        It was the St. Paul Gallery and School of Art on Summit\nAvenue. It was in
        an old mansion, which had been an art school for some time. We lived in the\ncarriage
        house behind it. We were able to build a studio to teach ceramics.\nAW: What
        were the schools like then in the Twin Cities? How many offered ceramics programs?\nWM:
        There were no schools that we knew of that offered ceramics or that really
        concentrated on\ncrafts. There were painting schools around and through the
        colleges and all but not concentrating\non the crafts, except for the Walker
        Art Center, which at that time was very much interested in\ncrafts and brought
        us up. But now the Walker Art Center has changed its direction and they\u2019re
        no\nlonger interested in anything that looks like crafts. Unfortunately we\u2019ve
        lost a major museum for\nsupport. On the other hand, the Minneapolis Art Institute
        has increased their interest in the crafts\nand they\u2019ve got a lot of
        craftwork is shown in their museum.\nAW: Are there other organizations that
        support the crafts communities in the Twin Cities?\nWM: I must say that I
        lived a very isolated life. I taught at the University and I worked here and
        I\ndidn\u2019t know a lot of the other things that were happening around here.
        I can\u2019t say that I was very\ninvolved.\nAW: You said that you and Alix,
        your first wife, you were teaching and had started a studio but\nyou said
        it didn\u2019t work out very well. Was that in part the audience here? What
        was it like to sell\nyour pottery here in the Twin Cities? This would have
        been--?\n00:31:30\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n7\nWM:
        We had great support from the Walker Art Center. We had a major exhibition
        over at the\nArt Center, and that did us proud. We were very lucky with that.
        I can\u2019t tell you all the history of\nthis because it\u2019s not relevant,
        but the director of the Art Center was let go and the new director\nwasn\u2019t
        interested in craftwork at all. Then I concentrated on the University.\nAW:
        When you started selling your own pottery, would you also have shows for the
        general\npublic?\nWM: We sold any way we could. (Laughs). In fact, when we
        first came to St. Paul we found\nnobody was very much interested in crafts
        except the Walker Art Center. We did everything to\nbring people to our studio.
        We would encourage groups like the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, that\nsort
        of thing, to come and we would give demonstrations and lectures to them. We
        had an open\nhouse every weekend on Saturday where the studio was open to
        anyone who wanted to wander\nin. Through the school, which we happened to
        work with\u2014they had the Winter Carnival and the\nschool where we were
        working was asked if they would design various windows for various\nstores
        in order to attract people\u2019s attention. We were working on that and in
        one of the stores\u2014\nI\u2019ll never forget\u2014my wife was making pots
        in the store window. It didn\u2019t say anything about the\nWinter Carnival
        but it attracted people\u2019s attention to the store and that was all the
        store cared\nabout.\nAW: What store was that?\nWM: It wasn\u2019t the biggest
        one, it wasn\u2019t Dayton\u2019s\u2014in fact, Dayton\u2019s didn\u2019t
        have a store in St.\nPaul at that time. What was the name of it? I can\u2019t
        remember.\nAW: What time was this? When did you graduate from the Art Institute
        of Chicago?\nWM: I came back from the army in 1946 and I graduated about 1948
        and that\u2019s when we\napproached the Walker for a job and we were brought
        up.\n00:35:00\nAW: And you were in St. Paul for how long before you went to
        England to visit Leach and his\nstudio?\nWM: About 1950.\nAW: At that time,
        what was the general public\u2019s idea of pottery? What had they been exposed\nto?
        How did they view pottery?\nWM: An example: the Walker Art Center\u2014they
        were not a craft museum but they had one\npermanent exhibition, which showed
        how pots were made. They had examples from all over the\nworld and that was
        a permanent exhibition showing how pots were made. We got into it because\nthey
        had a shop that sold things and so they sold our pots at their shop. It worked
        out well. We\ndid get some exhibitions at galleries around town, but to tell
        you the truth, I can\u2019t remember the\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n8\nnames of them. There was one in St. Paul. The guy
        was a painter and he ran a gallery and he\ngave us an exhibition. Then there
        was one over in Minneapolis\u2014it\u2019s still going, the Groveland\nGallery.
        We showed there once.\nAW: How did the community in the Twin Cities compare
        to the arts community in Chicago?\nWhen you first moved, what were some of
        your first impressions of the area?\nWM: The Twin Cities was much less interested
        in art. The Chicago Art Institute is a very\nwonderful museum and they had\u2014at
        that time and still do\u2014a broad selection of work. We were\nlucky, also:
        in our schooling studying to be a painter, we had a marvelous art history
        teacher. She\nwas so opinionated because she wanted to encourage experimentation
        and all that sort of thing.\nShe was teaching art history\u2014I\u2019ll never
        forget\u2014in a big auditorium and she had slides she put\non various things
        she wanted to talk about. If a slide was up, it might be part of what she
        was\nmoving toward but if it wasn\u2019t something she liked she\u2019d just
        leave it on for a second and then\nsay, \u201cNext slide please.\u201d She
        wouldn\u2019t say anything about it. We had marvelous painting\nteachers in
        the art school. There was a man named [Robert] von Neumann, a German painter.
        He\nwas wonderful because he never let you know how he painted. He was a very
        conservative\npainter, but he was the most wonderful teacher because he would
        come up and stand and look at\nwhat you\u2019re doing and say, \u201cWhat
        are you trying to do?\u201d If you didn\u2019t have an answer he\u2019d\nsimply
        turn around and walk away. If you told him what you were trying to do then
        he was so\nfull of knowledge and where you should look, \u201cHave you thought
        about looking at this? And\nthat?,\u201d which was connected with what you
        were trying to do. He was concerned with advancing\nyour career and your knowledge
        rather than putting forth his own ideas. He was a great teacher.\nAW: Who
        was the art history teacher?\nWM: Her name was Kathleen Blackshear. She was
        the assistant teacher who wrote a book\u2014the\nfirst art history teacher
        I had was Helen Gardner. She wrote a book about art history; it was a\nvery
        popular book about the history of art. Kathleen was her assistant and when
        Helen retired she\ntook over as the main instructor.\n00:40:45\nAW: What did
        you like about your teachers in Chicago?\nWM: The ones that I got were not
        by design but by chance because you\u2019re taking a certain level\nof painting
        class and there were only three or four teachers teaching that and you were
        just\nassigned someone. The first teacher I had there, he was wildly enthusiastic
        about painting. He\nwould arrange all sorts of things to see where the students
        were going, and there were different\nsorts of set-ups of a model or still
        lifes. He\u2019d take us out painting in the streets for scenery out\nthere.
        He was a wonderful teacher. I had a marvelous teacher who taught design. This
        man was a\nreally crazy guy. He taught design in the broadest sense of the
        word and encouraged all sorts of\nexperimentation, which I think is critical
        to a good teacher. I can\u2019t remember his name. I wish I\ncould.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n9\nAW: What got you
        into painting? Why did you pursue painting in the beginning?\nWM: From the
        time I was a young kid I was interested in art and my parents encouraged it.
        They\ndidn\u2019t send me to school for art or anything like that but they
        just let me draw on everything.\nThrough them then I met people who were interested
        in art and teaching. They helped and helped\nencourage me. So I thought, when
        I was about ten years old, I\u2019m going to be the greatest artist in\nthe
        world. But of course I never was. (Laughs)\nAW: Well, you\u2019ve done a lot
        in the world of ceramics. Before going to the Chicago Art Institute\nwere
        there any mentors in your life or artists that influenced you?\nWM: There
        were teachers in my school. My parents, I told you, whenever they were transferred\nto
        another town they never would live in the city; they wanted to live in the
        suburbs. This\nindirectly led to very good schools, most of the time. When
        we lived in Wilmette, the high\nschool there was one of the outstanding high
        schools in the country. Not in Wilmette but the one\nwe went to because it
        was a community high school. I had great teachers there. That\u2019s where
        I\nmet the man who encouraged my parents to let me go to art school. He said,
        \u201cCome on, stop\ndiscouraging him. He\u2019ll probably starve but he\u2019ll
        do something with art.\u201d He knew my parents\nwell and persuaded them to
        back me at least for that first year.\n00:45:30\nAW: Your dad was a traveling
        salesman, what did he sell?\nWM: He worked for Crane Company, plumbing fixtures
        and heating.\nAW: And you mother, what did she do?\nWM: She was a mother.
        (Laughs)\nAW: Did you have siblings?\nWM: Yeah, there were five kids in the
        family; three of them have died by this time.\nAW: Were they brothers or sisters?\nWM:
        There were three boys and two girls. The girls were twin sisters.\nAW: Did
        any of them go into art?\nWM: No. My older brother, he became an electrical
        engineer. My younger brother didn\u2019t do\nanything until he got to the
        army and he became a helicopter repairman. My two sisters\u2014one of\nthem
        went into\u2014there was a store in St. Paul called Field-Schlick and she
        came up to visit us\nonce from where she was living with our parents. She
        liked it up here so well that she\napproached Field-Schlick and she got a
        job there. I can\u2019t remember what she did there but it was\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n10\nkind of an administrative
        job in the business. The other one, she got married and had kids. Never\ndid
        hold a job.\nAW: What did your family think when you graduated from Chicago
        [Art Institute] and started a\nstudio and moved to St. Paul? Did they think
        you\u2019d make a go of it?\nWM: No. In fact, when they heard that we had
        been accepted by Leach, it didn\u2019t ring a bell at all.\nThey were not
        involved in art at all. My dad, when he was working for Crane Company, he
        did\ntake me to a big factory they have in Trenton, New Jersey\u2014that was
        when we lived near\nPhiladelphia. And that was fascinating because he got
        in to see everything. He was at the time in\ncharge of analyzing problems
        in the ceramic section, like if a toilet bowl was returned because it\nhad
        a flaw in it. He had to figure out how the flaw occurred. He took us down
        and showed my\nbrother and I everything about the factory: where they were
        making bathtubs and toilets and\nwashbasins and everything. No real connection
        with art\u2014well there was, I guess. They had\ndesigners for their bathtubs
        and everything. That didn\u2019t interest us at the time.\nAW: Just a few
        more questions about these early years when you were just getting started.
        So\nyou met Alix in the ceramics class [at Art Institute of Chicago]. Were
        there many female\nstudents in ceramics class at that time?\n00:50:05\nWM:
        Oh yeah. It was mostly females.\nAW: Why do you think that was?\nWM: I think
        the men were all egocentric and all thought they were going to make a great
        painter.\n(Laughs). It was interesting. One of the best people working in
        the class\u2014in terms of having a\npersonal expression\u2014was a Catholic
        nun who came in her habit\u2014put a coat over it\u2014but she\nmade marvelous
        little sculptural things in clay and was well known for that. The rest of
        them\nwere in it because perhaps they weren\u2019t interested enough to be
        in painting.\nAW: How has that changed over the years?\nWM: I don\u2019t know.
        Everywhere I taught from the St. Paul Gallery and School of Art through the\nUniversity
        and everywhere else where I\u2019ve gone as a temporary instructor or to give
        a workshop\nor something like that, it is almost equally balanced with men
        and women. I don\u2019t know why that\nis. I do know\u2014I hate to say this\u2014but
        the men are the ones that push for the reputation. Maybe\nthey do bigger pots
        or something like that, but there are more well known men ceramicists\nworking
        today, I think, than women. I\u2019m not absolutely positive of that. There
        have been some\nfamous women too.\nAW: I was curious to know more about that
        time and what it was like in those classes, if Alix\nwas unique in her interest
        in ceramics. That was interesting that there were more women than\nmen at
        that time.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n11\nWM:
        Alix also was able to transfer her style of painting to ceramic decoration
        much easier than I\nwas. I was pushing my painting classes and I got into\u2014not
        abstract expressionism but abstract\npainting, very abstract. It became really
        hard-edged geometry. I always used to say, \u201cI\u2019m a poor\nman\u2019s
        Mondrian,\u201d (laughs) whereas as Alix was much more influenced in softer
        forms and more\nirregular forms with the result that she could look at a pot
        and she could just pick it up and start\ndrawing on it with a brush and improve
        the pot because she understood form and the form\nrelationship of the pot
        to the surface decoration. When she died I was really in trouble because\nI\u2019m
        a terrible decorator. I\u2019ve had to concentrate much more on the form of
        the pots I make than I\ndo on the decoration of them.\nAW: When you first
        started doing ceramics what was the style you were doing?\n00:55:00\nWM: We
        had no style. (Laughs). We were just doing utilitarian\u2014we were influenced
        by Leach\u2019s\nstatement, \u201cPottery is a utilitarian art, and this is
        where people can enjoy it everyday.\u201d We were\nmaking functional work
        even before we were at the Leach pottery. Once we got there that was\nessentially
        all that we did: cups, saucers, plates, vases, mugs, all sorts of things.
        I\u2019ll tell you, and\nthis is interesting, Bernard said we could come and
        work with him. We were the first two\nAmericans who had apprenticed at the
        Leach pottery. He had had apprentices from all over the\nworld but no Americans
        before us. They didn\u2019t know what to expect but then they\u2014you realize,\nwe\u2019d
        been teaching in St. Paul before we got there. We\u2019d been trying to run
        our own little studio\nand all, so they thought, Here are people, they\u2019ve
        gone through a professional arts school, taken\nceramics\u2014they didn\u2019t
        know bad the class was, of course\u2014they\u2019ve made their own pots for
        three\nyears, and they\u2019ve taught a couple of years before they came to
        the Leach pottery. They must\nknow how to make pots. They picked some simple
        forms for us to make. The forms that were\nmade in the Leach pottery were
        of two kinds: one was what they called the standardware which\nwas wear which
        was illustrated in a catalogue which was duplicated item for item, sometimes\nvarying
        in glazes and so on but it was something that was sold as inexpensively as
        possible. That\nwas called Standard Wear and that was what we made. Bernard
        and some of the other potters,\nbut not many, made individual pots. Bernard\u2019s
        work was all individual at this time because he\nhad plenty of potters to
        make the standardware.\nWe were assigned pots to make. The first pots I was
        asked to make\u2014oh, I have to describe.\nEvery person who was a thrower
        in the pottery had a making list, which was made up for each\nfiring. It depended
        upon what they had orders for, what pots they\u2019d run out of and the ability
        of\nthat person of what they could make. We were the newcomers and they were
        very kind to us.\nThey fired their big kiln every three weeks and their big
        kiln held two thousand pots. We were\nassigned\u2014each of us, Alix and I\u2014three
        groups of fifty pots each. I remember the ones I started\nwith. I was assigned
        a half-pint beer mug, a small soup bowl and a small pitcher with a handle
        on\nit. I said, \u201cOk,\u201d I looked at the forms they had there and said,
        \u201cI\u2019ll do the mugs first.\u201d They had a\ndrawing of the mug with
        the shape it should be with dimensions on it: height and width and so\non.
        They had a bisque-fired example of each one of the pieces and they knew the
        weight of clay\nto make it. Ok, start on the mugs. I think I need about twelve
        ounces of clay to make a mug or\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n12\nwhatever it as. Made up the clay and made it into
        balls. I watched what other people were doing\nbecause we were not experienced
        in that way.\nAnyway I sat down at the wheel. We had boards like this\u2014which
        is where we got the idea to use\nboards in our studio to carry things around
        on\u2014and I made about three boards of mugs; maybe\nten mugs on each board.
        And then I called one of the regular throwers over to tell me how good\nthey
        were, or bad. Bill Marshall was the guy who had been assigned to check on
        my work. He\nwent to the board of mugs and he said, \u201cWell, this one is
        too tall,\u201d\u2014he had an eye\u2014\u201cThis one is\ntoo fat. This one
        is too rounded. This one is too swoopy this way. This one is too stiff. This
        one\nhas a problem with the proportion of parts of it.\u201d There was something
        wrong with every one of\nthem. He\u2019d just put his finger through them
        and wad them up and do them again. That was Alix\u2019s\nexperience too. Neither
        one of us had learned to throw and put clay where you want it when you\nwant
        it. We\u2019d been throwing and you make a bowl, well, Hey, that\u2019s a
        bowl. Look! A wonderful\nbowl. (Laughs). And here we were asked to make a
        specific form and we had to learn that. It\ntook each of us about the same
        amount of time\u2014it took us about three months\u2014to really become\na
        contributing potter in the studio. They didn\u2019t scrap all our work but
        in the beginning it was all\nand then they began to accept some of it as ok
        and so on, and it went on like that.\n01:02:30\nAW: Who were some of the other
        potters there at the time or other apprentices?\nWM: There were no other apprentices
        when we there because they could only take two\napprentices. Usually they
        only took one apprentice at a time. The fellows who were working\nthere\u2014and
        when we were working there, they were all guys, not women, although they had
        had\nwomen working in the pottery at other times. These were kids who had
        gone to the local school\nand discussing with the schoolteacher they selected
        a couple of guys to come to the pottery and\ntry to make pots. They made a
        good selection because they were still there when we were there.\nOne of them,
        Bill Marshall, he became the best thrower of large pots. He got a lot of attention
        for\nthat because he was really good. Kenneth Quick, who was the other young
        guy, he was the best\nthrower of small pots. He could just whip off the little
        pots we were making. He never had to\nmeasure them; they always came out the
        right size. He was incredibly skilled on making small\npots.\nAW: I think
        you\u2019ve talked about this before in other sources, but can you describe
        Leach\u2019s style\nor form of pottery? What were some of his influences?\nWM:
        They had a simplicity but a complexity, if that makes sense. They were a simple
        bowl, but\nthere was an exact way that that bowl was to be made. I would have
        to draw you pictures to talk\nabout them. There was a bowl we made that was
        called a porringer; you eat your porridge out\nof\u2014it\u2019s a cereal
        bowl. When we made it that bowl had to have a form like this it was cut in\nsharply
        at the bottom. (Draws a form in the air) Also the top edge was tapered so
        it was rather\nthin and came to a bit of a point, which I think was a wrong
        thing. I don\u2019t like that sort of an\nedge on a bowl because it chips
        too easily. It had that and it expanded to a certain size and it had\nto be
        just that way. We gradually learned to make that, but the funny thing about
        it\u2014I don\u2019t\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n13\nthink
        people ordinarily look at shape. The reason I say this is, the Leach pottery
        had this catalog\nthat they published. There were a couple of pages in it
        with a photograph with each of the\ndifferent standardwares that they made.
        We\u2019d looked at that but we probably never paid much\nattention to it
        because one time\u2014this was in our second year that we were there\u2014they
        decided\nthey were going to whitewash the inside of the pottery. It was a
        stone building and the color was\nmessy and all. We had to take everything
        in the building, take it off the shelves and all so we\ncould whitewash the
        walls.\nIn the glazing room there was a high shelf that ran around eight feet
        up\u2014storage stuff. In that\nglazing room we found all kinds of old pots,
        which had been used to store glaze experiments in.\nThere was something wrong
        with the pots. They were made at the Leach pottery, but there was\nsomething
        wrong with them because they couldn\u2019t be sold\u2014maybe they had a crack
        in them\nfrom when they were fired\u2014but they were fine for mixing up glazes
        in. We found this porringer,\nthe same one we were making, but it was nothing
        like the pot we were making. Because over the\nyears everyone\u2019s considered
        idea of how that porringer should be shaped had gradually been\nchanged by
        critical discussions. This old porringer we found\u2014it wasn\u2019t like
        this at all, it was like\nthis. (Laughs) It had a soft shape. It had what
        I would say no articulation. There were no changes\nof direction to give you
        contrasting forms; it was just a bowl. But over the years the studio had\nchanged
        it because they said, \u201cThis can be improved, or we\u2019ll do this or
        we\u2019ll do this.\u201d Still, at\nthe time we were there\u2014this is what
        was made, not this. (Gestures with hand) (Laughs). I guess\nyou\u2019d say
        the pottery was very strictly controlled but those strict controls were subject
        to\nvariation over five, ten years. The pottery had been going since the 1920s
        when we were there so\nit was quite an old pottery. I can\u2019t really tell
        you what kind of pots Bernard\u2014Bernard did favor a\npot with articulation:
        that is, a line that moves and then changes the direction, either abruptly
        or\nsubtlety or whatever, to give the eye something to play with when you\u2019re
        looking at the pot\u2014not\nthat it made the pot work any better\u2014it
        was just nicer to have around.\n01:10:00\nAW: What was it like being there
        at a big production studio? Did you gain any lessons or ideas\nfor how to
        run your own studio?\nWM: Yes we did. When we came back and started our own
        pottery here we patterned our kiln\nafter the one at the Leach pottery. You\u2019ve
        got to think ahead, though, before you do things like\nthat. The kiln at the
        Leach pottery was three-chambers with round arches on it like that. When\nthey
        were packed I was assigned to help Kenneth Quick\u2014this guy who was the
        best thrower of\nsmall pots\u2014he was in charge of packing the kiln and
        I was assigned to help him. Kenneth would\nsit inside and I\u2019d pass him
        things or\u2014because you have to go into the kiln to pack it\u2014or I\u2019d
        be\nsitting inside and Kenneth would be passing me pots to pack in the kiln.
        When we built our own\nkiln we made it a two-chamber kiln but each chamber
        fed into the next one. The only thing\n(laughs) that I didn\u2019t realize\u2014if
        I\u2019m the only one packing the kiln\u2014and I did have to do most of\nthe
        packing because Alix was involved with the kids\u2014I had to keep going in
        and out of that kiln\nand I made the mistake of making it\u2014the top of
        the arch hit me right about there. I could not\nstand up in the kiln. But
        I realized afterwards that we never stood up in the chamber when we\nwere
        packing the one at the Leach kiln; we sat down on a stool and pots were passed
        to us.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n14\nEventually
        I decided to tear that down and build a kiln which is\u2014you know what a
        car kiln is?\nThe whole bottom of the kiln pulls out on wheels and it\u2019s
        packed out in the open and then you\npush it in and it\u2019s done. That\u2019s
        what I have now.\nAW: No more hitting your head on the kiln. (Laughs)\nWM:
        (Laughs) It wasn\u2019t so much hitting my head as my back at the end of the
        day was broken;\nyou couldn\u2019t stand up.\nAW: You left Leach in 1953?\nWM:
        We left in 1952. We started this place in 1953.\nAW: What were you planning
        to make?\nWM: We were going to make the same kind of things but not the same
        forms. We\u2019d say, we\nneed a soup bowl and we\u2019d design a soup bowl.
        Same thing for\nAW: How you would describe your style at that point?\nWM:
        At that point it was very much influenced by what we did at the Leach pottery.
        It took me\nat least two years to get out of the sense that the right form
        was the Leach form. It took Alix less\ntime than that because her painting
        influenced her more. I couldn\u2019t design pots that were made\nout of a
        bunch of straight lines. Her painting allowed her to think of form, which
        went with the\nclay.\n01:15:00\nAW: When you moved back here how did you get
        everything set up? How did you choose where\nto live? You saw an ad for this
        place?\nWM: We bought it. Actually we had to get a bank loan.\nAW: Why did
        you choose to come back to St. Paul?\nWM: We discussed this quite a long time.
        We could have gone anywhere when we came back.\nWe had no connection to St.
        Paul that brought us back here. But Alix was born in Chicago and\nlived all
        of her life there until we got married and then we came up here. I was born
        in Kansas\nCity. We had been talking with Leach about forms and all so much,
        and we felt that our sense of\nwhat we wanted to do went best in the Midwest.
        To this day, I have a much easier time selling\npots in the Midwest than I
        do on the East Coast or the West Coast. Actually, we sold everything\nhere
        right here on the grounds at first. Eventually we had to change that because
        we\u2014I didn\u2019t\ntalk about that we had a big fire and burned down the
        barn. This was long after Alix had died.\nOne of my kids\u2014I had just come
        down to the barn to check on the kiln or the firing and\neverything was going
        great and I adjusted it and I approached the house and one of my daughters\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n15\nwas looking
        out the window and she said, \u201cDad, the barn\u2019s on fire.\u201d There
        was no chance\u2014I\ncouldn\u2019t stop it. It was old dry wood and the kiln
        was in the lower section of the barn. I did learn\nthat if you\u2019re going
        to have a kiln in a building like that, then make that building flameproof.
        The\nkiln room, which is beyond that wall, is completely concrete. The roof
        and floor, everything is\nconcrete. Theoretically it can\u2019t burn. (Laughs)\nAW:
        Let\u2019s hope not. (Laughs) So you were looking around and thought the Midwest
        was the\nbest place. Why was that?\nWM: I don\u2019t know. We felt most at
        home here because we\u2019d always lived [in the Midwest]\u2014I\u2019d\nlived
        in Pennsylvania but that was a short time. If we\u2019d gone elsewhere I\u2019m
        sure I would be\nmaking different kinds of pots.\nAW: Can you explain that
        more? What was it about here that influenced your pottery?\n01:19:30\nWM:
        In other parts of the country the pots that I see that are selling most easily
        are pots that are\nmade very exactly. At the Leach pottery, one thing I did
        learn was to relax a bit about form; it is\nnot an exact form. That\u2019s
        where my first teacher was really off the wall because she thought the\ncloser
        the pots we were hand building were to industrial production\u2014smooth,
        shiny, no\nindentations, no bumps or anything\u2014the better they were. It\u2019s
        the bumps and indentations which\nreally make a pot come alive.\nAW: When
        you were getting your studio set up where did you get your clay from and your\nmaterials
        from?\nWM: We tried getting local clay but we couldn\u2019t find any local
        clay around here that was\nworking at the time. Although our land was very
        sandy and we did use a fine silica sand that we\ngot by digging out of the
        land. But then we sent off to various clay companies that sold ball clay\nand
        fire clay and etcetera and asked for samples of their clays and then we\u2019d
        mix them up in\nvarious quantities and finally we got a combination that we
        thought worked for us, and it was\nbased on the one that we had worked with
        at the Leach pottery. Bernard didn\u2019t want a clay that\nwas too slick
        but he wanted a clay that was durable and could be formed to the forms that
        they\nwanted to make.\nAW: You were just saying that at Bernard\u2019s you
        had learned to relax with form but it seems like\nyou were supposed to stick
        with a certain form. Could you tell me more about your comment\nthere?\nWM:
        When Bernard encouraged us to make pots on our own, why, a different pot came
        out. I\u2019ll\nnever forget\u2014since we lived with Bernard we got to know
        him very well. First of all we went\nthere and we called him Mr. Leach and
        eventually we got to call him Bernard. Everyone else just\ncalled him BL,
        so we were more casual. I was working in the studio one night and it was when\nwe
        were encouraging the other kids in the studio to make pots of their own because
        we were\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n16\ngoing
        to have a big firing and a sale. I was working there and I was struggling
        to make a plate\nthat had some sense of character but that I could make and
        wanted to make. Bernard came into\nthe studio and I was working here and he
        came in the door there and just stood looking at me and\nmy struggles to make
        a plate and then he turned around and there was a big black board on a\ndoor
        of the entry\u2014and he turned around took out his chalk and he drew a beautiful
        plate on\nthere. I shouted at him. I said, \u201cDamnit all Bernard, let me
        make my mistakes. I don\u2019t want to\nmake your pot. I want to make my pot.\u201d
        But he accepted that.\n01:24:10\nI\u2019m still affected by Bernard but probably
        more so by his friend Hamada who is a Japanese\npotter. Well, let me tell
        you, we\u2019d have breakfast in the house, which is right next to the\nworkshop.
        Bernard would finish his breakfast and inevitably he\u2019d reach into his
        pocket and pull\nout a scrap of paper and he had a little pencil about that
        long which he could barely hold and\nhe\u2019d sit down and he would start
        to draw pots that he wanted to make. And he drew beautifully,\njust an expressive
        line that ranged from the softest little bit to a black\u2014just with a pencil.
        And if\nhe didn\u2019t like the drawing he\u2019d X it out and do another
        one. After breakfast he\u2019d have a whole\nbunch of paper and he would throw
        away the ones he didn\u2019t like and the rest of them he\u2019d put in\nhis
        pocket and go off to the studio. He would make those pots that he had drawn.
        His friend\nShoji Hamada never drew a pot before he made it. Bernard admitted
        to us that Hamada, when he\nwas throwing\u2014when they were both working
        together\u2014Hamada, the closest he would come to a\nplan was he would put
        slip on his wheel head\u2014make it messy\u2014and then he\u2019d draw with
        his\nfinger on it. But it was just an idea. Then he would solve the problems
        by making the pot.\nBernard solved the problems in his drawing, and therefore
        his pots were much tighter because he\nwas tracing the pots in his mind.\nWhen
        we had them here for this workshop\u2014we haven\u2019t talked about that,
        but there was a big\ninternational conference in England that Bernard organized
        for potters and another at the same\ntime for weavers. Bernard was in charge
        of the potters, and he asked potters from all over the\nworld and picked ones
        whose work he liked. He asked Hamada to come to the conference.\nHamada came
        and also his friend Yanagi Soetsu who was a leader of the folk craft movement
        in\nJapan\u2014a good friend of Hamada\u2019s also. They came together and
        they came by boat from Japan,\nso it took them quite a while to come. They
        decided that when they went home they would not\ngo back by the Suez Canal
        and India but they were going to keep going west and they were\ngoing to cross
        the United States where Hamada had not been. Yanagi had been here; he had\ntaught
        at Harvard at one time. He was not a craftsperson, he was a philosopher, really.
        They were\ngoing to go home by way of United States. Bernard was also planning
        to go back to Japan with\nthem. We were at this conference\u2014we got invited
        because we were at the Leach pottery\u2014but\nanyway, Alix was standing with
        Hamada and Bernard when they were discussing this and they\nsaid they were
        going to go west across the United States and visit potteries around. Alix
        said,\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re going to go across the United States would
        you be willing to do some workshops\nat different locations?\u201d Hamada
        thought for a while and he said, \u201cWell, if you\u2019ll arrange them,\nwe\u2019ll
        do them.\u201d So she arranged four workshops for them, which was not the
        only places they\nwent. The first one was at Black Mountain College in North
        Carolina and known as an\nexperimental college and all, and they had a pottery
        class there. The second one, because we\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n17\nwere here, was in St. Paul. The third one was at
        the Archie Bray Foundation in Montana. And the\nfourth one was on the West
        Coast in California.\nWe came back and we\u2019d heard that they had arrived
        and they\u2019d gone through North Carolina. It\nwas a two-week workshop that
        they did. They spent a lot of time on these. In between they\nzigzagged all
        over; they visited many more places than these four, but they spent two weeks
        in\neach of these places. We were in charge of arranging the one here in St.
        Paul. We had gone back\nand were still working in St. Paul in that awful little
        art center. I went to North Carolina to\nobserve the one they did there. There
        Bernard and Hamada threw pots all day long and they\ntalked and Hamada gave
        lectures on the folk craft movement. That was it. We decided that we\nwanted
        to make some points with them, which were not just having them make pots.
        One of the\nthings which had been bugging us since we\u2019d left the Leach
        pottery was, how do other people do\nthe same pot again and again and again
        and keep it fresh? We discussed this with Bernard and\nHamada when they came
        to St. Paul and they said they\u2019d be happy to do anything we wanted.\nAlong
        the way we set up a project that was really addressing this duplication problem.
        We said,\n\u201cOk, one of you will design a pot and sit down and make twelve
        of them. Then explain that pot\nto the other one and that person will sit
        down and make twelve of them.\u201d So it turned out that\nHamada drew the
        short straw and he got to design the pot. It was a nice little slip bowl that
        came\nup and had an edge on it and a turned foot. He made it and cut it off
        the wheel and put it down on\nthe board. He sat there and stared at it for
        a minute; then he took another lump of clay and put it\non the wheel and made
        another one. Then he cut it off and put it on the board and then he began\nto
        laugh. I said, \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d He said, \u201cThe second
        pot is always the worst pot.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cThe first pot you\u2019re
        creating something. The second pot you\u2019re copying that; you\u2019re\ntracing
        it and you haven\u2019t learned the form yet. If you do a hundred you should
        probably be able\nto make one that\u2019s better than the first one because
        you get into the rhythm of doing it. But the\nsecond is always the worst.\u201d
        We had settled in our mind anyway that he felt the same we did.\n01:34:30\nAW:
        What happened when Bernard made the same thing?\nWM: Well that was the funny
        thing. Hamada\u2019s was a low bowl like this. When Bernard made his\nit became
        a much deeper bowl. He still had the turned out edge at the top and all but
        a much\ntaller foot on it when it was turned. The answer was that Bernard
        had a rhythm of working with\nform, which he couldn\u2019t break. He was seventy
        some odd years at that time and he just could not\nbreak it. Hamada had a
        rhythm too, but he wasn\u2019t in the position of having to imitate Bernard\u2019s\npot.\nAW:
        Who came to the workshops here in St. Paul?\nWM: We had about two hundred
        people who attended the workshop. It was jammed. They came\nfrom all over
        the country. In fact a bunch of people came from Montana where they were going\nnext.
        They wanted to see how it worked out.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n18\nAW: What were Bernard\u2019s and Hamada\u2019s
        perception of the area?\nWM: We introduced them to as many people as we knew
        who would enjoy their philosophy and\nall. Bernard had been here once before
        when he was on a lecture tour in the United States.\nBecause we were teaching
        at the St. Paul Gallery, we got him to come and give this public\nlecture
        and it was done in conjunction with the Walker Art Center. When he came for
        the lecture\nwe were living in a little apartment and we didn\u2019t have
        room to put him up. The St. Paul Gallery\nwas on Summit Avenue\u2014the fanciest
        place in town\u2014and wealthy people who lived near\nSummit came and took
        classes at the pottery. We got to know some of them very well. One\nfamily
        that we did get to know was the Archer Daniels Midland family. Fannie Daniels
        took\npottery with Alix and she was just hysterical and wonderful and so we
        asked her if they could put\nBernard up. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d They had
        a monstrous house and servants and all and they put him up.\nWhen Bernard
        and Hamada and Yanagi came, we couldn\u2019t put all three of them on the
        Daniels\nso we asked another person who we knew--also connected to the arts
        center just because she was\na patron of it\u2014if she could put up Hamada
        and Yanagi. She said, \u201cOh, of course, would love to.\u201d\nIt turned
        out they went there and this was 1952 so it was shortly after the Second World
        War and\nin the Fitzgerald\u2019s\u2019 house, where Hamada and Yanagi was
        put up, their cook would not cook for\nthem. Mrs. Fitzgerald, she just went
        into the kitchen and cooked. She was wonderful.\nAW: That was not a great
        welcoming for them.\nWM: I don\u2019t think that they knew that this woman
        had refused to cook for them but we found out\nbecause we were told later.
        So there were problems.\nAW: Were there people from the Twin Cities who attended
        the workshop or were they from all\nover Minnesota?\nWM: Yeah, a number of
        people, but I think half of the workshop were from outside the Twin\nCities.\nAW:
        What was the impact of their visit, of their workshop, on the local potters
        community?\n01:40:00\nWM: I think there were a group of people who accepted
        what they said but felt like they had to\ndo it themselves. And another group
        who rejected everything they said. I think there were both\nkinds of things.\nAW:
        Can you say more about the local potters communities? Who was here in the
        Fifties and\nSixties? What were their approaches?\nWM: Many of the people
        out of our classes attended and they were the most accepting. They got\nthe
        most out of the workshop. A lot of people who came they came because they
        gave us money\nto bring them here and the Art Center didn\u2019t have any
        money. We solicited from wealthy people\nand we just gave them an entry to
        the workshop free, of course.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n19\nAW:
        When you moved back and settled here, were there other potters here at the
        time?\nWM: There were a few. There was Martha Cutkomp who was the only potter
        here when we\nmoved here first. She was still around. From the classes that
        had been taught we were getting\npeople who were trying to set up potteries
        in various ways. This was sometime after we had first\ncome up here. The schools
        around had developed programs and it was much better.\nAW: When did you start
        teaching at the University?\nWM: We came back in 1952 and I think I started
        there in 1953.\nAW: When did you retire?\nWM: Nineteen eighty-nine. I had
        married Nancy and we lived out here and so I was feeling, I\nguess, taught
        out. I had been chairman of the department for a couple of years and I wanted
        to\nget out of that. I said I was going to take a leave without pay\u2014if
        you take a leave with pay, you\nhave to come back to make that up after your
        leave is over. So I said to Nancy, who was working\nat the University in the
        dean\u2019s office, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a leave without pay; then
        if I find that it\nworks out, then I don\u2019t have to go back.\u201d I was
        going to ask for a half-year or a year off. She\nworked in the dean\u2019s
        office and she said, \u201cAsk for two years off. You\u2019ll get it.\u201d
        So I did and they\ngave me two years off and I didn\u2019t have to go back.
        I didn\u2019t go back.\nAW: Tell me about your time teaching at the University
        of Minnesota? What stands out to you?\nWhen you started\u2014they were changing
        the department around? What was that like?\nWM: We were trying to build a
        ceramics department because that had been destroyed. The art\ndepartment also
        had a weaving department\u2014that was taught by a woman who was an incredible\nweaver
        and she built that up from nothing. I don\u2019t know what happened but the
        guy who was in\ncharge of the whole art department, and he was the one who
        hired me\u2014he was an art historian\u2014\nand he decided that the weaving
        belonged under home economics rather than art. He stressed art\nhistory and
        painting and sculpture primarily but kept ceramics. We gradually built the
        ceramics\ndepartment and we were able to get an instructor after a few years.
        We wanted someone different\nthan me. We got a guy named Curt Hoard who came
        from Wisconsin, and he was more\ninterested in sculptural things than he was
        in pots. We taught there together for a while. And\nabout that time I retired.\nAW:
        Who was the guy running the art department?\nWM: The fellow who was given
        the authority to change it? Harvey Arneson. He was an art\nhistorian himself
        but he was also an administrator; that\u2019s why he had been selected to
        build up\nthe art department.\nAW: When you started teaching, what was your
        philosophy of teaching?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n20\n01:47:00\nWM:
        I hate to say this, but I really insisted that everyone make utilitarian pots.
        A few years later\nwhen Hoard was hired I realized that I had been too dogmatic
        because he was a different\napproach, much more sculptural, and so I began
        to do this and that and loosen up.\nAW: Did any of your students become instructors
        as well?\nWM: They did become instructors at other schools but not at the
        University. The University\nseldom hires their own students as instructors.\nAW:
        Was Mark Pharis one of your students?\nWM: Yeah, he was one of my students.
        When I quit I sat in on the discussion\u2014they did have a\nsearch for the
        replacement. Mark was the best of anyone who came. Everybody in the art faculty\nsat
        in on this interviewing that applied, and the painters were a real snotty
        group and they were\nasking questions they thought would puzzle these poor
        potters. But Mark Pharis, when he was\nasked questions, most of the questions
        the painters would ask\u2014the potters, we didn\u2019t ask any\nquestions
        because we knew most of these people and what their abilities were\u2014but
        the painters\nwere always digging a bit. Mark Pharis was the only one who
        came and applied and sat in his\ninterview and they\u2019d ask him a question
        and he\u2019d think about it for a long time and then he\u2019d\nrestate the
        question in a much broader way. They were asking for some little fact thing
        and he\u2019d\ntalk about it in a more philosophical way. He won them over.\nAW:
        Sounds like he had a gift for being a teacher for bringing a specific thing
        into a broader\ncontext.\n01:50:10\nWM: Mark turned out to be\u2014it\u2019s
        funny because when he was a student he was kind of a wiseass,\nwise-cracking
        comments that really had no place in the classroom. When he was hired he\nchanged
        completely. Shortly after he was hired he was elected chair of the department.
        There\nwas a lot of infighting and he was the only person who nobody hated.\nAW:
        Over your time at the University of Minnesota what was your role in bringing
        ceramics to\nbe an important part of the art department?\nWM: The ceramics
        department just grew. People liked it and all. They began to also exhibit\noutside
        and so it got a reputation and that attracted more people to the university.\nAW:
        I read somewhere that you were awarded a Regents Professor. Is that right?\nWM:
        Yeah, but that has nothing to do with teaching art. It\u2019s an honor, I
        know.\nAW: Is there anything you miss about teaching at the University?\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n21\nWM: I miss
        the interaction with the people. Now that we\u2019ve got the studio here and
        all, anytime\na group of students or faculty member wants to bring a group
        of students I say, \u201cSure.\u201d It takes\ntime to break your own work
        and talk with them and demonstrate and all of that, but it\u2019s\nworthwhile.\nAW:
        What role do you think you\u2019ve played in shaping the potters community
        in Minnesota?\nWM: It just grew. Ceramics is a wonderful thing and if you
        have a situation where people can\ntake the course and have freedom and explore
        ideas, it will grow. It just worked that way.\nAW: Why do you think people
        were able to do that on their own? What is it about Minnesota\nthat has supported
        ceramics?\nWM: I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t think our students were any
        better than others. They were better than the\nbad schools\u2014there are
        bad schools still. They enjoyed pots. Their friends enjoyed pots. We used\nto
        have class critiques in my classes\u2014I don\u2019t know what Curt did and
        the other instructors\u2014\nwe\u2019d have a class critique and the people
        would be working\u2014maybe they\u2019d be working on a\nproblem, maybe just
        working on an assigned problem, maybe they\u2019re working on their own.\nPeriodically
        we\u2019d have a day off and we wouldn\u2019t work. We\u2019d just bring the
        work in and every\nperson would have a chance to react to it. They really
        were very frank in discussing their work\nback and forth. Some of them they
        liked it so much\u2014that interchange\u2014that when they\ngraduated they
        insisted on starting up a group, which would do the same thing. It could be\nstudents
        or people they knew. By that time there were a lot of potters around. They
        called it Pot\non Spot. (Laughs). Eventually it kind of disintegrated because
        it was a potluck meal that went\nwith the meeting and discussions and it became
        a cooking contest instead of pottery discussion.\n(Laughs).\nAW: Did you ever
        go to these events?\nWM: Sure, always. (Laughs)\nAW: What would you make to
        bring? (Laughs)\nWM: I don\u2019t remember. (Laughs)\nAW: Another follow-up
        question. You mentioned Nancy. When did you meet Nancy?\n01:56:30\nWM: I met
        her when she was hired by the University. The Art Department in the University\u2014a\ndisjointed
        department and we never got things done on time. If forms had to be filled
        out they\nwere always late going in. It was just a sloppy department. Finally
        the Dean of Liberal Arts said,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hire an executive
        secretary. It\u2019s up to you to pick it but you\u2019re going to have\nsomeone
        that makes sure that the department runs right.\u201d Nancy applied and she
        was the best\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n22\napplicant
        that came. I was on the committee that hired her. She came to the department
        and did\norganize it and get it functioning in a reasonable way. She didn\u2019t
        take over the work of the\nchairman, but she did see that things were done
        and done correctly. She got us going so well that\nthe dean hired her away
        from us. (Laughs). He had a bigger budget than we did; we couldn\u2019t pay\nher
        very much. She went to the dean\u2019s office. I was getting very interested
        in her at that time but\nit\u2019s very nice that she went to the dean\u2019s
        office because if she had been working under me as the\nchair I wouldn\u2019t
        have dared say a word to her.\nAW: Nancy\u2014did she have an art that she
        did?\nWM: Yeah, she\u2019s a fiber artist. She just had a big show at the
        White Bear Center for the Arts.\nShe sells her stuff. She gets a lot more
        money for her stuff than I do for mine but it takes her a lot\nlonger to make
        it too, so that\u2019s understandable.\nAW: How does it been for the two of
        you working together? Has she helped in the studio?\nWM: She has tried decorating
        some art on pots. She doesn\u2019t understand the three-dimensional\nform;
        she\u2019s used to working on a flat surface. We\u2019ve tried it but it doesn\u2019t
        work out.\nAW: How about with shows?\nWM: We\u2019ve had a number of shows
        together.\nAW: How have those gone?\nWM: Those have gone well, wonderful,
        wonderful. Her stuff, generally speaking, was two-dimensional\nand went on
        the walls and my stuff went on the flat surfaces.\n02:00:00\nAW: Have those
        shows been here or all around the country?\nWM: All around the country. And
        in Japan, England, many, many places.\nAW: Can we talk about your experiences
        traveling? What have those meant to you to go out and\ndo workshops and demonstrations
        all over the world? Are there places or people who stick in\nyour mind?\nWM:
        You learn something everywhere you go, that\u2019s for sure, is about all
        I can say. I kind of\nenjoy it as long as it doesn\u2019t get too much time
        away from the studio.\nAW: Have there been any surprising moments or responses
        to your work?\nWM: No.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n23\nAW:
        To get to questions related to the Tour and the St. Croix River Valley. We\u2019ve
        been talking\nabout your background history, which has been really interesting.
        You moved here to Stillwater.\nWhat were the St. Croix River Valley area boundaries
        at the time?\nWM: When I started to teach at the University I began to know
        people who lived in this area.\nThere was a painting instructor there\u2014Roy
        Turner\u2014and we became good friends. Also I began\nto realize that some
        of my students\u2014Randy Johnson\u2014went down to teach in River Falls,\nWisconsin.
        He\u2019s just grown and grown and grown as a potter, a wonderful potter.
        He\u2019s been a\nguest\u2014each one on the St. Croix Valley tour, each one
        who has a location can invite up to four\nor six guests. Randy has been a
        guest even though he\u2019s not in the St. Croix River Valley. That\u2019s\nwhat
        has kept it alive. Every year some new potters are showing and sometimes they\u2019ll
        repeat for\na couple of years and then they\u2019ll drop off, or whatever\u2014it
        depends on the people\u2019s studios\nthey\u2019re at. I think there were
        something like eleven studios the last time I went. I didn\u2019t like the\nwork
        that I saw at everyone\u2019s studio but somebody comes along and likes it.\nAW:
        You mentioned earlier that early on you would invite people to show their
        work with you\nand that might have been the start--?\nWM: There it was people
        whose work that I liked.\nAW: Who were the people you invited to show with
        you?\nWM: Guillermo was one. Former students like Mark Pharis and Tim Crane
        and Mike Simon.\nMike was the one who introduced me to Ron Meyers, who is
        from South Carolina, I think.\nAW: How would you do the shows here?\nWM: People
        would bring their stuff and we\u2019d mow the grass down and throw the stuff\u2014\n02:05:00\nAW:
        Who were the people who came to your shows?\nWM: Just general public, mostly.
        We did get a mailing list together once and sent out postcards.\nWhen we first
        started out we\u2019d just take blank postcards from the post office and write,
        \u201cPots,\npots, pots,\u201d and send them off to people; give them the
        dates and that\u2019s all we did. Then we got a\nlittle fancier and had something
        printed, but it worked well.\nAW: Why has the Tour developed so successfully?\nWM:
        They get a lot of good publicity out and that\u2019s something that we never
        did when we just\nhad our friends showing our work here. We just were happy
        to sell pots. They do a lot of good\npublicity and they have a wonderful variety
        of people that their work they\u2019re showing, plus the\nguests who come
        in\u2014all of that has made it quite exciting. The idea of this pottery tour
        where\nthe work is sold at people\u2019s studios and the people can see the
        location and all that has been\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n24\npicked up in a number of other places. One fellow
        who was a former student of mine moved up\nto Duluth and he got involved in
        a tour up there and they call it Crossing Borders. They have\nrepresentatives
        all along from Duluth all the way over to Grand Marais. Not just pottery,
        but all\nsorts of arts. They get a big crowd who get in their car and drive
        up there. Wonderful.\nAW: Have you come across any other tours like this in
        other parts of the country?\nWM: There are some in other parts of the country.
        I think the idea has mushroomed. There are a\nlot that I don\u2019t know about.\nAW:
        Do you think the St. Croix River Valley tour has played a role in encouraging
        other people\nto do similar tours?\nWM: I can\u2019t say that. I know there
        are more and more, but maybe it\u2019s something that is\nspreading as a way
        to look at and sell arts and crafts.\nAW: So you never officially participated
        in the Tour?\nWM: No.\nAW: But it seems like the first two or three years
        they have you listed as part of the Tour?\nWM: They may have, but it would
        just be the people who would come here and see what I have.\nThat\u2019s all.\nAW:
        Did you ever participate in any planning?\nWM: No.\nAW: Do you see that the
        Tour has changed the potters\u2019 community in the area?\nWM: Yeah. It\u2019s
        grown and it\u2019s much more interactive. It\u2019s a real thing. It\u2019s
        great.\nAW: Grown more? Interactive? More potters now? Has it encouraged more
        people to pursue\npottery?\nWM: Yeah, more potters. And bringing in guests,
        that helps.\nAW: Has it changed anything for you?\n02:10:00\nWM: (Shakes head
        no). We used to sell all our pots here at the studio or through exhibitions
        we\nhad. I can\u2019t remember when this happened, but it would be after I
        burned down the pottery and\nwe built this and the building next door was
        a showroom. It was an honor showroom: that is,\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n25\nthere was no way there to sell you
        pots; the pots all had prices on them and there was a basket\nwhere you drop
        your money or a check and you wrapped your own pots and took them away.\nUnfortunately
        this happened because there were a group of people\u2014I know who they were.\nThey
        were immigrant people and they didn\u2019t have jobs and somehow they found
        out about this\nshowroom. I had a sign in there, \u201cPlease limit your purchases
        to two pots per person per firing.\nThere will always be another firing so
        you\u2019ll get more chances.\u201d Since it was an unattended\nshowroom they
        found out that they could buy as many as they wanted and a couple of days
        later\nthey were for sale on the internet\u2014they weren\u2019t buying them
        for themselves. We had to close the\nshowroom.\nThat\u2019s forced me now\u2014once
        in a while I sell some pots here, but most of my pots are sold\nthrough the
        Northern Clay Center and other galleries around the country. But that means
        that\nthese galleries have to mark the prices up and some of the galleries
        are almost as bad as the\npeople who were buying too many and selling on the
        internet. They jack the prices way up. I\nplead with them not to, but they
        know what their problems are and they say they have to do this.\nAW: So you
        contacted them?\nWM: Yeah.\nAW: This is another questions we ask about the
        Tour: How has the Internet or other technology\nchanged how you sell your
        work and how the public interacts with your work?\nWM: It\u2019s not the Tour
        that changed how I sell my work\u2014it\u2019s the fact that the showroom
        didn\u2019t\nwork anymore. It\u2019s too bad. Northern Clay Center comes the
        closest to any of the galleries I\nwork with to just using a nice normal markup.
        But even they suffer a bit.\nAW: Has this affected other potters you know?\nWM:
        Some of these galleries say, \u201cI can\u2019t sell your pots with a low
        markup because it will\nundersell the other potters that I\u2019m selling.\u201d
        I think, Your job is to explain to them why I\u2019m\nmaking a type of pot
        that I can make very simply and rapidly and they\u2019re making a different
        kind\nof pot and it has to pay\u2014they\u2019re not getting rich on it, but
        they have to get paid for their time\ntoo. That\u2019s what I think the job
        of a gallery owner is\u2014not to try and level out so everyone is\nselling
        at the same price.\nAW: What is the future for you and your work and selling
        it?\nWM: I\u2019m not going to make pots much longer. I\u2019m ninety years
        old and I\u2019m slowing down. I\nknow my pots are not as good as they used
        to be but I still like to make them, so I\u2019ll go on\nmaking them as long
        as I can, but they won\u2019t be much. That\u2019s just the way it goes.\nAW:
        Speaking back to your issues with some of the galleries\u2014something like
        the Tour or the\nshows that you used to have\u2014that seems like an opportunity
        for artists to sell directly to people\nwho want to buy their work. How important
        are those shows for potters?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n26\n02:15:30\nWM:
        If they\u2019re like the Tour\u2014the potters can set their own prices. The
        person who\u2019s having\ntheir studio used and inviting guests\u2014he doesn\u2019t
        tell the guests how to price their work. They\ncan price it any way they want.
        That works closer to just selling it out of your own place.\nAW: A few more
        questions here on the impact of the Tour. What do you think the impact of
        the\nTour has been for the St. Croix River Valley area?\nWM: I think it\u2019s
        been great. It\u2019s grown every year; more and more people are hearing about
        it\nand more and more people are coming. I know the income of the potters
        has gone up\nconsistently. Guillermo Cuellar\u2014who\u2019s a good friend
        of mine\u2014he said this last year was the\nbiggest year he\u2019s ever had.
        He said that without checking about the other people but I\u2019m sure\nthey
        were all experiencing the same increase in sales.\nAW: Why do you think it\u2019s
        grown so much?\nWM: I don\u2019t know.\nAW: You do know many of the people
        involved in the Tour. Can you say a few words about\nsome of the people you
        know who are involved in the Tour? What was your relationship with\nsome of
        the hosts?\nWM: I didn\u2019t know Bob Briscoe because he didn\u2019t go to
        school near here. He went to school\nsomewhere else and he moved here. I first
        saw his work at a gallery in town and I was really\nexcited by it. Since then
        I\u2019ve gotten to know him and know his work even better. I probably\nknow
        most of them now, although a couple in the middle part of the Tour there that
        I don\u2019t\nknow. I can\u2019t even remember their names. All the rest of
        them are friends.\nAW: Were they students?\nWM: Some of them, not all.\nAW:
        Now Guillermo you met in Venezuela? What was it like when you met\u2014it
        seemed like\nthere was a great connection there? We talked with Guillermo
        as well and he really remembers\nthe first time he met you and was learning
        about your work.\nWM: I was doing a workshop and I was asked down to Caracas
        to give this workshop. I said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t speak Spanish.\u201d And
        they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find you an interpreter.\u201d I went down and
        we had\nthis workshop for two weeks. The interpreter\u2014who was a very nice
        guy\u2014I don\u2019t think he was a\npotter but he was interpreting. I met
        Guillermo because he was taking the workshop\u2014he was not\nhired as an
        interpreter\u2014but I found out quickly that he spoke very good English because
        he\nmarried a woman from America and he\u2019d been here going to school,
        also. He spoke very good\nEnglish. I was saying something and this guy who
        was supposed to interpret\u2014I said something\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n27\npretty simple and this guy started
        to talk and he talked and he talked and he talked. I finally\nturned to Guillermo
        and I said, \u201cGod, I didn\u2019t think it took so much longer to say something
        in\nSpanish as it does in English.\u201d He said, \u201cWell it doesn\u2019t,
        but he\u2019s kind of showing off and he\u2019s\nsaying it in,\u201d\u2014I
        don\u2019t know what the versions are but one is the local vernacular and
        one is the\nCastilian\u2014\u201cBut secondly, he\u2019s not saying what you
        said.\u201d From then on Guillermo became my\ninterpreter. So that\u2019s
        how I got to know him and his pottery. Then they decided they couldn\u2019t\nstand
        Venezuela anymore so they moved up here. He worked with me for quite a while
        because\nhe had no other place to work. Now he\u2019s got a great pottery.
        He\u2019s going a mile a minute. He\u2019s a\ngreat potter.\n02:21:40\nAW:
        What was it like to have him work with you? You said you\u2019d had one apprentice--?\nWM:
        Guillermo wasn\u2019t an apprentice. He was a professional potter and I wasn\u2019t
        responsible for\nhim at all. He\u2019s a great worker and he knows how to
        see things that need to be done or do them.\nAW: Did you have many professional
        potters come work with you or was this unusual?\nWM: No, except for these
        groups that would come for a week or so and we\u2019d fire one kiln.\nAW:
        What about some of the other members of the Tour? Richard Abnet\u2014did you
        know him?\nWM: He was a student of mine but he left the University and he
        went to graduate school\nsomewhere else. I knew Rich.\nAW: He moved into the
        area pretty early on as well. It seemed like the two of you were the only\npotters
        here for a while?\nWM: No, there were other potters around.\nAW: Did you guys
        talk much or was there a strong sense of community then?\nWM: There was, but
        primarily it came about through the commonality of the University\nsituation.\nAW:
        What is the sense of community now in the potters\u2019 community? Is there
        a strong sense of\ncommunity?\nWM: I don\u2019t think there is a center to
        it. I think it\u2019s interesting that now the Minneapolis Art\nInstitute
        has taken a greater interest in craftwork than they used to. The Walker, of
        course, has\nmoved the opposite direction and moved away from crafts. There\u2019s
        just a lot more activity. There\nare galleries that show craftwork in town.
        The Northern Clay Center is just great because they\nteach classes, they have
        studio space that they rent at a very modest amount, and they sell masses\nof
        pots, masses of them. They\u2019ve had a big effect.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n28\nAW: And individual potters like
        yourself? Are you part of building the potters community?\n02:25:00\nWM: I
        sell through Northern Clay Center. That\u2019s as much as I can say I\u2019m
        part of the\ncommunity. I know the potters. We all know one another.\nAW:
        I\u2019m asking this because we\u2019ve talked to all the other members of
        the Tour and they all\nmention you as someone they learned from or they admire
        your work or that you\u2019ve taught them\nsomething about pottery and how
        to do these shows. So, I\u2019m asking you now looking back the\nother way
        what your thoughts are on this community.\nWM: We try to go on the Tour when
        we can, but we haven\u2019t been able to now because of my\nwife\u2019s illness.\nAW:
        To run though the other members of the Tour: Connee Mayeron?\nWM: She was
        a student at the University.\nAW: I was just looking back at her interview
        and she was talking about being in a class of yours.\nShe apparently had a
        much different idea of pottery than you did?\nWM: I don\u2019t expect my students
        to all think like I do. (Laughs). That I\u2019ve learned over the years.\nThey\u2019ve
        all got their own ideas. You\u2019ve heard this, but someone asked Shoji Hamada
        how he\nknew what a good pot was and he said, \u201cThe pots I like are good
        pots\u2014for me.\u201d Not that they\nwere the only good pots, but he was
        the one who was making the decisions. He was telling\neveryone, \u201cYou
        make the decision. If you like the pot it\u2019s a good pot for you.\u201d\nAW:
        That\u2019s a good way to approach it. You see this at the Tour the variety
        of potters means that\nanybody going usually finds something that they like.
        Some other early members of the Tour\nwere Will Swanson and Janel Jacobson?\nWM:
        I don\u2019t know Will. I don\u2019t know where he came from or his training.
        I do know Janel\nbecause she was a student at the University.\nAW: Did you
        get to know Janel? She was in the area too.\nWM: Yeah, sure. She did wonderful
        pots before she got into these netsuke that she does now.\nShe did exquisite
        engraved porcelain\u2014just marvelous.\nAW: Did you ever do shows together
        or have much interaction?\nWM: No. We\u2019d visit her but I guess I\u2019m
        more excited by her netsuke than I am by her porcelain\nbecause her porcelain\u2014because
        of the time she spent on it\u2014had to cost so much that it ran out\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n29\nof my range. Yet
        they were worth it. They were really beautifully made. Have you ever seen
        any\nof those?\nAW: Her pots? Yeah, we saw a few examples. She showed us mostly
        the netsuke that she\u2019s\nworking on.\nWM: She used to take porcelain and
        she\u2019d engrave these pictures of insects and things like that\nand the
        detail was just fantastic. They\u2019re beautifully fired. The only thing
        is that she\u2019d spend so\nmuch time on this little covered pot that she
        had to charge a lot of money for them just to get her\ntime out. I often wondered,
        What in the world do you use a little covered pot like that for? The\nclosest
        thing I know to it is there is a red ink which the Japanese use and they baste
        it into a small\nlidded pot like that, and when they want to stamp their stamp
        on something they just touch it to\nthe ink and just like that, but I don\u2019t
        think she sells them for that. Maybe they just love to look at\nthem and that\u2019s
        reason enough.\n02:30:25\nAW: That\u2019s really interesting too as we\u2019ve
        been seeing people\u2019s pottery is how there are some\nsimilarities\u2014particularly
        people who have studied with you or pursued functional pottery\u2014but\nalso
        to have Janel\u2019s work and Connee\u2019s work too as something different.
        Jeff Oestreich?\nWM: Yeah, Jeff was a student.\nAW: And he went on to practice
        at Leach\u2019s studio?\nWM: That\u2019s right, he did. We used to own a beautiful
        pot of Jeff\u2019s that he did early on. I don\u2019t\nknow what we did with
        it. I think we probably gave it to a museum somewhere because it was so\nnice.
        Then he went to New Zealand\u2014Jeff loves to travel\u2014and he went to
        New Zealand and he\nmet potters there and traveled around. He traveled to
        one town\u2014I can\u2019t remember the name of\nthe town\u2014but this town
        had been destroyed by a fire\u2014completely destroyed\u2014at a critical
        time.\nIt was rebuilt at the time of Art Deco and all the houses and buildings
        have little Art Deco\ndecorations on them and Jeff was so fascinated by that
        that it changed his pottery and he began to\ndecorate in the same manner.
        Just walking into this town and seeing it. We were there and it was\nan exciting
        town, but I wasn\u2019t looking for anything to change my pottery.\nAW: I
        remember him telling us about that too. He was even tracing some of his interest
        in Art\nDeco back to growing up and I think his mother had some jewelry or
        something that had similar\ndesigns.\nAW: Getting back to your work\u2014what
        has inspired you and your pottery?\nWM: I\u2019m most influenced by Korean
        pottery, which Leach introduced me to, and Hamada, also.\nYou know the Japanese
        love Korean pottery too. They love it because of the casual attitude of\nthe
        Korean potters, but they have realized that they can\u2019t adopt this casual
        attitude and so what\nthey have done is to bring Korean potters to Japan and
        establish them in different areas and they\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n30\nbrought the Korean approach to Japan. But they
        didn\u2019t try to copy of them. They brought the\npotters in because that\u2019s
        the way they feel about pottery.\nAW: What is it about Korean pottery that
        you like?\nWM: They\u2019re never showing off, well, in the Korean pottery
        I like. There was one period of time\nwhere they were doing a lot of inlaid
        stuff and I think that\u2019s so much decoration. We have a\nbunch of Korean
        pots in our house and they\u2019re just superb. The pot that I like the most\u2014well
        I\ncan\u2019t say I like the pot the most of all of our pots but it certainly
        affects me the most\u2014is one\nwhich was made by Korean potters but it was
        made in Japan because the Japanese brought these\npotters into this one village.
        It was from that village\u2014you can tell\u2014but it doesn\u2019t look like
        a\nJapanese pot; it looks like a Korean pot.\n02:35:38\nAW: Why do you make
        what you make?\nWM: I just like making pots, that\u2019s all. (Laughs).\nAW:
        You\u2019ve been doing this now for how many years? Almost sixty years? Why
        do you\ncontinue to make what you\u2019re making?\nWM: Because every time
        I sit down at the wheel I can make something that I\u2019ve never made\nbefore.
        I often do but I also repeat myself.\nAW: Do you ever draw your pots before
        making them?\nWM: Little sketches but not exact drawings, not like what Bernard
        did. I\u2019ll do a sketch to set sort\nof proportion and so on.\nThe most
        I\u2019ll do\u2014I took from the Leach pottery, or, Alix and I took from
        the Leach pottery\u2014the\nidea of making a making list. It\u2019s not that
        you need to make those pots\u2014in fact I often deviate\nfrom my making list\u2014but
        it gets me going. I don\u2019t have to come down in the morning and say,\nWhat
        am I gonna to make? What am I gonna to make? I look at the list and I can
        pick any one of\nthose things and I can start right into it. It saves time,
        but I\u2019m not on this list like the Leach\npottery was on the list. They
        were running a completely different sort of situation where they did\ntake
        orders and so they had to fill the orders and we don\u2019t do that.\nAW:
        At various points did you take orders?\nWM: When we started we did, but when
        my wife died I took that opportunity to cancel all the\norders on the books
        and since then I\u2019ve never taken orders. I make the pots and if they see
        them\nand like them, they can buy them. But I\u2019m not going for something
        that they\u2019re imagining in\ntheir head and it\u2019s not the thing that
        I imagine.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n31\nAW:
        You said you had to set a limit for what people could purchase in the showroom.
        Why was\nthat?\nWM: Our pots were always cheap. I keep them as cheap as I
        possibly can. By selling them in the\nshowroom we\u2019re selling them at
        wholesale price, you see, and people would take advantage of\nthat and just
        buy a whole bunch of things. It just didn\u2019t work out because they were
        buying not to\nuse, but to sell. But a gallery does the same thing.\nAW: Why
        do you think your pottery has been so popular?\nWM: It was cheap. Some people
        don\u2019t like my pots at all. It\u2019s not popular that way.\nAW: Why is
        there such a demand for them?\nWM: I don\u2019t know.\nAW: Have you ever heard
        from people who have bought them and they\u2019re using them?\nWM: I hear
        people, they say, \u201cI have my coffee out of a mug of yours and I love
        it.\u201d They might\njust as well love someone else\u2019s mug too. (Laughs)\n02:40:20\nAW:
        I think you\u2019re being very modest. (Laughs)\nWM: Like Hamada said, \u201cThe
        pot you like is the pot for you, a good pot for you.\u201d\nAW: A couple of
        reflection questions. What has pottery meant in your life?\nWM: It\u2019s
        the one thing that I started to do and I still love doing it. I used to be
        a painter and I\nloved to paint when I was painting, but I don\u2019t miss
        painting at all now. The idea of firing\u2014the\nway we learned at the Leach
        pottery, which is we fire under reduction. Do you know what that\nis? When
        you have a fuel-burning kiln, when you short the fuel of air it produces smoky
        flame\nand then that smoke, that hot smoke, is trying to combine with oxygen
        from anywhere it can get\nit, and it takes the oxygen out of the chemicals
        on your pot. The opposite of that is an oxidation\nfire where you have adequate
        air, oxygen, and you keep the chemicals in their oxidized form. My\nglazes
        are designed for reduction firing. Because reduction firing is not a finite
        thing I can get all\nsorts of surprises out of a kiln. You look at it and
        you see it\u2019s reducing and you say, It\u2019s fine, and\nalong comes a
        draft of air and sucks more air up the chimney and therefore sucks it in around
        the\nburner and you get an oxidation and it will change everything.\nThe last
        firing, before the one I\u2019m working on now, I had a bad firing and I don\u2019t
        know to this\nday what caused it. Somehow my kiln was leaking air and instead
        of the pots coming out with\nthe richness they should have, they came out\u2014in
        one section of the kiln\u2014they were all oxidized\nand they were all a little
        bit under fired, and they were all just deadly dull. (Laughs). I\u2019m trying\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n32\nto re-fire
        some of them, whether or not I\u2019m successful? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d
        probably be better off\njust throwing them away and making new pots.\nAW:
        So it is the element of surprise that keeps you interested in doing this?\nWM:
        That\u2019s right. My kiln that I use for the first firing for the pots\u2014for
        bisque firing\u2014is a\ncommercial electric kiln. It has electric elements
        in it and they heat it up, but there\u2019s air coming\nin from any place
        it wants to come and there\u2019s no smoke or anything. It always fires oxidized.
        I\ngot in the habit of taking and making a special group of pots to fill the
        electric kiln and I use two\nglazes on them. One is a copper green and the
        reason I use it in the electric kiln is that if I used it\nin my reduction
        kiln it would turn an ugly liver color. I love the green. The other is an
        amber tan,\ntransparent and kind of shiny. Those two glazes need oxidation
        so I fire them in the electric kiln.\nBut when I open the lid to my electric
        kiln, it\u2019s boring. Every green pot is the same green all the\nway through
        the firing. Every amber pot is the same amber. That\u2019s not right. You
        want to make\npots to be excited by them.\n02:45:50\nAW: When have you been
        most excited about the pots you\u2019ve made?\nWM: I can\u2019t say because
        I\u2019ve had great firings and I\u2019ve had terrible firings but I\u2019ve
        forgotten\nthem.\nAW: When you\u2019re not doing pottery, what are you doing?
        Any hobbies or interests?\nWM: No. I read a lot. (Laughs).\nAW: Are you still
        traveling a lot?\nWM: Not since my wife got sick.\nAW: What has it meant to
        you to be in this place? You\u2019ve been in this place for sixty years. Why\nhere?\nWM:
        I love it. We got it just by chance. It was available and cheap. It\u2019s
        neat. Of course it was\nnothing like this when we bought it. The house was
        a dumb little house that was straight up and\nhad too many windows in it and
        it had all sorts of things were wrong with it. This was a big barn\nfor cows
        down here.\nAW: The original barn burned. Right? This has changed a lot.\nWM:
        Yeah, this has changed completely down here. The house has changed a lot too.
        When I\nmarried Nancy she said, \u201cSome changes got to be made in this
        house.\u201d It didn\u2019t have a very good\nkitchen and a lot of things
        were wrong with it. I was just too lazy to work on it without the input\nthat
        she had.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n33\nAW:
        When did you guys get married and when did she move in?\nWM: Nineteen eighty-nine.
        Not too long ago. No, before \u201989. My wife would tell you exactly.\nAW:
        I asked because after your wife [Alix] passed, were you raising your children
        on your own?\nWM: I was.\nAW: What was that like to balance pottery and being
        a father?\nWM: Very difficult.\nAW: Were there other single fathers that you
        knew of in the arts community?\nWM: No.\nAW: Did your children go on to pursue
        art?\nWM: One of them lives in Minneapolis and one lives in Vermont. The one
        in Vermont is a writer\nand having some success. The one in Minneapolis doesn\u2019t
        know what she wants to do and she\u2019s\nnow over fifty years old, so I don\u2019t
        know if she\u2019ll ever find out what she wants to do.\nAW: What are their
        names?\nWM: Tamsyn, T-a-m-s-y-n, and Shawn, S-h-a-w-n.\n02:50:00\nAW: Tamsyn,
        that\u2019s a really interesting name. Where is that from?\nWM: When we knew
        we were expecting a child we were fascinated with Cornish names from\nliving
        in St. Ives. We wrote to a friend there and we said, \u201cSend us a bunch
        of old Cornish\nnames.\u201d We got a letter a few days later that had all
        these boys\u2019 names and girls\u2019 names and all.\nHe had a little note
        on it that said, \u201cThe only place that I could find old Cornish names
        was in the\ngraveyard.\u201d (Laughs).\nAW: Is Tamsyn, is she the one that
        moved?\nWM: She lives here. Shawn moved to Vermont. She went to school in
        Vermont and she liked it\nso much she decided to stay there.\nAW: Did they
        ever try pottery?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n34\nWM:
        They used to play. Yeah, they did try. In fact I got in trouble with one of
        my classes one\ntime because Tamsyn wanted to learn to throw on a wheel. I
        had to kick the wheel for her and\nshe threw the pot. She made a couple little
        simple cups, but they were ok. I took one of them to\nschool and I showed
        them to my class. I said, \u201cLook, a five-year old girl made this and if
        you\ncan\u2019t do better you\u2019re going to fail the course.\u201d (Laughs).
        That didn\u2019t make people very happy.\n(Laughs).\nAW: Did they attend schools
        in the area?\nWM: Yeah.\nAW: What about the neighbors? Have you had the same
        neighbors?\nWM: When I first moved here there were no neighbors. The nearest
        neighbor was half a mile\naway.\nAW: So when we took a turn on 68th there
        were no neighbors. Now there seemed a half dozen?\nWM: Yeah, and bigger and
        bigger houses. They were all farmers, the few that were here.\nAW: How has
        this area changed over the years?\nWM: Our house has changed because we changed
        it, but the property hasn\u2019t changed much\u2014our\nproperty hasn\u2019t
        changed. Other properties have changed because what used to be a farmer\u2019s\nfields
        or a dairy farm is now a couple of houses. That\u2019s all happened in the
        past six years.\nAW: Is there something unique about the potters\u2019 community
        here compared to other places in\nthe country?\nWM: No, I don\u2019t think
        so. Potters tend to get together.\nAW: Differently than maybe in other arts
        communities?\nWM: Sure, yeah.\nAW: Why do potters tend to get together?\nWM:
        I don\u2019t know, (laughs) because there\u2019s so many things that you don\u2019t
        understand. Every\ntime I see someone else\u2019s work I have to start all
        over and I have to look at it the way they\nlooked at it.\nAW: Do you feel
        that potters share with each other?\nWM: Generally they do. There are a few
        that are secretive, but in America it is much more likely\nthat the potters
        will share. The only one I heard was some guy\u2014he was a potter in California
        and\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n35\nhe
        was striving to make a particular Chinese glaze of a certain color. He got
        it finally and he\nwouldn\u2019t give anyone the formula for it. He would
        sell you a five-gallon bucket of the glaze, but\nhe wanted a fortune for it.
        He was a nut.\n02:55:35\nAW: Is it uncommon for people to not share?\nWM:
        I think it is. All the potters I know, they share anything they are doing
        with anyone else;\nthere\u2019s no secrets. I used to tell my students sometimes
        when some of them, if they were doing\nglaze experiments they get a little
        iffy about it, I\u2019d say, \u201cHave you ever heard a painter say, \u2018I\nhave
        a particular blue and if I gave you the formula for that blue you\u2019ll
        be as good a painter as I\nam?\u2019\u201d\nAW: What are your hopes for the
        future of pottery in Minnesota?\nWM I hope it continues to grow and people
        are more and more interested in having handmade\nwork or having it in their
        home. The ones that are irritating are the ones who buy it and never\ntouch
        it because it\u2019s handmade. That\u2019s silly.\nAW: Why is it so important
        to have that connection with functional pottery? Why do you want\npeople to
        have the pottery in their hands?\nWM: To use it. It\u2019s only by using it
        that you really understand it, you know? I\u2019ll tell you one last\nanecdote.
        When we had Hamada and Leach for this workshop here my wife also said to Hamada,\n\u201cSince
        you\u2019re going to do a workshop could we have a show of your work here?\u201d
        Hamada\nthought for a while\u2014and he was in England at that time\u2014and
        finally he said, \u201cI\u2019ll call my son\nand have him select a small
        show and send it to you.\u201d And so he did. I think his son sent about a\nhundred
        pots along, a wonderful variety of things. There were so many people at this
        workshop\nthat we had to draw straws as to what order people\u2014if they
        wanted to buy\u2014could make a\nselection and then they could buy one pot
        or one unit. They said that was ok. Hamada\u2014when the\npots were on the
        way\u2014he asked me if I would sit down with him and tell him about pricing\nbecause
        he didn\u2019t want to overshoot the American market. In Japan, pots are very
        expensive. But\nhere they\u2019re more expensive than mine but they\u2019re
        not as expensive as in Japan.\nSo he had a bill of lading and a description
        of the pots and he would describe the pot and I\u2019d say,\n\u201cWell, if
        I were making it, it would be ten dollars. But here\u2019s a really important
        potter so the\nleast we can do is multiply that by five, so instead of selling
        it for ten dollars it will sell for fifty.\u201d\nHamada never questioned.
        He just wrote down whatever I said and that was the price that went\non those
        pots. I told the gallery where we were showing this, I said, \u201cBecause
        he has not argued\nabout these prices, you\u2019ve got to not take any money
        for selling it. You can\u2019t mark it up.\u201d They\nagreed to that. There
        were more people who wanted pots than there were pots. The only way to\ndo
        it was to have a lottery. We put the numbers from one to a hundred on pieces
        of paper and put\nthem into a hat; everybody can pull their number. My wife,
        who had gotten the show here, she\nstill didn\u2019t take advantage. She drew
        number two. That was just chance, but she did. I drew\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. MacKenzie\n07\/18\/14\n36\nnumber ninety-four or something
        like that. When number two was called we went in. We didn\u2019t\nhave much
        money but with her number two we picked a set of six small plates. When I
        tell you\nthese were inexpensive these six small plates only cost us thirty-five
        dollars; that\u2019s what we\npicked, they\u2019re lovely. We have them and
        we use them all the time.\nAnyway we were watching other people and we\u2019d
        say, \u201cIf no one picks that one when ninety-four\nis called, we\u2019ll
        pick that one.\u201d But of course it would disappear. Finally they called
        ninety-four\nand we went in. By that time they were calling two numbers at
        a time because it was taking\nso long for people to make up their minds. We
        saw one pot that was tempting but we thought,\nWe\u2019ll pick that and carry
        it around and see if we find something better. We looked and looked\nand we
        didn\u2019t find anything better. Only after we took it to the secretary and
        recorded our\npurchase did Yanagi, the head of the Japanese folk craft movement,
        and a good friend of\nHamada\u2019s who knew his work\u2014he had been watching
        all of this\u2014he came up to us and he said,\n\u201cYou just bought the
        best pot in the whole show.\u201d We thought, He\u2019s being nice. No, I
        don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019s a best pot. There are better pots. But it depends
        on the individual and what you think the\nbest pot is. That pot, which we
        hesitated to buy, it has grown on me since we bought it.\nWhen I used to teach,
        I\u2019d take pots out of our collection to school and show students so we
        could\ntalk about them. Nobody ever reacted to that pot the first time they
        saw it, but many people\u2014\nafter thinking about it awhile\u2014they\u2019d
        say, When are you going to bring that brown Hamada pot\nback? Because they
        wanted to see it again. It grows on you slowly. It grew on us slowly too.
        We\nused to use it in the house when the kids were little. We\u2019d fill
        it with peanuts and raisins and it\nwas kept on the coffee table so kids could
        get food out. (Laughs). I still call it a dumb pot. It\u2019s\nnot a difficult
        pot to make. It\u2019s not an elaborate form. It doesn\u2019t have a beautiful
        glaze on it. It\u2019s\njust a pot, but it affects people. So maybe Yanagi

        Oestreich on June 9, 2014 in Almelund, Minnesota,\nwhich is near Taylors Falls
        and North Branch at Jeff\u2019s house. This interview is for the \u201cA\nMeasure
        of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,\u201d
        made\npossible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Also
        present during this\ninterview is Tierney McNabb, project assistant. Thank
        you for agreeing to be interviewed and\nlet\u2019s get started.\nCould you
        tell us about your name? You were starting to describe the meaning of your
        name.\nJO: In this country it\u2019s an uncommon name; it\u2019s a German
        name. It translates as \u201cAustria.\u201d And\nO-e-s-t is \u201ceast\u201d
        and then r-e-i-c-h is \u201creich\u201d or \u201ckingdom.\u201d And the eastern
        reich, or kingdom,\nof Germany was Austria, so it means \u201cAustria.\u201d
        When I was in Germany I looked up our name in\nthe phonebook\u2014pages, and
        pages, and pages; it\u2019s very common. In this country it\u2019s more\nobscure.
        Although we lived next door to another Oestreich family, we were not related.
        And my\nsister had a car accident on the highway, and the other person\u2014the
        other car\u2014was a Nancy\nOestreich too and they both had the same insurance
        company and they got the claims goofed up.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n2\nAnd there\u2019s three Jeffrey Oestreichs at my
        clinic, where I go for my injections and stuff. So,\nthey\u2019re not related.
        It\u2019s a name that we all cursed as kids, but now I appreciate it. (Laughs)\nAW:
        (Laughs) Well, you were saying that you\u2019ve been thinking about changing
        it. Tell us more\nabout that.\nJO: I\u2019m thinking of changing the pronunciation
        to \u201cO-strike,\u201d because of the difficulty of people\nfinding me on
        the internet. And I did have one uncle that did pronounce it \u201cO-strike,\u201d
        that\u2019s an\nexception. So I\u2019m in transition, pronouncing it both
        ways. I may at some point dump the \u201cA-strike\u201d\nand go with the \u201cO-strike.\u201d
        But it originally had an umlaut over the \u201co\u201d which we can\u2019t\npronounce,
        the \u201co\u201d with an umlaut, it\u2019s more of \u201cuuoh\u201d\u2014(whispers)
        no can\u2019t do that\u2014\nAW: \u201cA-strike\u201d is the correct pronunciation?\nJO:
        How we do it. And do you know why that happened? Because when the record-keepers
        at\nEllis Island or wherever, when all these foreigners would come through
        they would just spell out\ntheir names phonetically, and so the names got
        altered, which makes it very difficult if you\u2019re\ndoing genealogy, which
        I\u2019m just obsessed with family history. So it makes it hard when you\njump
        overseas to connect up again on the trail.\nNow if I talk too much, you tell
        me to be quiet\u2014because I have a habit\u2014\nAW: No, this is great. Tell
        us about your family history. You said you were following the\nmigration\u2014?\nJO:
        Yes, on my father\u2019s side, his great-grandfather immigrated in the late
        1800s and they settled\nin Duluth. From there they moved more to the Iron
        Range to Coleraine and Bovey. That\u2019s where\nmy aunts and uncle lived
        and my cousins are still on the Iron Range. I still spend a lot of time up\nthere;
        we have a family cabin. On my mother\u2019s side they emigrated from Sweden
        through the\nGreat Lakes\u2014they settled in Rockford, just shortly. And
        then they went to rural Iowa and they\nwere one of the first three settlers
        in that region in 1881\/1882.\nAW: Which region of Iowa?\nJO: Laurens, it\u2019s
        in Pocahontas County. Before my mom passed away I wanted to know more\nabout
        her background. She didn\u2019t really talk much about her background and
        so I spent two\nmonths doing research and ordered documents and it was just
        a wonderful trip. I got in the car\nand I went to every house that my mom
        lived in\u2014except for her sorority house. I was all over\nthe place going
        to these houses. I made prior appointments, but street names have changed
        in the\nlast hundred years so I had to call up people and, \u201cWhat\u2019s
        the current street name?\u201d I\u2019d then\ncontact them and bring little
        gifts. My great-great-grandfather who emigrated from Sweden, we\nfound his
        house through the Pocahontas Courthouse; they had a team of people who helped.
        And\nwe went out and the house is still standing that my great-great-grandfather
        built in 1881. I sat in\nthe kitchen of that house and it was just awesome.
        When you trace your family\u2019s history\u2014and of\nmy siblings there\u2019s
        six children\u2014I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s interested in family history.
        I have all\nthese documents and files of things and I have all the old family
        Bibles and autograph books\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n3\nfrom
        way back, and so I\u2019m the historian in the family. I love it! Because
        all my sibs have\nchildren and grandchildren\u2014their meaning comes through
        looking at them and projecting.\nMine\u2019s going back because I don\u2019t
        have children. So I go back and I can create this script out of\nall these
        documents and books and things and create this script of their lives. So,
        my parents left,\nthey met at the University of Minnesota in the middle thirties.
        My mom was studying piano and\nmy dad was studying business and they fell
        in love and were married in 1940 in my\ngrandmother\u2019s house in Sioux
        Falls. I\u2019ve been in that house a number of times over the years--\nlast
        four or five years. I have a reel of their wedding from 1940. It was sixteen
        millimeter, and\nthere\u2019s my mom as a young woman and my dad as a twenty-one\u2014\nAW:
        Wow. Who had the video camera?\n00:06:22\nJO: My grandmother was a photographer.
        And it\u2019s in color\u2014color first came out in 1940. So I\nhad it made
        into videotape\u2014a CD\u2014and watched it.\nAW: So you had it converted
        to a CD?\nJO: I converted it. And of course all the people in there, no one\u2019s
        alive. But it\u2019s still, to be sitting\non that steps where they were when
        they were married in 1940\u2014it\u2019s brought enormous meaning\nand comfort.\nOn
        an aside, I remember in 1958, when we were going to stay with my grandmother,
        she had a\nKitchen Aid mixer and as a kid I just loved it. It was passed down
        to mom and now I have it. It\nwas made in 1947 and I use it nearly every day.
        It still just hums along and it\u2019s using my\ngrandmother\u2019s objects
        that I have a lot of. It connects me with my mother and my grandmother\nand
        my ancestors. That\u2019s my mom\u2019s jewelry right there\u2014(refers to
        jewelry on table).\nAW: Oh I see, these pieces.\nJO: This is interesting\u2014my
        mom\u2019s jewelry box\u2014I just kinda swiped it. I found out in my\nresearch
        that my grandfather was a doctor and he delivered my mom. The delivery went
        bad and\nmy grandmother died in the process. And so I found this (refers to
        locket)\u2014this is my\ngrandmother who died at twenty-three. I got this
        and it was all banged up in the back and I think\nwhat happened was that when
        she died and my mother was a little kid they gave her this locket\nto carry
        with her\u2014she was an only child\u2014and she must\u2019ve had it in her
        pocket and it\u2019s so worn.\nThat\u2019s the only reason why I think it\u2019s
        so banged up is she treasured that.\nAW: What was your grandmother\u2019s
        name?\nJO: Blanche Bowen.\nAW: And these other pieces here?\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n4\nJO: Those are my mom\u2019s
        things that she got in Mexico when I was fifteen and I always loved\nthem
        as a kid. And this all fits into my love of objects\u2014and Art Deco. Those
        are Art Deco\ninspired pieces. And that fits into what I\u2019m currently
        in love with and what I look at for source\nmaterial. (points to objects on
        table).\nAW: On the topic of the Kitchen Aid, what were some of the things
        that your mom made with it?\nAre there family recipes that you have?\nJO:
        I have some of those, and mom used to always make the Christmas bread in the\u2014Krumkake,\nit\u2019s
        a Swedish bread with candied fruit in it. And she\u2019d make a loaf for each
        of her six kids, but\nshe\u2019d always give me two loaves. I was her favorite.
        (Laughs) I was born two and a half months\nearly and so she was always very
        protective of me and I was a momma\u2019s boy and hung on to her\nand just
        adored my mom.\nAW: You said your grandparent\u2019s house was in Sweden,
        the house your grandfather built\u2014can\nyou describe it? You said you were
        sitting in the kitchen? Tell us more about that moment.\nJO: When we found
        the house and it was still standing the people at the courthouse were, you\nknow,
        crosschecking, and they said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s still there.\u201d So
        we got in the car and we found it.\nMom was raised in Laurens\u2014when I
        decided to go to Laurens for the first time to get\u2014I wanted\nto just
        find out more information. So, I called their genealogist society and this
        woman said,\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll do some research, we\u2019ll get back
        to you.\u201d And so the woman calls me up a month\nor so later: \u201cWe\u2019re
        related.\u201d I said, \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cBy marriage.\u201d So she
        did all the research in the\nMethodist Church and then she went with me to
        Pocahontas Courthouse in the neighboring town.\nWe found out where the house
        was and we were driving towards this house and she says, \u201cYou\nknow,
        I have a friend I hike with every day that\u2019s kind of in this area, so
        there\u2019s their house\u2014.\u201d\nAnd we pulled in and there was a house
        and I said, \u201cWow.\u201d\nA friend of mine\u2019s dating a guy from near
        that town\u2014who grew up in that town\u2014so he came for\ndinner last week.
        I had some old photographs of this town. I said, \u201cJoe, tell me now, I\u2019ll
        feed you\nif you recognize some things on here, the courthouse, this, and
        the other thing.\u201d And he said,\n(gasp)\u2014and that was my great grandfather\u2019s
        house there, that he built\u2014and he says, \u201cI\u2019ve been\nin that
        house, we had a farm right near there. And that\u2019s Doug, he was my high
        school friend.\u201d\nHe knew my relative by marriage, who\u2019s eighty years
        old that did a lot of the research, and\n\u201cWell, I know her.\u201d So
        it\u2019s just wonderful. To me in life, what I love more than anything is\nconnecting\u2014making
        these connections with people and events and tying them all together.\nThat\u2019s
        my gift and it was my mom\u2019s gift.\nAW: How so? Tell us a little bit more
        about that. Your mom\u2019s gift\u2014how did she make those\nconnections
        happen?\nJO: My mom and dad were quite different. My dad was very quiet, kind
        of an introvert. My mom\nwas very outgoing and so throughout her whole life
        she would pull people together. She still\nwould see her sorority sisters
        from the thirties until she became too frail; she was in her eighties\nthen.
        And she was still\u2014she just pulled people together. Our household was
        just chaotic with six\nkids and she,--to add to the chaos--she would have
        foreign exchange students come and stay with\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n5\nus too. Thinking we need to, you know,
        make this even richer, so we had exchange students in\nour home, and crazy
        misplaced relatives. It was just a very wild, fun household growing up.\nAW:
        Where did you grow up?\nJO: White Bear Lake.\nAW: When were you born?\nJO:
        Nineteen hundred forty-seven, December 7th\u2014that\u2019s Pearl Harbor Day.
        And that\u2019s the day\nthat my mom died, on my birthday. My dad died six
        months before on my ten year anniversary\nin AA, in recovery, so these two
        dates, it\u2019s like (whispers) \u201cgo figure.\u201d\nIt took me a long
        time to unravel what those hidden gifts, what they meant. They were honoring\nme
        in their own way. So what I do now on my parents\u2019 birthdays I have people
        come up with\u2014\nand now back to piano. I have another family of people
        in my life: pianists. I have a great teacher\nfrom Marine on St. Croix. We\u2019d
        have musical events up here on my parents\u2019 birthdays; we give\nthem virtual
        presents of music on their birthdays. And then we have a meal and we all play,
        or\npeople sing, or people play their instruments, or whatever they do. They
        have to all play or do\nsomething for their supper. It\u2019s just so much
        fun. (Laughs) Do you want to come to one?! You\nhave to play though.\nAW:
        Yes, I would love to! So tell us about these pianos\u2014you have two grand
        pianos in here?\nJO: Yes, my passion\u2019s always been classical piano. But
        in high school I played show tunes\n(Laughs). But then later on, just classical
        music was it. Classical piano, it\u2019s just all I\u2019d listen to.\nAnd
        this is how it happened. I\u2019ve always had a piano of various kinds but
        never played it; it was\nfor friends. My mom ended up in a nursing home\u2014she
        was ninety\u2014and she didn\u2019t have a long\nor short-term memory. And
        in my search for my mom\u2019s background, I found her only surviving\nhigh
        school classmate. There were thirty-four in her class. I just found her; I
        did a lot of research.\nShe\u2019s still alive at ninety-six; she\u2019s writing
        her second book. She was my mom\u2019s best friend and\nsaid, \u201cYour mom
        was an amazing pianist. She would enter competitions throughout Iowa. She\nplayed
        in the orchestra; she played at church.\u201d And I didn\u2019t know this\u2014she
        stopped playing in\n1940 to raise her kids. She never went back. And so Lucille
        sent me a roster of mom playing in a\ncompetition in 1933. She played a piece
        by Edward MacDowell, who was a contemporary\ncomposer. So I sent it to a friend
        who\u2019s a pianist, who recorded it. So I went to the nursing home,\nbecause
        I have all mom\u2019s music from childhood. So I thought, \u201cI have that
        music.\u201d So I took it\ninto the nursing home and I said, \u201cMom, do
        you remember playing this?\u201d And she said \u201cNo.\u201d So\nI turned
        on the recorder and she was turning the pages, she was reading the music.
        I said,\n\u201cWow,\u201d and I said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to piano.\u201d
        So I went in every other day for a lesson. And\nthat\u2019s mom right there,
        she\u2019s ninety\u2014we looked at the piano and she would just light up,
        she\nwould get right in the zone, missed a beat, that\u2019s the wrong note,
        she just came alive. That\u2019s how\nwe communicated because she wasn\u2019t
        talking much. So, that\u2019s how we connected. And that was\nher final gift,
        was the gift of piano.\nAnd so, I just decided I want really great pianos.
        I did research and I wanted a Mason & Hamlin\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n6\nfrom the golden era that could be
        rebuilt because they were great pianos. This one came from\nNew York and I
        had it rebuilt and refinished. And then a year later, I want another piano.
        I found\nthis one at midnight; it\u2019s a seven foot Mason & Hamlin. I was
        looking on craigslist, there\u2019s a\npiano, a Mason & Hamlin, this was built
        in 1917, my mother\u2019s birth year. So her soul is in this\npiano. I had
        to move the Earth to get it, to finance, refinance. I sold a bunch of stuff.
        It arrived;\nit\u2019s rebuilt, refinished.\nA woman bought it for her son
        in 1974 who was a very accomplished pianist at fourteen\u2014played\nwith
        the Boston Pops\u2014and he went on to study piano at Harvard, and his teacher
        just destroyed\nhis sense of confidence. So he came to play it last year,
        he flew out with his partner, and he\nplayed his childhood piano and we had
        a couple days together, and so\u2014these pianos have\nbrought this rich circle
        of friends and connections to people, and\u2014\nAW: What was that like? To
        connect with this young man who\u2014?\n00:17:20\nJO: Well, he\u2019s now
        fifty-some. He and his partner flew out, but there\u2019s\u2014\nAW: So, was
        he selling the piano or what\u2019s his\u2014?\nJO: His mother was.\nAW: His
        mother was?\nJO: Yeah, because he was living in California and his mother\u2014they
        had to sell their house, they\nwere in their eighties\u2014and it just broke
        her heart because she also played. And so I called her up\nand I said, \u201cI
        want to buy your piano.\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, are you going to come
        play it?\u201d And\nI said, \u201cWell, I live in Minnesota.\u201d She thought
        I was scamming her. But the odd thing about this\nwas, she talked in such
        a way that I thought, \u201cHe\u2019s an only child.\u201d And\u2014he then
        switched to\nstudying law, immigration. So, I just had this feeling. I had
        a feeling that he was a gay, as I am,\nso I just kept going on the computer
        tch tch tch\u2014 I found him in California, and up came a\npartner, Tom.
        It\u2019s so bizarre. So, we became friends. We correspond and he\u2019s been
        out and\nthey\u2019ll come out again.\nAW: Wow. That\u2019s a great example
        of, like you were saying, of these connections\u2014the meaning\nof objects
        and connecting people. That\u2019s just really incredible. What did you guys
        play? Did you\nguys do duets at all?\nJO: No, he played my favorite piece
        I heard two years ago: a Brahms Intermezzo 117. I heard it,\nI said to Mary,
        \u201cI have to learn this, I have to.\u201d It\u2019s way beyond me, just
        way beyond me. I spent\na year on two pages and I learned it, then it got
        sidetracked. You give me a project and we\u2019ll do\nit. He played that,
        that\u2019s his signature piece. And when he came out, another person that
        came\nout was the Steinway rep from Schmidt Music. He\u2019s a friend of my
        teachers\u2019 and her husband\ndied and that\u2019s what his favorite song\u2014that\u2019s
        what was played at his funeral. So it just has these\nmultiple meanings. And
        it\u2019s just an amazing piece. Do you know the piece?\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n7\nAW: I can\u2019t conjure
        it up at this moment but I wrote it down so I\u2019ll go and check it out.
        Can you\nstill play a little bit?\nJO: No, I\u2019m on Sicilienne, the Faur\u00e9
        piece.\nAW: Oh that\u2019s right, yeah. Now which piece is this?\nJO: It\u2019s
        a Faur\u00e9 piece, it\u2019s Sicilienne; it\u2019s a very well-known piece
        for piano and flute. I did\nrehearse a bit with a woman who played the bass
        out in California. A woman, Carol Sauvion,\nwho did this series on craft in
        America for public TV. You know that series? Carol used to be\nmarried to
        Don McLean who did \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d and \u201cStarry Starry Night,\u201d
        if you know those\nsongs. Then they divorced before he made it big so they
        were really poor. She remarried and her\nson was nine and they were driving
        in the mountains and her husband got out to chain\u2014put the\nchains on
        the car. He got back in the car and just died of a heart attack right there.
        And this poor\nkid was so distraught that they, you know, therapy, and she
        sold the house to get a different\nhouse. He grew up and he went to study
        bass at Bloomington and then he went to either Eastman\nor Oberlin. Someone
        stepped forward and gave him sixty-five thousand dollars for a bass. And\nnow
        his partner also plays the bass. So I practiced with her out in California,
        at Carol\u2019s house.\nBut there\u2019s something about\u2014I was in a twelve
        year relationship with another potter up until\n1996. He was here this last
        year and we played a duet together and it was just so, so, so neat, just\nso
        neat to do that. And then I was thinking, I have to find people in my life
        who really inspire\nme. When you\u2019re a child it just takes one person
        to open the door to show you your future. And\nso I was able to find my high
        school art teacher. So he came out with his wife. And then I invited\ntwo
        friends who were friends of mine from high school and it was just so neat.
        I had to trace\nback to who fired my love of piano\u2014my sixth\/seventh
        grade junior high teacher, music teacher.\nI found her. She was still alive
        so she came up with my piano teacher. We played duets and stuff,\nit was just
        so neat, because I just adored this woman, Helen. When she came up I said,
        \u201cHelen,\nI\u2019m not going to feed you until you change my report card.\u201d
        (Laughs). I had that report card that\nmom saved, they save everything you
        know, so, \u201cThere it is, over there.\u201d I said, \u201cChange it to
        an\nA.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay\u201d I said, \u201cNo, Helen, I want an
        A+.\u201d (Laughs). Then we had a meal and we\nplayed a duet together; it
        was just so neat.\nI just love doing that\u2014bringing people together. That
        was my mom\u2019s gift; she was good at it.\nDad was off doing his other stuff,
        you know. But all this, you know, how it fits is that I come\nfrom a family
        of makers. We all made objects. I made potholders and trivets. And I still
        have\nthem when I clean out the house. I use them in my slide presentation
        because you think back and\nif something gets instilled\u2014and my brother
        made leather purses and saddles, my sisters made\nclothing and they knit.
        So the house is always\u2014there were always prams all over the place and\nall
        that happening. But my older brother, he made trouble, and my dad made money.
        That\u2019s what\nI say, (Laughs), they didn\u2019t make things.\n00:23:12\nAW:
        (Laughs) How did your parents meet in the 1930s? You said at the U of M [University
        of\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n8\nMinnesota]
        and then they moved into a place in White Bear Lake?\nJO: They moved to White
        Bear Lake in the early forties in to a house in Birchwood. It\u2019s a little\nenclave
        off of the lake with maybe fifty houses. A couple years ago I kept having
        this dream\nabout that house\u2014I just couldn\u2019t get it out of my head.
        That house was sold in 1958, we moved\ndown to the lake. So, I thought, This
        is just nuts. I said, \u201cWhat is it telling me?\u201d I said, \u201cI have
        to\ngo to that house.\u201d So I went to the house and my friend, my high
        school, my babysitter, lives\ndown the road from me from when I was a kid
        and so, \u201cWell, I know those people, I\u2019ll get ya in\nthere.\u201d
        So I went there and there was an old, old couple there and I just remembered
        the same\nsidewalk, I remembered the crack, I remember this window, I remembered
        it all\u2014I left there\nwhen I was ten. And then they had me stay for dinner.
        But to see these old people there, they\nwere sitting in the same place where
        our couch was and have them serve dinner and it\u2014you\nknow, sixty years
        later, fifty\u2014it was just profound, it was just amazing.\nAW: Did you
        get a chance to walk through the house and see your old bedroom?\nJO: I did.\nAW:
        So that couple that bought it, that\u2019s been there\u2014?\nJO: They\u2019ve
        been there forty years.\nAW: Wow.\nJO: He just passed away. So the house is
        going to be on the market and I was thinking, \u201cI wanted\nto buy the house
        and move there.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s not practical,
        but again\nit\u2019s\u2014with all this that\u2019s happened in the sixties\u2014for
        me\u2014it\u2019s all about searching for meaning,\nmore meaning in my life.
        That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. And people do it in various ways.\nAW: It
        sounds like for you one way has been to reconnect with teachers, friends,
        people of your\npast, as well as new people that you\u2019re meeting.\nJO:
        Yes, right.\nAW: Can you tell us more examples of searching for meaning in
        your life?\nJO: It\u2019s the meaning comes from people, connecting with people.
        So I got an email from Craig\nRasmussen who\u2019s Warren\u2019s son-in-law
        and he said, \u201cI\u2019m curating an exhibition in White Bear\nLake at
        the White Bear Center for the Arts, would you send a piece or two?\u201d I
        said, \u201cSure.\u201d And\nhis address when he emailed me was this address
        in Bircher, where our first house was. I said,\n\u201cDo you live in the Butler
        house?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s just around the corner.\u201d So I was
        thinking of the\nButler family that I knew as a kid. They had six children,
        they had five boys and then they had a\ngirl, and they named them all in alphabetical
        order. I thought, Oh, Ellie Butler, she couldn\u2019t be\nalive. She\u2019d
        be in her nineties, couldn\u2019t be. He said, \u201cYeah, she\u2019s alive,
        she\u2019s just a spitfire, and\nshe\u2019s like five feet tall.\u201d I looked
        up their address and then I did an aerial view and said, \u201cThat\u2019s\nmy
        high school art teachers\u2019 house.\u201d They bought that house when they
        moved when they were\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n9\nold.
        There was a for sale sign on it and I said, \u201cOh no, they\u2019re dead
        now.\u201d So I thought, Hmm. I\ncalled the church and he said, \u201cOh they\u2019re
        still alive, they\u2019re over at this nursing home, they\u2019re\nover in
        Mahtomedi at the St. Andrew\u2019s.\u201d I could not help myself. I should
        have been packing\npots, I should have been working. I said, \u201cI have
        to go see them.\u201d I just got in the car and drove\ndown there\u2014I just
        could not stop myself\u2014to just connect with these people after fifty-some\nyears.
        But they weren\u2019t there, but I\u2019ll try again. So that\u2019s an example
        of what it\u2019s all about.\nAW: That\u2019s really amazing. I bet we\u2019ll
        have more examples and stories as we continue on here.\nTell us a little bit
        about your siblings then.\nJO: Mom had three boys then she had three girls.
        She was very orderly, two years apart, except\nthe last one is four years
        apart, and she arrived with red hair.\nAW: Special.\nJO: Right and, of course,
        she got teased because we all have dark hair, she got so teased. But it\nends
        up that we\u2019re just soul mates, we\u2019re very close. We are, kind of,
        the wounded of the family.\nWe\u2019re the ones that\u2014we kind of felt
        we didn\u2019t fit. We were the last ones to be chosen when you\nwere selected
        for a baseball team or something. We were always the last one. So we have
        the\nsame life issues, we\u2019re just the same. We get on the phone, we get
        right into therapy (Laughs).\nAW: And what\u2019s her name?\nJO: That\u2019s
        Nancy. She\u2019s a gifted flutist and she went to St. Olaf to study flute.
        Midway through\nshe changed careers, she was anxious about how to make a living,
        but she was exceptional. She\nwas first chair in high school. She was so good.
        And she just changed, and it\u2019s just, it\u2019s\nheartbreaking. So at
        Christmas time I made her get out her flute, she hadn\u2019t touched it in
        ten\nyears. \u201cWe\u2019re going to practice this piece now, get with it
        now.\u201d\nAW: And how did she do? Did she just pick it up?\nJO: Yeah.\nAW:
        Wow, that\u2019s great.\nJO: You know, it\u2019s the flute, and she was in
        college, she was getting discouraged so my parents,\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d
        This is what my parents were made of: they went to England and they went\nto
        the British Flute Guild, where they make the best, some of the best flutes
        in the world, and\nbought her, had made a silver flute for her and gave it
        to her.\n00:29:05\nAW: You said, \u201cThat\u2019s what your parents were
        made of\u2014\u201d What do you mean by that?\nJO: Well, when I was in college
        studying ceramics I got discouraged, so my dad built a building\nfor me and
        bought me a kiln, and it encouraged me. That\u2019s just what they did; they
        were so\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n10\nbehind
        their children. For them they always believed, We don\u2019t care what you
        do, you have to be\nhappy with what you\u2019re doing. And so, when I told
        them I\u2019m going to be a potter, they didn\u2019t\nfreak out. They said,
        \u201cGreat.\u201d In fact when I was\u2014I discovered clay in high school.
        I remember\nplopping that clay down on that little wheel for the first time\u2014it
        was a little tabletop, you know,\nhobby wheel. Wow, this is just magic, it
        just took over. Then I went off to Bemidji State and\ntook my pottery class
        there.\nThe one person who was instrumental in pushing me into the art field
        was my Aunt Judy, who\nwas very eccentric and she had this enormous life.
        She died in seventy-two, I think it was, and\nshe was trained as a commercial
        artist in the forties. It was called commercial before it was\ncalled graphic
        arts. And she just had a wild life, she never married, I think she was lesbian.
        She\nhad bright red hair and long pointed, painted fingernails, and she always
        wore black fishnet\nstockings, everything was black capes. She was just very
        dramatic with this deep voice and she\nsmoked Pall Mall Straights and she
        drank a lot. And I couldn\u2019t wait to grow up and smoke Pall\nMall Straights
        and drink a lot\u2014which I did, couldn\u2019t wait. And she would come to
        visit us a lot,\nbut she\u2019d bring her paints and show us how to paint
        and do craft projects. She joined the\nWAVES during the war, then the war\u2019s
        over and she went to work for a paint company doing\ncolor consulting and
        then she did TV commercials. And then she did this\u2014she just really had\nfun
        with her life. She was the one who encouraged me. It was her that I wanted
        to grow up and\nbe an artist. I just thought this is really cool. A lot of
        family were kind of\u2014because she was\nmoody and temperamental, but I just
        adored her. When she was fifty-five she decided to go back\nto school, she
        wanted to teach high school art and so she went to Bemidji State.\nI ended
        up there because I wasn\u2019t a great student in high school but they would
        take me. And she\ntold me, \u201cWhen you get there take this pottery class
        from Westy James, it will change your life.\u201d\nSo, as an incoming freshman
        I did, and I knew right away that I would be a potter. So, I kept on\ntaking
        more classes and I was getting closer to graduation. I transferred to the
        University of\nMinnesota in the process and I said to Warren MacKenzie, \u201cI
        want to go work at the Leach\nPottery.\u201d The Leach Pottery is a pottery
        in St. Ives, England that was one of the first potteries\nstarted by a contemporary
        potter, Bernard Leach, in 1920. They took apprentices; they took one\neach
        year. Warren studied there in the early fifties, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll
        write you a letter of\nrecommendation.\u201d\nSo, I flew over there with my
        parents for this interview. So that shows my parents\u2019 support. And\nthey
        said, \u201cCome back in a year\u2019s time.\u201d I had to do one more year
        of school, so I was all set to\ngo. About a week before [leaving] they had
        the draft and I remember being in the student lounge\nat Bemidji State\u2014because
        I went back up there for my last year\u2014we were watching this on TV,\nmy
        friends, my brother-in-law. They\u2019re pulling numbers out of a barrel and
        I came up number\nseven. And I thought, Oh crap, what am I going to do now?
        I\u2019ve got this opportunity of a\nlifetime. What do I do now? I flunked
        the physical so I was able to go. My parents came over\nwhen I was living
        there three or four times, just to visit, and they fell in love with this
        town of St.\nIves. It\u2019s an old fishing village from the thirteenth century,
        the very southwest tip of England.\nAnd they fell in love with this town,
        they went there, this town in their lifetime, seventy-seven\ntimes.\nThey
        just loved it with all their heart. When they passed away I wanted to go back
        to Leach\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n11\nPottery
        and have an exhibition in their honor and spread their ashes there. They said,
        \u201cCome on\nover.\u201d So I went there and the pottery, it\u2019s all
        changed, it\u2019s an institution now, they built more\nbuildings, and the
        pottery that we were\u2014it\u2019s a museum now. And they said, \u201cYou
        can work in\nthe new place or you can work in the museum,\u201d which is cold
        and dank, no heat. I said, \u201cI want\nto work in that same corner I did
        forty years ago.\u201d So they put a wheel there. I got on that wheel\nagain
        and I just relived my life.\nThe exhibition I titled 77 x 77, I had seventy-seven
        pots for the seventy-seven trips there. I rented\nthe flat they rented and
        I slept in their bed. The morning of the exhibition, Dell, who was mom\u2019s\noldest
        friend who was eighty, we went and spread their ashes in town, then went to
        the opening.\nIt was a very emotional trip there because I grieve for my parents
        and I grieve for the town that I\nloved forty years before, which is now all
        classy. It was a working fishing village and artist\ncolony that went way
        back to the 1880s. They had a town crier, they had little vegetable shops\u2014\nand
        it\u2019s all [now] high-end houses. Back then they were two thousand dollars,
        now they\u2019re half a\nmillion. These rich people from London, they bought
        out property there, so it\u2019s all changed.\nThey can\u2019t change the
        building because they\u2019re all historic, from the thirteenth century, but
        I\ngrieve for the town that I loved. I grieve for my parents. It was just
        highs and lows.\nI had the opening on a Saturday night. I had a picture of
        my parents from when they were on\ntheir twenty-eighth trip. The mayor heard
        about this couple who had been there so many times,\nso my parents were interviewed
        and they were on TV, they had a party. I have a picture of them\nshaking the
        mayor\u2019s hand way back when. So I took it to the newspaper, the St. Ives
        Times and\nthey go, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll do a spread on this.\u201d They did
        this big spread with old pictures of my folks\nand me and then newer ones\u2014it
        was basically to invite people who were still alive to come to\nthe opening.
        It was just packed. I left the opening and I just started sobbing. I said,
        \u201cOkay I can\nnever come back here again, it\u2019s over now.\u201d I
        said, \u201cNo, I have to come back.\u201d So I\u2019m going\nback in October,
        again with Pat, my friend who\u2019s in Portland, to do a residency and have
        an\nexhibition.\nSo, I\u2019ve been pulled back again. Like my parents were
        being pulled back, I\u2019m being pulled back\nagain. I\u2019ll never make
        it seventy times, but I\u2019ve been there maybe a dozen times. I\u2019m pulled
        back\nthere for this\u2014I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019m just pulled back
        there. It\u2019s to feel closer to my parents and\nto see my friends who I
        had there. But it was so odd going back there and seeing friends\u2014the\nman
        that trained me in, who was a very well known potter, Bill Marshall, who is
        no longer alive.\nWhen I lived there I helped his daughter, who was eleven,
        do her homework. So I went back to\nsee her, I hadn\u2019t seen her for forty
        years. So I knocked on her door, she opens it, and I said, \u201cJo?\u201d\nIt\u2019s
        just so strange (gasp). \u201cJo.\u201d So I went inside, she made a pie,
        and we just talked. Her mother\nwas still alive, Marjorie, who I hadn\u2019t
        seen for forty years. She\u2019s in her eighties.\nAnd then I went to see
        Sheila. I worked with her husband, Alan Brough, who\u2019s no longer alive\nand
        Sheila\u2019s in her mid-to-late seventies. So, \u201cCome over, I\u2019ll
        meet you at so-and-so.\u201d I get out\nof the cab and I was looking, I was
        trying to find her, and there was this old lady walking down\nthe street,
        she had pink and purple hair. I said, \u201cNo way,\u201d but, \u201cSheila?!\u201d
        \u201cYes!\u201d And we just\nhugged and just went inside and had this wonderful
        meal and just talked, talked, talked, talked.\nIt\u2019s one of the gifts
        of being older, is connecting with people from your past. It is just so much\nfun
        to do that.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n12\n00:37:50\nAW:
        So, what drew you there in the very beginning? Why were you so interested
        in going to\napprentice there?\nJO: Because when I started pottery in the
        sixties, there were only three books out on ceramics.\nAnd the one that was
        called \u201cthe Bible\u201d was The Potters\u2019 Book by Bernard Leach.
        I have an old,\nworn copy from when I was a freshman, so all kinds of notes
        in it and everything. And so this\nman, he wrote this, and became very well
        known throughout the world, and so he had this\npottery and it was through
        just worshiping that book, and his philosophy, and the pots, and\nknowing
        that Warren went there. I just said, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m going to
        do.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to go\non to graduate school to be a pottery
        teacher I just wanted to be a potter. I knew that that would\ntrain me.\nBut
        I have to tell you this other story, I don\u2019t know how it relates but
        that Potter\u2019s Book is no\nlonger in print. Mine\u2019s just worn and
        tattered, and everyone knows it\u2019s, just, it\u2019s \u201cthe Bible\u201d
        from\nback then. So in March, I was just missing my mom\u2014and I do get
        signs that she\u2019s around me\nand in me, I just get these signs\u2014and
        I was out there one night and said, \u201cOh mom, just give me\na sign that
        you\u2019re still part of my life, that you\u2019re within me, you love me.\u201d
        Nothing happened.\nYou cannot demand a sign. It has to happen when it\u2019s
        gonna happen. So, next day I was at Tim\nHeil\u2019s, who\u2019s a friend
        of mine\u2014I\u2019ve known him for forty years, he\u2019s been collecting
        my pots for\nforty years, he has like a thousand of my pots. He\u2019s just
        an amazing man. He\u2019s a truck broker by\nday and he\u2019s a woodturner
        by night, and a collector of pots. And he just loves handmade\neverything.
        His house, you go in and there\u2019s a handmade boat hanging from the ceiling.
        He just\nloves handmade everything, he\u2019s just crazy about handmade things.
        His daughter was there,\nwho\u2019s about to go off to England to study art,
        who I\u2019m very good friends with, and we\u2019ve been\nemailing. She was
        at a used bookstore, before her birthday party at Tim\u2019s house, and she\u2019s
        at a\nused bookstore called Half Price, near her house. She was in the travel
        section trying to find\nsome books about London and there was this misfiled
        book, a pottery book for ten bucks, so she\nbought it. And we\u2019re talking,
        the guests left after the birthday cake, and we\u2019re just yakking, Tim\nand
        his wife were there, and she said \u201cI found this pottery book at the bookstore
        for ten bucks,\nit\u2019s called A Potter\u2019s something.\u201d And I said,
        \u201cA Potter\u2019s Song?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019ll go get it.\u201d She
        got it,\nand I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s The Potter\u2019s Book!\u201d
        She opened it up, and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom\u2019s\nhandwriting.\u201d
        (Whispers) It was my mother\u2019s book.\nAnd I said, \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d
        I was just ready to sob, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s her handwriting.\u201d
        And in the\nfront mom would always tape stuff, and there was a taped card
        of one of Leach\u2019s pots. And I\nsaid, \u201cLet\u2019s keep looking, I
        know there are other articles, she\u2019d stuff articles in books.\u201d And
        sure\nenough, there are articles about his death in there and on their stationary
        from their home was\nsome random notes about various stuff. But that was a
        sign, and I\u2019ll never ever doubt that again.\nWhen she\u2019s with me,
        she\u2019s taking care of me, overseeing, she\u2019s part of it\u2014dad too.\nJulie
        said, \u201cYou can have this book.\u201d \u201cNo, could I have the one letter?\u201d
        I said, \u201cNow this has a\nwonderful history to it.\u201d So now she does,
        she\u2019s studying pottery as well, but so bizarre.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n13\n00:41:35\nAW: So, she\u2019s
        kept the book?\nJO: Yeah.\nAW: What drew your parents to go back to your studio
        and go to St. Ives again and again and\nagain?\nJO: They just love this village
        because it\u2019s just like stepping back in time. And when they came\nover
        to visit me\u2014they came over four times when I lived there\u2014and they
        just fell in love with\nthe town and my friends. What they did was they kept
        my friendships alive. And mom would\nalways bring on the plane a frozen turkey,
        and she\u2019d make a big turkey dinner for my friends\nthere. And that was
        just so mom, she was just very giving. And next door to their flat there was
        a\nman who was mentally handicapped, who was a painter, who became very well
        known in his\nlife. He passed away maybe ten years ago, Bryan Pierce, extremely
        well known painter, but he\nwas mentally handicapped. And when Bryan came
        home one day\u2014all Bryan does was play with\nhis train set and painted,
        until he died\u2014he came home one day and his father was dead on the\nfloor
        and he just stepped over him and started doing his, it didn\u2019t register\u2014but
        he was this\nbrilliant painter. So they lived next door to mom. Mom would
        cook meals for them and they\u2019d\ninvite them for dinner. But that was
        just my mom, she was very giving, very generous. So they\nloved this town
        and kept going back and they had friends and friendships and they just loved
        it.\nThey kept going back until they couldn\u2019t walk anymore. So they kept
        my friendships alive and\ntheir flat was on the other side where Bernard Leach
        lived. And he was old, he was in his\nnineties then, so he was lonely, so
        they would visit with him too. So they kept that friendship\nalive too. They
        were this courier between England and me and that was a gift.\nAW: What about
        going back to when you got off the plane and went to the studio that very
        first\ntime. Can you tell us more about that experience?\nJO: I was so freaked
        out. I thought I was a pretty good potter, so I walked into this place, I
        got\nthere early\u2014and that\u2019s not me, I\u2019m always late\u2014and
        I got there early and I went into the stock\nroom and there were just thousands
        of pots piled up on racks. And I thought, \u201cOh man, I really\ngot myself
        into such a jam here.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, I can\u2019t do this, but when
        I make a commitment I\nstick to it. It was two years, and so, day one, Bill
        Marshall would train me in. I had a wheel\nacross from him. He took out a
        bowl and then he made one just like that\u2014you know production\nlines\u2014and
        he said, \u201cOkay, make twenty of these.\u201d And I thought, Oh, I can
        make twenty in two\nyears, and he meant twenty by noon! They had to be of
        a certain height and a certain weight\nwithin like a sixteenth of an inch,
        they had to be spot-on. And he said, \u201cThis is wrong, this is\nwrong,
        this is wrong,\u201d and tossed them away. For two months I tossed away maybe
        a hundred a\nday, but just kept tossing them away. Tossing \u2018em away,
        like this is wrong, this is wrong, this is\nwrong. And what that one bowl
        did, it just humbled me and I realized that good pots are a\ncomposite of
        all this nuance. You have to look at every single part of the piece is critical,
        to kind\nof sum up to be this good pot. So that\u2019s what I learned from
        that, the thing of critical observation\nand importance of every nuance. So
        it\u2019s basically just that kind of training, just be so observant.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n14\nBut I can now see\u2014and
        now that I\u2019m back to playing the piano\u2014they\u2019re so similar in
        terms of\nhow one approaches it. My teacher: it\u2019s scales, it\u2019s triads.
        I went to my first lesson three years\nago and I practiced this Bach piece
        for like a month. So I sit down, and I call, I said, \u201cMary, this\nis
        Jeff Oestreich, I heard about you.\u201d And a friend told me she was a really
        old-fashioned teacher\nand I thought, Oh great. I wanted the best teacher
        around. And so I get there, \u201cHello, now here\u2019s\nthe piano\u2014sit
        down and play something.\u201d So I open up the Bach, I play two measures
        and she\nsays, \u201cStop, shut the book.\u201d And it was triads like a month
        or so, triads and scales, over and over.\nAnd I\u2019m trying to think\u2014but
        that\u2019s necessary to build this foundation. It\u2019s the same with pots,\nyou
        have to make this pot a thousand times before you really get it. So they\u2019re
        cousins.\n00:46:12\nAW: What were some of the nuances that you were starting
        to notice? When making these pots,\nwhat were some of the things you started
        to see and you had to do to\u2014\nJO: Anything added on, any kind of line,
        where lines were put on, any kind of lugs or detail\nwhere the brush would
        hit, all this subtlety, anything that you added onto the form. And also the\nsurface
        of the pot had to be interesting, couldn\u2019t be flat, had to have some
        music to it. And the lip\nhad to be just right too, and how that was shaped.
        So every single thing had to be just spot-on.\nWhen I look at my training
        there, Bernard then was in his eighties, he didn\u2019t train us in, he\ncriticized,
        he would critique our one-of-a-kind pieces that we\u2019d make on weekends
        or evenings.\nThe production-ware that we kind of, we cut our teeth on, that
        was made, we made that forty\nhours a week. So when I arrived there I was
        paid fifteen dollars a week, and you could just\nsqueeze by. Five dollars
        went to your rent, five went to the pub, and five went for groceries, and\nyou
        could just squeak by. You could work some overtime, you get twenty-five cents
        an hour\novertime. But we were so poor. We didn\u2019t think we were poor
        though, we were all in the same\nboat and when you come from college to there,
        it\u2019s all the same thing. And my first flat that I\nrented was the size
        of\u2014from the fireplace, the edge of that wall to where the bricks are
        to here,\nthe whole apartment, that whole thing. There was a tiny little bedroom
        that I had to sleep\ndiagonal in the bed because it was only five feet wide,
        the bedroom. The living room had a\nkitchen that folded out from the wall.
        There was no fridge, people didn\u2019t have fridges back then.\nSo, it was
        just tiny, and you shared the bathroom in the hallway and in the basement
        there was a\nbathtub, you\u2019d share that with the people in the other two
        flats. We didn\u2019t think we were poor,\nthough; this is just our life.\nThere
        were many times I was very unhappy there, feeling I was exploited. I remember
        Janet\nLeach ran the place, it was Bernard\u2019s third wife. She was actually
        a Texan, who was thirty-five\nyears younger. And she was just tough as nails,
        and she just smoked like a fiend and drank\u2014\nalcoholic, and we got along:
        just a hard, tough Texan who used to weld ships during the war. She\nwas a
        boss there. Once I was thinking, I made a hundred bowls and they were sold
        for two\npounds apiece, I thought, A hundred times that and I\u2019m only
        getting this much from all that? So I\nentered her office and I said, \u201cJanet,
        I make a hundred bowls a day and they\u2019re selling for like\ntwo pounds
        apiece and you\u2019re only paying us\u2014I think I need a raise.\u201d She
        said, \u201cNo.\u201d So I just\nwent back on the wheel and got going, \u201cGrrrrr.\u201d
        So there were times I was unhappy, I felt\nexploited. But cocky American\u2014we
        have no idea what the apprenticeship system is about here,\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n15\nit\u2019s a dead system
        here. It\u2019s coming back though, in some fields. So I had nothing to compare
        it\nto, so it is, in a sense, it\u2019s slave labor, but you learn, that\u2019s
        how you learn.\nAnd mom saved everything. Mom saved all my letters I wrote
        back home every week to them.\nYou know, a couple times a week I\u2019d write
        a letter back and aerogram, they had those back then.\nAnd if you wanted to
        call them, which they did once a year, you\u2019d have to call the operator
        and\nsay, \u201cI want to call America.\u201d And they\u2019ll say, \u201cOkay,
        we\u2019ll call you when we get a free line.\u201d\nThen you just hang up,
        then maybe an hour later, or two, you\u2019d get a call, \u201cOperator, okay
        we\nhave a line for you Mr. Oestreich.\u201d You\u2019d talk for a minute
        or two. So now, you just get out that\ncell phone and you Skype it\u2014\nBut
        anyway, how you felt so far away, you\u2019re at the end of the earth. So
        I wrote those letters.\nTowards the end there\u2019s a lot of anxiety about
        how I\u2019m going to make a living and I know I can\ndo it, I know I can
        do it, but\u2014Bernard and Janet were in Japan traveling and weren\u2019t
        going to be\nback in time for my departure. They sent a telegram that they
        were going to be a week late, if I\ncould please stay. I just said, \u201cNo,
        I\u2019m getting the hell out of here. You\u2019ve got my two years to\nthe
        day, I\u2019m going to come back to America and I\u2019m getting my pottery
        going, I\u2019m just going to\nshow people I can do this.\u201d And so I never
        saw Bernard again, he died not too long after that. I\nregret\u2014I wish
        I would\u2019ve stayed that extra week. But I did go back and see Janet a
        number of\ntimes, but I didn\u2019t see Bernard again, because of my\u2014I
        just had to get out of there, I just wanted\nto do it now. I\u2019m trained
        now, I want to be a potter, and so\u2014\n00:51:25\nAW: When Bernard did the
        critiques, what was that like?\nJO: They\u2019re short and to the point, and
        he could sum up a pot with just a gesture or one sentence.\nIt\u2019s not
        how critiques are now in universities. Now critiques go on hours, and I can
        make them\ngo on for hours. You get me going on a pot and it\u2019s just di
        di di di. But just one sentence and he\nwould just sum it up. He could just
        see it and just tsh tsh tsh, get to the point and\u2014 But it was\u2014I\nmean
        this was forty years ago\u2014but now you go off to teach\u2014one thing that\u2019s
        happened over the\nlast couple, three decades, this whole language has been
        developed about how we talk about\ncrafts and how we talk about pots. Attach
        it to metaphor or this or that and the other, and how\nthis is a much more
        richer language of how to talk about pots. But back then there really wasn\u2019t
        a\nwhole lot of language and how we talked about pots. It was through observation,
        and osmosis,\nthrough comparison, a couple sentences\u2014the field was young
        then. Now there are thousands of\nbooks, there\u2019s a lot more than three
        now.\nAW: Who were some of your colleagues, who were apprentices as well?\nJO:
        John Bedding, who\u2019s my age. When I arrived they had four apprentices
        and then they had a\ncouple of full time workers, and some \u201codd bods\u201d
        who would do clay mixing and such. I was an\nAmerican, there was a woman from
        Australia, I replaced a woman, Chantel who was French, and\nthere was a Japanese
        potter there who just arrived. So there was always a mix of people. When I\nwas
        there actually I was pretty stable because Shigeyoshi had just arrived, the
        Japanese man. The\nJapanese man and I, we became close because we arrived
        at the same time. He was much more\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n16\nadvanced in throwing than I was, he had great skills
        as a potter. But we were these foreigners,\nexcept for Judy, so we bonded.
        And Trevor was there, he was a thrower and he did stacking the\nkilns, he\u2019s
        still alive, no longer working there. John Bedding arrived about that same
        time, he\nwas also born in forty-seven, and we all became friends. It\u2019s
        like this family, this dysfunctional\nfamily, this divided, dysfunctional
        family\u2014\nAW: What made it\u2014?\nJO: And that part of it was a shock
        because I came from this large happy family, were you didn\u2019t\nexpress
        any kind of emotions, you just keep them in. But there, there were battles
        and fights.\nAnyway, Bernard died and Janet ran it for another twenty years
        and then she died and it closed.\nIt was closed for a while. And then it was
        in danger of being bulldozed, the buildings on it. So\nJohn Bedding got people
        together and started a trust and raised a couple million dollars and\nhooked
        it up with an art school in the area, and saved it. So now it\u2019s this
        institution where they\nhave built a new studio, they built a new kiln area,
        they built a new museum, they built a new\ngallery, and then they bought the
        house next door, which, they\u2019re teaching children\u2019s classes\nthere
        now. So they just reached out into the community now, which is so neat. John
        is now head\nof the pottery production there. And there couldn\u2019t be a
        better person to do that. So they just\nhired him, so I\u2019ll be able to
        go back and spend some time with him in that building. It\u2019s going to\nbe
        so much fun. I\u2019m going to pay him back for all those tricks he pulled
        on me.\n00:55:45\nAW: (Laughs) What kind of tricks?\nJO: They were always
        teasing me. One trick was we had to wedge up\u2014in the morning\u2014balls
        of\nclay that were maybe two pounds apiece, and there were scales in the back
        there\u2014so I get on the\nwheel, trying to make this bowl that had to be
        exactly, like six and a half inches across, and I just\ncouldn\u2019t, it
        just wouldn\u2019t, there wasn\u2019t enough clay there, I couldn\u2019t get
        it up enough. John and\nTrevor, he was part of it too, they put some extra
        weight underneath the scale, a ball of clay, so\nall my balls weighed the
        wrong amount. Another time, oh, they tied my wheel shut so I couldn\u2019t\nmove
        the crank bar. Another time they put in a ball of clay, they had this dye,
        this powder that\nthey used to powder the glazes. They put some in a little
        ball of clay, so I opened up the kind\nof\u2014and, Oh, there\u2019s red all
        over the place, what is going on here? Stuff like that. Another time,\nI\u2019m
        terrified of snakes and they have a snake there called an adder, which is
        poisonous. So, Alan\ncomes in one day, he was a real joker, \u201cOh my god,
        I got bitten by an adder!\u201d And I thought,\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d And
        so (gasp), \u201cI\u2019ll get the car and take you to the hospital\u201d\u2014and
        \u201cjust kidding!\u201d\nIt\u2019s just stuff like that, they\u2019re always
        teasing me, if they get a rise out of me.\nAW: Did you tease them back? Did
        you have any tricks?\nJO: No, but I did, I talked Johnny into playing strip
        poker with his girlfriend, I won\u2014YES!\n(Laughs)\nAW: (Laughs) There you
        go\u2014that\u2019s a good trick. So, it was Johnny Bedding.\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n17\nJO: John Bedding.\nAW:
        Alan\u2014?\nJO: Alan Brough is no longer alive. And it\u2019s his wife that
        had the colored pink and blue, purple\nhair, which is so cool, she\u2019s
        a seamstress.\nAW: Sheila?\nJO: Sheila Brough, yeah.\nAW: How do you spell
        her last name?\nJO: B-r-o-u-g-h.\nAW: And then who were these other students?
        You said there was an Australian\u2014\nJO: Her name is Judy Gardner and she\u2019s
        no longer making pots, but she lives in town.\nAW: Here in Minnesota?\nJO:
        No, in St. Ives. She didn\u2019t move away, well she specifically lives in
        London and St. Ives,\nthey have a second home there.\nAW: And then there was
        a French\u2014?\nJO: Oh, she left, I replaced her. Chantel.\nAW: And the Japanese
        potter?\nJO: His name was Shigeyoshi. S-h-i-g-e-y-o-s-h-i, last name is I-c-h-i-n-o.
        And he passed away\nlast year. And how he got there was when Janet was young,
        in her twenties, she went to work in\nShigeyoshi\u2019s pottery. And Shigeyoshi\u2019s
        pottery is from this remote mountain village where\nthey\u2019re all potters.
        His pottery had been passed on for seven hundred years and so Shigeyoshi\ninherited
        the pottery, and so that\u2019s where Janet trained back in the fifties. He
        came over to\nEngland, he was twenty-five, and he came over to learn how to
        make more western pots, because\nthe diet in Japan was changing. There\u2019s
        not that need for the rice bowls and sake cups, they were,\ntheir diet was
        becoming more western. So he came over to learn how to make plates and things\nthat
        were more\u2014and pitchers and things, that were more appropriate to their
        changing diet. But\nhe passed away last year, unexpectedly.\nAW: What were
        the requirements for doing the apprenticeship? How did you get the\napprenticeship?
        You said that MacKenzie had put in a good word?\nJO: He wrote a letter of
        recommendation.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n18\nAW:
        Were there other things you had to do to apply for this?\nJO: I showed them
        some slides or photographs. And first I talked to Janet, and I was just so\nfreaked
        out talking to her, and then she\u2019ll, \u201cI\u2019ll take you down to
        visit Bernard.\u201d Because they\nweren\u2019t married yet, they had separate
        kind of lives. So I went down and I met Bernard. And\nJanet said, \u201cJust
        come back in a year, we\u2019ll have a slot in a year\u2019s time.\u201d And
        so, it just worked\nout perfect. Though, when I think of the pots I showed
        though, oh, just crap. So I learned a\ntremendous amount, being there. And
        I just, I grew up there, that\u2019s where I felt I really sort of\ngrew up.
        It\u2019s the first time I had scotch for lunch. I smoked my first joint there.\nWhen
        I was in college pot wasn\u2019t around then, it just wasn\u2019t. It was
        shortly after that, like a\ncouple years later. So when I was in England there
        was a woman from America that came over\nto work just the summer, who was
        unpaid. She was kind of an odd duck, she\u2019s no longer alive,\nHelene.
        But she was just lots of fun. She was so clumsy though, just this walking
        clumsy. One of\nher jobs was to stack the kiln and she\u2019d be breaking
        pots and I thought\u2014I remember once we\nwere at this secretary\u2019s
        house and the secretary had one of Bernard\u2019s drawings above the mantel,\nlike
        this, and Helene had a glass of wine and she was going to walk up to it, and
        I just said\u2014I\njust know what\u2019s going to happen now because there
        was a little bit of ledge by the hearth\u2014I\njust knew it. And sure enough,
        she tripped and it went on the thing.\nBut, the worst was I talked her into\u2014I
        know I shouldn\u2019t have done this\u2014I talked her into renting\na Vespa
        motor scooter, because I had a motorcycle. So we go over to this town and
        we rent hers,\nand we get a little Vespa for her, and she gets a helmet and
        we\u2019re leaving town\u2014we\u2019re going on\nthis back road and I remember
        seeing this, I saw this wall when I was there last\u2014there\u2019s this\nstone
        wall that bends like this in the road. And I thought, \u201cOh, this is not
        going to go\u2014please\ndon\u2019t hit, please don\u2019t hit this wall.\u201d
        So she just went right into it, right into that wall. She wasn\u2019t\nhurt,
        thank God. The bike was all bent up so they needed to come and pick it up.
        She was a really\ngood sport. We became good friends because we were Americans
        and felt misplaced. But when I\nthink of my education there, it was, it came
        through\u2014we\u2019d go to the pub every Saturday night,\nand then we\u2019d
        go back to Alan\u2019s house. And we\u2019re sitting in this big circle, like
        this, and all\nyakking away, and someone lit up a cigarette and he was passing
        this cigarette to the other\nperson. And I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s very
        odd.\u201d\nSo, this thing is being passed\u2014and Helene just whispers to
        me, \u201cdon\u2019t inhale it.\u201d And of course,\nI did, and of course,
        I smoked it every week, you know with all the rest of them. But when I\nthink
        back on those years, the learning\u2014it came through the making of the pots.
        And world-renowned\npotters would come there to visit, so we had that connection
        when other potters came\ndown to visit. It\u2019s just very rich in terms
        of living in this artists\u2019 colony with these great artists\nand kind
        of being on my own for the first time in this foreign country. It was a great
        experience,\nit was very difficult though, trying to fit in there. They\u2019d
        tease about my American accent all the\ntime. But I felt I really kind of
        grew up there.\n01:03:10\nAW: To take a few steps back, in high school you
        mentioned you had your first experience with\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n19\nclay was with your high school art
        teacher?\nJO: Correct.\nAW: All right, tell us about your art teacher and
        that moment, those classes.\nJO: I had two art teachers, I had Teddy Warikois,
        a woman who is no longer alive.\nAW: How do you spell her last name?\nJO:
        W-a-r-i-k-o-i-s\u2014it was Theodora, her nickname was Teddy, so Teddy Warikois.
        And the\nother one was Frank Zeller, who\u2014he\u2019s seventy-five and he
        was one of the founders of the White\nBear Center for the Arts way back when,
        if you know their art center.\nThey\u2019re both just great teachers. When
        he was up here, last year, he said he let me in the room so\nI could make
        pots at night, but I don\u2019t remember that part at all. But I remember
        they were really\ngood teachers. It was his first year of teaching; he was
        a young man then. I\u2019d been taking art\nclasses as\u2014throughout my
        entire life. As a kid\u2014I always loved the making of things and\npainting
        and all that. But I knew when I threw that ball of clay down on that little
        wheel\u2014what it\nwas\u2014a love of this material and also trying to master
        that technique of getting the clay on center\nand pulling up a cylinder. That
        part was challenging, and I tend to gravitate to those sorts of\nthings where
        you have to learn a technique\u2014you have to master it. That part I related
        to\u2014\nThen when I got to Bemidji State and took my first class, my teacher
        there was Westy James, a\nwoman who was actually a grad school student of
        Warren\u2019s in the early sixties.\nAW: How do you spell her first name?\nJO:
        W-e-s-t-y.\nAW: Just \u201cWesty?\u201d\nJO: Um hm. She died maybe thirty
        years ago. Westy was not a good potter. She was a really\ngreat educator,
        and so she was very supportive and I just adored her, she was a great teacher.
        But\nshe only made maybe a dozen pots a year, for the faculty show, because
        she was an educator.\nShe taught art history and materials and pottery, etcetera.\nWhen
        I was there as a freshman, Warren MacKenzie came to do a workshop with John
        Reeve, a\nCanadian potter who\u2019s no longer alive. They did this workshop
        and I was just amazed at the\noutput, they just made hundreds of pots in that
        weekend. I just couldn\u2019t believe all the pots they\nmade. Shortly after
        that a friend and I went down, we were down in the cities, and we went to\nvisit
        Warren in his studio. There were just racks of pots, just hundreds of pots,
        everywhere. And\nthey were working away. I remember I showed Warren\u2014I
        made this big bowl, what a dog\u2014and\nI showed it to him and he didn\u2019t
        say a word about it. Just looked at it and turned it over\u2014it was a\npiece
        of crap (laughs). But that\u2019s when I got the glimpse of what a potter,
        a working potter\u2019s, life\nwas all about, through that. This is what a
        potter does. And that was attractive, that lifestyle was\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n20\nattractive.\nI did get
        a sense of that reading The Potter\u2019s Book and reading The Potter\u2019s
        Book I tend to\nromanticize everything. So I just romanticized what it would
        be like to be there, working. I\nthought you\u2019d maybe make pots for a
        little bit and then you\u2019d have tea on the lawn. Get served\ntea and then
        go take a swim on the beach or something, come back and\u2014I just romanticized\nwhat
        it would be like.\nThe reality of it and\u2014but I knew, I caught on pretty
        quick that it\u2019s\u2014when I came back here it\u2019s\nnot going to be
        a romantic, charming life. A lot of its just donkeywork. And there\u2019s
        still a great\nsatisfaction of working with my hands. But, when the pot comes
        out of the kiln I lose my\nattachment to it. They\u2019re just sold and they
        just go away and that\u2019s fine. They need to do their\njob. So I don\u2019t
        save many of my pieces because I just move on to the next idea.\nWhat I do
        love about it is the freedom to choose my rhythm of work. I work late at night,
        I don\u2019t\nlike mornings at all. I get up at ten, and then I go make coffee,
        and I go back to bed and I call\nJackie at two, and she\u2019s in bed and
        we have coffee together over the phone. And then I grab my\niPad and deal
        with correspondence and stuff like that. And then I get up, and I don\u2019t
        get out there\nsometimes until noon, one, two, three, four, five. Then I work
        until midnight, one or two,\nbecause I like night\u2014I like nighttime. I
        think I have AD\u2014.\nAW: Like ADD or ADHD?\nJO: Yes, I just bounce around
        in the morning. Do a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and just do\nall
        this\u2014and then, it gets dark and I can calm down and I can focus. That\u2019s
        just me. And you\nknow what, I\u2019ve just learned I have to just let it
        run its course. I can\u2019t contain it much, just have\nto live with it.
        I can drive people around me nuts.\nIn the wintertime I can get a lot of work
        done because you can\u2019t be outside, you\u2019re stuck inside.\nSo that
        fits a potter\u2019s life too, because it\u2019s interior activity. And it\u2019s
        really odd to say, I\u2019ve got\nforty-five acres, I think I\u2019ve hiked
        the property, or skied it, maybe twice in forty years. I just\nwalk between
        here and the house and maybe a bit out there. Why am I living out here? Solitude,\nit\u2019s
        having control over the environment and I love to be able to look out and
        hear things. And\nI\u2019m not an outdoorsy hiker, or head to the mountains
        and hike, I\u2019m just not\u2014I\u2019m fat and lazy\n(laughs).\nAW: It
        sounds like you\u2019re quite busy to me.\nJO: I get a lot done, I do, once
        I get going--tsh tsh tsh--I get a lot done.\n01:10:15\nAW: So how did you
        come to get this house? Why did you move out here? When did you move\nout
        here?\nJO: I moved out here in \u201974. When I came back from England I rented
        a house out in the country\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n21\nnear
        River Falls and I was renting a place, it was thirty-five bucks a month. It
        didn\u2019t have any\nrunning water inside and it was an old dumpy farmhouse
        and I cleaned up the barn and made a\nstudio out in the barn. I was part of
        the whole \u201cback-to-the-earth\u201d movement. And that was a\nreally fun
        part of my life. With some friends, we had an old farmhouse that we were fixing
        up\nand we grew our own food and had Volkswagen buses and things (laughs).
        We got Mother\nEarth\u2019s News\u2014if you know that magazine?\nThe Foxfire
        books\u2014the whole \u201cback-to-the-earth\u201d movement was about being
        self-sustaining,\nhow you live and growing your own food, and cutting wood,
        and heating with wood, and kind of\n\u201copting out.\u201d So I just fit
        in with that movement, it just fit. And there\u2019s a lot of mutual support.\nAnd
        part of that whole thing was the making of crafts too. That was dovetailed
        in with the \u201cback-to-\nthe-earth\u201d movement too, so it all just kind
        of fit together. Until the barn burned down\u2014in\n\u201873, I think it
        burned down. I didn\u2019t have insurance because we were part of that whole\nmovement
        so you were \u201canti-insurance,\u201d \u201canti-establishment,\u201d so
        I lost the whole lot.\nI ended up buying this place about a year later. I
        knew I couldn\u2019t be any further than an hour\naway from Minneapolis\/St.
        Paul. I just drew a circle around the Twin Cities and I checked\nsouthwest\u2014I
        love Wisconsin, but I couldn\u2019t find anything there. And I had some realtors
        looking\nand I put ads in papers. But I\u2019d spent time just driving out
        to the country and finding places that\nwere abandoned and checking out the
        owner. I had a card file and was very methodical. It took a\nyear and there
        was an ad in the Sunday paper, said, \u201cHandyman Special: Hobby Farm on
        5\nAcres, bring your hammer.\u201d And it was just a wreck of a house. The
        only things that are original\nare the studs; basically I\u2019ve done all
        the work myself. I leveled floors, gutted it, changed\nwoodwork, done all
        the plumbing and the heating stuff, and that\u2019s what\u2019s taken so long
        because I\nlove a project. And it\u2019s all about a project. Although, owning
        an old house, it\u2019s overwhelming in\nthe amount of\u2014it needs a new
        roof now, but I\u2019m not going to put the roof on anymore, I\u2019m just\ngonna
        hire that out, but the siding hasn\u2019t been stained in twenty years and
        the floor should be\nsanded. I haven\u2019t painted the walls in thirty years
        and I just can\u2019t keep up with it. And so, some\nfriends of mine from
        Australia\u2014what I had here for a number of years is what I\u2019ve called
        a \u201cclay\ncamp.\u201d I would invite potters from my travels that would
        come and work here for two months\nright before the Tour and I invited friends
        here. Once there were Australians, and there were\nEnglish folks, and people
        from New Zealand, people I met in my travels, when I was working\noverseas
        and liked. \u201cCome, work with me.\u201d Then we\u2019d have the Tour and
        they\u2019d make enough\nmoney to finance the whole thing. And that was really
        fun while it lasted. But Sandy was here,\nfrom Australia, and she\u2019s just
        the neatest person. We\u2019re so much alike\u2014she made her house. She\nmade
        five thousand bricks and built her house.\nSandy\u2014so they made a list,
        they went around their property and they made a list\u2014they live out\nin
        the country too, and built their buildings\u2014they just made a list of things
        not to do, but things\nto leave, to not do in their lifetime to free up money
        and time, that they could just let go. And I\njust love that, so I\u2019m
        kind of doing that too. The only things I want to keep up are my car and the\npianos
        and the next owner can repair stuff because I\u2019d rather do other things
        than that. One thing\nthat\u2019s happened\u2014when your parents die your
        whole world changes, and what you think is\nimportant just changes, and it\u2019s
        a big lesson. Because I went in there two or three times a week\u2014\nI\u2019d
        drive to White Bear two or three times a week, to see my folks. And they ended
        up both in\nthe same room. They put the bed together, the last six months
        they were able to be there. I\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n22\nrealized
        that I was missing out on a lot by being this little workaholic. I would isolate
        a lot and\nget a lot of work done. Now: Oh I\u2019ll do that later, and I\u2019ll
        go play with some friends. So that was\na lesson that was long in coming about
        what\u2019s really important. It\u2019s about being with friends\nrather than
        making another run of cups or something.\n01:15:45\nAW: So relationships have
        been really important to you.\nJO: Yes.\nAW: Sounds like they always have\u2014maybe
        more so now when you\u2019re making time for them.\nJO: Right, yep\u2014 And,
        I went fishing a couple weekends ago. Can you believe that?\nAW: (Laughs)
        I don\u2019t know, are you an avid fisherman?\nJO: Not at all\u2014no, hate
        it, no\u2014but I go to be with friends. We go up to Lake of the Woods, and\nthey
        have a cabin. And I can put the minnow on my\u2014do you know how to fish?\nAW:
        Just a bit, not well.\nJO: Do you know how to fish?\nTM: A little bit.\nJO:
        So I can put them\u2014I didn\u2019t for a couple years put the minnow on,
        Deb would do that\nbecause \u201cEww, creepy.\u201d I put the minnow on though,
        I just grab it and do what you do, and I put\nthat thing down\u2014but I don\u2019t,
        when I reel in the fish I don\u2019t touch them. John or Deb, they do\nthat.
        I say, \u201cOh I got one here!\u201d And then they\u2019d touch it and they\u2019d
        do\u2014you know, because I\u2019ve\nnever touched one.\nAW: Do you keep them
        and eat them?\nJO: We keep them. I\u2019m not one to brag: two weeks ago I
        caught a twenty-four and a half inch\nwalleye. It had to go back because it
        was over the limit. And then sadly, I had to go catch a\nbunch of fourteen
        inchers. If it\u2019s under twelve you have to throw it back. So, there\u2019s
        that range\nand I caught half a dozen fish. John does all the flaying. I don\u2019t
        know how to do that and I don\u2019t\ncare to do that.\nAW: Yeah, that\u2019s
        a tough job too (laughs).\nJO: Yeah, right, that\u2019s an art. But you do
        it. And then I went ice fishing a number of times. And\nice fishing gives
        you bragging rights. It just makes for a great story when you\u2019re in a
        different\nstate or out of the country. \u201cYou\u2019re doing what?! When
        it\u2019s twenty below?!\u201d And it\u2019s\u2014have you\never ice fished?
        I go with Deb and then her husband and Jackie. The last time I went it was\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n23\ntwenty-some
        below. I just couldn\u2019t wait until they had to go pee outside. I just
        really teased them\na lot. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s brutal, it\u2019s just
        brutal. Why do you do that? It\u2019s just so, the whole thing of it,\nand
        this little box way out when it\u2019s twenty below looking down this hole
        (laughs). You step\nback and look at it and, but it\u2019s just\u2014why not?\nAW:
        It\u2019s a way of enjoying being outside, I guess.\nJO: Well, we had a heated
        house that we rented. Oh I\u2019m not going to be standing outside, Ooo,\nno
        way. But, I just figure, why not? And on my bucket list is\u2014I\u2019m going
        to go skydiving. I was\ngoing to do that on my sixtieth but there\u2019s one
        in Baldwin, that\u2019s not very far from here, so I was\nresearching it and
        that day someone\u2019s chute didn\u2019t open. This guy had four thousand
        jumps and\njust, there was this accident. So then I started YouTubing, you
        can YouTube and see accidents\nfor people that skydive. Have you ever done
        that? So that really turned me off. I thought, Oh, I\u2019m\nnot gonna do
        that. But I\u2019m warming up to it again.\nWhen dad died, it was on my ten-year
        anniversary, I thought I have to turn this day into one of\njoy. So I bought
        eight tickets for my friends to go up in a hot air balloon, but they had to
        cancel\nbecause of the weather. And then I couldn\u2019t get them\u2014so
        I sold somebody the tickets and I went\nup on my own\u2014well, with a group
        of people I did. We went over my lake where I grew up and\nI\u2019ve got one
        more ticket, and I\u2019m going to do it\u2014maybe I\u2019ll do it on the
        twenty-first, on dad\u2019s,\nthe anniversary of his death, yeah that\u2019s
        what I\u2019ll do.\n01:20:10\nAW: Wow, that\u2019s great. So what did your
        dad do?\nJO: My dad manufactured water softeners. His business partner was
        Bill Steger whose son Will\nwent to the North Pole. Will and I worked on occasion
        at dad\u2019s factory so I knew him when I\nwas a kid. I haven\u2019t seen
        him for many, many years. I did write to him because dad told me\nbefore he
        died that Will came to the office and wanted money from his father and my
        dad. My\ndad says, \u201cI\u2019ll give you money if you promise to pee my
        name on the North Pole.\u201d That\u2019s so\nDad. So I wrote to Will a while
        ago to see if that was true, but he didn\u2019t write back.\nSo, my dad loved
        making money. He was successful in business; he made a ton of money in his\nlife,
        just made a ton. But he was very generous; he gave a lot of money away. He
        sold his first\nbusiness\u2014he was forty-nine and took all us kids around
        the world, a trip. This is 1966, and we\nleft Seattle and went to Hong Kong,
        and then Tokyo and Kyoto and Thailand and Lebanon and\nthrough Europe, and
        then England. And then what they do is they\u2019d go back to favorite spots.
        So\nthey traveled every year. They did a lot of traveling. And dad just spent
        his fortune on that.\nWell, when he died there was hardly a penny, he blew
        it all, just blew it all and had good times.\nSo dad, \u201cI don\u2019t care,
        you educated us, we had a lot of fun, just don\u2019t worry about the inheritance\nthing
        at all.\u201d I think you know, once your parents go, is that you realize
        how from each of them\nyou get this part of them. And my dad, I got his, like
        I haven\u2019t saved a nickel for retirement or\u2014I\njust don\u2019t save
        it. It just goes to this place. This place is where the money just gets gobbled
        up.\nBetween this, or piano lessons or something\u2014it just does, but I
        know I can just make some more\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n24\nof it.\nMy dad and my mom gave me this sense of
        adventure and curiosity, which are key components\nof being a creative person.
        And they were very curious. Mom was a very curious woman, very\nwell educated,
        very smart. She read every night until two in the morning, she was just this\nvoracious
        reader. One thing that mom did is that when she started having her kids, is
        that she\ndidn\u2019t let the kids get in the way of her life, being out there,
        active. She would see her sorority\nsisters, and League of Women Voters, and
        AFS thing\u2014she was always out there doing stuff.\nShe\u2019d get all gussied
        up and just take off. We had a live in maid for many years that kind of\nraised
        us and would do the laundry and stuff like that. And then we got older and
        mom, \u201cNo, you\ncan manage without the maid.\u201d And so, \u201cYou\u2019re
        on your own, kids.\u201d She didn\u2019t let us get in the\nway of her growth.
        Which, that\u2019s really a modern thing now, then in the forties, that was
        a\ndifferent deal back then. And I just remember, and to this day if I see
        a chicken pot\u2014a\nSwanson\u2019s chicken potpie\u2014I always think of
        abandonment. Because mom and dad would get all\ngussied up to go somewhere
        and mom would throw in a bunch of those chicken pot pies for us\nsix kids\u2014just
        throw them in the oven, \u201cJust take them out in a half hour, we\u2019re
        outta here.\u201d And\none thing I always remember with mom\u2014looking back,
        before she left, to see if the seams were\nstraight on her nylons. (Whispers)
        Did you know the nylons used to have the seam in the back?\nAW: Um hm.\nJO:
        It\u2019s true\u2014and so I always think of\u2014when I think of chicken
        pot pies I always think of\nabandonment and I think of mom checking on the
        back of her legs (laughs).\nSo the two of them just gave me these ingredients
        to be who I am now\u2014to have this sense of\nadventure. I can do this and
        be serious in the studio. Yet my dad was a fun, adventuresome\u2014\nhe\u2019d
        say, \u201cOkay kids, pack your suitcases, we\u2019re going to Mexico now.\u201d
        And this was over\nChristmas break. And we\u2019d say, \u201cOkay dad.\u201d
        And we\u2019d haul off and just had a lot of fun\ntraveling as a family, just
        lots of fun. That was his gift to us, this adventure thing. So I\u2019m\u2014and\nas
        you get older I realize that I have\u2014I\u2019m turning into my parents
        (laughs).\n01:25:20\nAW: Yeah, so are you traveling more now?\nJO: Just when
        I said that\u2014I\u2019m really kind of tired of traveling. Though I\u2019m
        going off next week\nto teach in North Carolina and then going back to England
        in September, and I have other\nworkshops out of the state throughout the
        year. One thing I\u2019m aware of too: that a potter\u2019s life is\nnot just
        to sit and work in isolation for long periods. You need to be out there in
        the world. And\nso that\u2019s where my ideas come from, they come from getting
        out in the world. I can look at a\npiece and say, \u201cOkay, I got that ribbing
        from my trip to Australia,\u201d for instance, \u201cand this one\ncame from
        New Zealand.\u201d My whole love of Art Deco in the work\u2014that hard-edged
        stuff came\nfrom walking this town in New Zealand. It\u2019s all Art Deco
        architecture from the late twenties. So,\nI gather, when I go out there, I
        gather\u2014it\u2019s like fishing\u2014I gather out there. Then I come back\nand
        I refine it in my studio and I refine it and get the idea going. And that\u2019s
        my source; the world\nis my source. When I was training as a potter, we just
        looked at historical pots, or we looked in\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n25\nthe magazines. We weren\u2019t encouraged to look
        into other areas of art, or to other experiences, or\nto other stuff. I lived
        with that for years and years and years until I hit Napier, this village in
        New\nZealand. I walked into this village and I thought, This is what I\u2019ve
        been after, this is it.\nGeometry, I\u2019ve always loved geometry. Susan
        walked in one day and said, \u201cThat bracelet\u2014\u201d\nwhich came from
        Taos, New Mexico\u2014she said, \u201cOf course you\u2019d love that as a
        kid, that\u2019s Art\nDeco.\u201d I said, \u201cIt never occurred to me, it
        never occurred to me.\u201d So I go back and look at\nphotographs of me as
        a kid and what I had in my room, in my bedroom. It was all geometric\nstuff.
        I\u2019ve responded to that. But my training as a potter came through looking
        at the history of\nceramics.\nSo when I found this village and I was, you
        know, in my fifties, I thought, I\u2019m home, this is what\nI want in my
        work. And I realized that when I was in college I took a lot of design classes
        from\nKeith Malmquist, who was just an amazing design teacher. He was in his
        thirties. I took a lot of\ndesign, I love design. But we were not encouraged
        to, when we were making pots, to bring in,\nsay what we\u2019re learning in
        sculpture or painting\u2014it just was a different source. I realized three\nyears
        ago that, Oh Keith, thank you. I have to find him. I found him, he was still
        alive, in\nnorthern Minnesota. I called him up and said, \u201cKeith, this
        is Jeff Oestreich.\u201d He said, \u201cI\nremember you.\u201d I said, \u201cKeith,
        you were such a great teacher, I had such a crush on you.\u201d\nBut he just
        died and he\u2019s buried in Scandia\u2014about twenty minutes from here\u2014because
        he has a\nbrother in the cemetery. But I said, \u201cKeith, tell me about
        your background. Where did you study\nart?\u201d So, \u201cI taught high school
        art at Bemidji and then I went back to school, I went to Yale.\u201d\nAnd
        that was a long time ago\u2014he studied with Joseph Albers from the Bauhaus.
        If you know\nJoseph and Anni Albers? They were fundamental in the whole design\/painting
        world, way back\nwhen they taught at the Bauhaus in Germany. When Hitler got
        in power he closed that down so\nthey all left the country, all the greats.
        Joseph and Anni moved to America, Lucie Rie moved to\nLondon, they just got
        out of the country. These great people\u2014and they closed down the\nBauhaus.
        So Keith studied with one of the world\u2019s greats, so that just all made
        sense, like, \u201cAw,\nwhat a gift.\u201d But I wanted to thank him, I said,
        \u201cThank you Keith.\u201d\n01:29:30\nAW: So did you meet up with him? Or
        just talk to him over the phone?\nJO: I was going up north and I called him
        and he wasn\u2019t home. And then someone said that he\nhad Alzheimer\u2019s
        and then they moved him down here to Hudson and then he passed away. I\nhaven\u2019t
        been to his grave yet, but I go to Scandia a lot. I\u2019m going to stop at
        the cemetery. Again,\nit\u2019s having these key people at the right time
        that open the door, and he\u2019s on that short list of\npeople, he was just
        so inspiring. He just loved design, he was really a good designer. He loved\nteaching
        it. I remember acing those classes, I just ate it up.\nAW: What was his last
        name?\nJO: Malmquist\u2014it\u2019s a Swedish name, isn\u2019t it?\nBut, when
        I think of the teachers in my life, they all gave me something a bit different.
        Be it\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n26\neither
        pure education or role modeling or whatever it might be. I feel just blessed
        with these\npeople that came into my life. From my Aunt Judy, just all across
        the board here\u2014and my dad\ngave me the confidence to be able to make
        money, I mean to not worry about it because he\nwasn\u2019t a saver, if he
        had it he\u2019d just blow it\u2014go make some more. So I live on faith\u2014and
        I\u2019ll\nhave to work until I\u2019m dead, but that\u2019s okay (laughs).\nAW:
        Well speaking of working and making money\u2014you left England and then you
        said you\nmoved to Wisconsin. Did you get a business going right away? How
        did that all happen? Take us\nback to those first years\u2014\nJO: Well, I
        came back in June of \u201871 and I came back to my parents because I had
        my studio still\nthere, that my dad built me and this kiln. And so, the plan
        was to work a bit and save money then\nbuy a place. So I started making pots
        right off the bat. When I came back Randy Johnston\nwanted to work with me.
        So I said, \u201cSure, you can come work with me.\u201d So we worked in this\nlittle
        studio. So we said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a sale out here.\u201d So we asked
        Warren MacKenzie if we\ncould borrow his mailing list\u2014how ballsy is that?!
        He said, \u201cSure.\u201d And so we had this sale in\nmy parents\u2019 backyard,
        and people came to see it\u2014we sold about six or seven hundred dollars\nworth
        of pots. I thought, Wow, we have it made. Well, that didn\u2019t last long.
        But it was this\u2014\nsaving up money and I could not find a farm to buy.
        So the one in Wisconsin, where the pottery\nburned down, the guy said, \u201cWell,
        you can buy the house on five or ten acres for ten thousand.\u201d I\nthought
        that was too much though\u2014and so, I moved back to my parents\u2019 and
        the plan was that\u2014\nI was just kind of heartbroken I lost the studio\u2014but
        they had a benefits sale and we bought\nanother wheel, and buy materials,
        etcetera. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to Japan and work with\nHamada.\u201d
        I\u2019m going to go work with the other \u201cgreat.\u201d Why not? What
        the hell? I remember I\nwrote Hamada, didn\u2019t get a letter back, didn\u2019t
        get it back. So I wrote my friend Shigeyoshi from\nTamba. I had maybe three
        thousand dollars saved and he didn\u2019t write back, didn\u2019t write back,
        so\nI just said to myself, \u201cIf I don\u2019t hear from him by September
        1st I\u2019m going to take this three\nthousand and I\u2019m going to use
        it on a down-payment on a farm.\u201d So anyway, the first rolled\naround
        and he didn\u2019t write, and I fell in love with my first love, Jerry. So
        I thought, \u201cCrap, this is\na mess.\u201d So I thought, Well, it\u2019s
        after the first, I think it\u2019s the second. So I bought this place, and\nthen
        he came up, and helped clean up this mess, and helped paint the walls. So
        I\u2019ve been here for\nforty years next month.\nAW: Did you ever hear from
        Shigeyoshi?\nJO: Yeah, I did. The second or third of September, and I thought,
        Well, crap. I said, \u201cBy the\nfirst,\u201d and I meant it. And then I
        fell in love with Jerry so I\u2019m not going to go over there. And it\u2019s\na
        good thing I didn\u2019t do that because John Bedding had some tough experiences
        there. Because\nhe went to work with this traditional pottery place and it
        was just hard work.\nSo, I bought this place and it was cheap: seventeen thousand,
        five hundred on five acres, I\u2019ve\nsince bought another forty acres but\u2014I
        love this area. I didn\u2019t know that it was close to St. Croix\nFalls.
        When I moved up here it was really a very tight Swedish community, a hundred
        and\ntwenty Swedes. And here\u2019s me, moving up here, a German and a potter,
        that was weird to them.\nAnd a gay guy, they didn\u2019t know what to do with
        any of that. So I was an oddity. I got to know\nthe first house coming in.
        It was an old, old retired farm couple who were in their eighties, they\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n27\nkind of
        took me in and\u2014Dudley and Sylvia Baruch. They were just lovely people.
        He just\nalways had blue shirts all starched and the top button\u2014and she
        had this flower dress on\u2014they\nwere just so sweet. They were lovely,
        lovely people. I was down there for dinner once and I just\nsaid to Sylvia,
        I said, \u201cGosh Sylvia, I\u2019ve been here for like five or ten years
        and I\u2019m just an\noutsider.\u201d So, \u201cI\u2019m an outsider too.\u201d
        I said, \u201cWhere\u2019d you grow up?\u201d She said, \u201cI grew in\nPalmdale,
        that\u2019s five miles that way.\u201d Exactly five miles on the way to TF
        [Taylor\u2019s Falls]. All\nher life, for like sixty years, she still thought
        of herself as being an outsider. I mean, that\u2019s how\ntight this community
        was with Swedes.\nSo, some time went by and Jim Cordes wrote a book about
        Amador Township, our township.\nAnd this is when I began to realize I\u2019m
        accepted here now, is that the book came out and in the\nvery back it had
        a listing of all the things that happened year by year. Like in 1904 they
        built the\nchurch, 1910 it burned down\u2014in 1974 it said, \u201cOestreich
        Pottery started.\u201d I thought, What? This\nis amazing. I think they were
        just hard up for news for that year, but I just felt validated then.\nAnd
        then I came home fifteen years ago and I saw this sign, \u201cPottery Trail.\u201d
        \u201cOh ick!\u201d You see,\nwhat happened\u2014I was always Route 1 Box
        104, how quaint. But what happened was that they\nhad to name all the unnamed
        gravel roads because they\u2019re hooking up to the GPS system then.\nSo,
        a committee met in Almelund, a little tiny little town hall, and they had
        to go down the\nalphabet, for these unnamed roads. \u201cThat one is \u2018o,\u2019
        it\u2019s Oriole.\u201d This road had to begin with a\n\u201cP.\u201d So someone
        said, this is second-hand, \u201cOh, there\u2019s that potter living down
        there, let\u2019s call it\nPottery Trail.\u201d And the next one over was
        \u201cQ.\u201d And I said that, \u201cIf this road had to begin with a\n\u2018Q\u2019
        they\u2019d call it \u2018Queer Trail\u2019 or \u2018Queen Trail\u2019\u201d
        (laughs). So, that\u2019s a big joke.\nBut, you know, all those old Swedes
        have died, they\u2019re gone, it\u2019s all changed now. But when I\nmoved
        up here, it was like moving up to\u2014where in the hell is this little farm
        on the prairie? I\nwas the first potter that moved out here. Then two years
        later Janel [Jacobson] moved out, so we\nbecame friends right off the bat.
        And then Linda [Christianson] moved out, we became friends,\nand then she
        worked here for a year. And then Bob [Briscoe] moved\u2014well Connie [Mayeron]\nmoved
        out, Bob moved out, Rick [Vincent] moved out, Guillermo [Cuellar] moved out.
        So we\ncreated this cluster here of\u2014but it\u2019s odd how people assume
        that we\u2019re all buddies, we hang out\ntogether. We see each other just
        at the meetings twice a year. At one point we were, way back\nwhen, we did
        spend a lot of time together, but people started having their kids and whatever.
        And\nlife would be just changing, and so that part\u2019s changed. But, in
        spirit we\u2019re a community here.\n01:38:10\nJO: So tell me\u2014I\u2019ve
        never been in Rick\u2019s. You were at Rick\u2019s house today right? I\u2019ve
        never\neven been in his house.\nI dropped something off and left it on the
        step once\u2014about ten years ago. And yet we do feel\nthis collective, we
        just feel something in that\u2014 I know that\u2019s odd but\u2014I\u2019ve
        been in Bob\u2019s house\nonce, Linda\u2019s house I\u2019ve been in a lot,
        Janel\u2019s a lot, way back, you know thirty years ago. But,\nit\u2019s just
        the meetings but we still\u2014we\u2019re known, this tour is known around
        the country. We\u2019re\nthe number one tour now. We\u2019ve gotten so much
        exposure and so much\u2014it\u2019s grown into this\nphenomena\u2014it\u2019s
        so bizarre.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n28\nAW:
        What\u2019s bizarre about it?\nJO: The response. People come from around the
        world now, people fly in. And I think, Really?!\nAnd now people beg, \u201cCan
        we be a part of the Tour?\u201d And we have to\u2014we can\u2019t\u2014but
        everyone\nthat I have as a guest here\u2014I had a guest here who is a Director
        of the Archie Bray this year and\nhe said, \u201cThese people here are so
        educated.\u201d The people that come take the Tour they\u2019re really\nknowledgeable
        about pots, and that\u2019s unique. And they keep coming back and you think
        that\u2014\nwe\u2019re always worried that\u2014 Okay, let\u2019s keep some
        figures here, to see how much we bring in, to\nsee if it\u2019s going downhill
        we have to think of different advertisement. I think this year we\nprobably
        made, all told, maybe half a million. We were up to four-fifty [four hundred
        and fifty\nthousand] last year, but now I think it\u2019s probably gone up
        because it goes up fifty thousand a\nyear. Isn\u2019t that just\u2014? In
        Minnesota, thanks to Warren, his golden years from the sixties, when I\nwas
        there [at the University of Minnesota]\u2014Randy Johnston went through, Michael
        Simon,\nSandy Simon, this group of high energy people that went through the
        program there then settled\nin this area and then just kind of got things
        going. And the [Northern] Clay Center started twenty\nyears ago, we got this
        going, and so, now we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re known.\nI call this the \u201cMashiko
        of America.\u201d Mashiko is a very famous village in Japan that\u2019s all
        potters;\nit\u2019s a couple hours from Tokyo. There\u2019s maybe a hundred
        potters in this village it\u2019s all potters,\nit\u2019s renowned. I call
        this the \u201cMashiko of America\u201d because there\u2019s this density
        of potters in\nMinnesota now and in Wisconsin. I have some theories of why
        this has all happened. I think one\nof them is the kind of pots that are made
        here, the type of pots, they\u2019re not the type of pots that fit\ninto a
        home in, say California or New Mexico. They\u2019re pots that speak of rich
        wood interiors,\nlike this house. They\u2019re just pots that just seem to
        fit in our interiors. So we spend a lot of time\non the interiors, we pay
        a lot of attention to the inside of our houses. They just add the warmth to\nthis
        space. I think that\u2019s a part of it. And we\u2019re Germans, and we\u2019re
        Swedes, and they\u2019re just\u2014\nthey\u2019re makers. So we\u2019ve got
        appreciation built in right there. We also have good public support,\nwe have
        good grants. There''s just an awareness of the arts in Minnesota. So we\u2019ve
        got those\nthings going for us. Yeah, it\u2019s so strange\u2014that phenomena\u2014\nOne
        thing\u2014just to add this\u2014when I started making pots at Bemidji State,
        there was maybe one\npot in ten thousand households, really. And now there\u2019s
        a handmade pot in everyone\u2019s\nhousehold. Either their kid made it at
        a camp, or they made it in high school, they got it as a\nwedding present,
        or their kid took a class, there\u2019s references on TV, \u201cOh, I\u2019m
        going to take my\npottery class.\u201d Oprah was on a wheel last year, I saw
        her on a potter\u2019s wheel. And Martha\nStewart has her Jonathan Adler guy.
        So it\u2019s just this common language now\u2014pottery. And\nwe\u2019ve all
        seen a pot being made on a wheel. But back in the sixties it was so bizarre.
        And\nWarren, he had to educate way back when, in the fifties\u2014he would
        talk a department store into\nletting him put his wheel in the show window
        of the department\u2014people would walk by on the\nsidewalk, \u201cWhat is
        that guy doing?!\u201d There are high school programs now that are far superior\nthan
        the ones I had in college, and they\u2019re just amazing.\nAW: So, when did
        you graduate high school again?\nJO: Nineteen sixty-five.\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n29\nAW: Then you graduated
        from Bemidji in\u2014?\nJO: Nineteen sixty-nine.\nAW: And you went to White
        Bear Lake High School?\nJO: Correct. And that was great, they had a really
        good art program there. Good theater program.\nBut Bemidji\u2014this is just
        heartbreaking\u2014they have canned their whole theater program. They\u2019re\ndown
        to two on the art faculty. They\u2019re going to can that program. It\u2019s
        turning into more of a\ntechnical college. And how these instructors work
        so hard to build it up to what it was\u2014ugh,\nthat\u2019s distressing.\nAW:
        When you were in high school\u2014or at Bemidji too\u2014did you have many
        friends or\ncolleagues who were interested in pottery, who were going to pursue
        it? You were saying it was\nan unusual thing to do.\nJO: A couple, sure.\nAW:
        \u2014but there seem to be some good teachers there so were there other students
        then?\nJO: Right, there was another potter who left, and he made pots for
        a number of years, and then he\nmoved into real estate\u2014no, to insurance.
        We\u2019ve reconnected now. He\u2019s trying to sell his Leach\nwheel and
        some kiln shelves. He\u2019s moving down south to Phoenix.\nAW: Anybody else
        from those times that you still are in contact with? Or was it mainly the\nteachers
        that you--?\nJO: The teachers\u2014a fellow student married my sister. That\u2019s
        about it from that era. It seems a\nlong time ago and the University [of Minnesota],
        I\u2019ve kept in touch with some students there.\nRandy Johnston, we grew
        up on White Bear Lake, so I\u2019ve always known him, and Mark Pharis, I\nsee
        once a year; Wayne Branum, I see once a year. I see Warren and Nancy. Sandy
        Simon,\nMichael Simon, I see on occasion.\n01:45:25\nAW: When did you first
        meet Warren?\nJO: When he came up to Bemidji for the workshop in 1965, that
        first semester. Actually it was a\nquarter system, he came up with John Reeve.
        And I was working for the art department. At that\ntime we bought clay already
        premade in a box at the bookstore. And also, our glazes for the\nclass, we
        mix them up from powder. We bought premixed glazes from the clay company,
        and we\njust added water to the glazes and stirred it up\u2014they had like
        five glazes. So Warren came up\nthere, and John, and I just remember their
        tables were just full of pots. They were just so fast\u2014I\nwas just like
        mesmerized. John Reeve just spent the whole time just making pitchers, and
        they\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n30\nwere
        just lively and spirited and he put the handles upside down. I thought, \u201cHow
        can I do that?\u201d\nSo we\u2019d run over to the bookstore and get some
        more clay. They used up all the clay in the\nbookstore\u2014they just ripped
        through it. And that\u2019s when I thought, \u201cWow.\u201d I was even more
        in\nlove.\nAnd then at the University of Minnesota, when I transferred, I
        remember going over to Warren\u2019s\nhouse for a gathering. Into his house\u2014and
        this house is just full of pots and beautiful furniture\u2014\nand I was just
        kind of taken by it. It was the first kind of potter\u2019s house I\u2019d
        been in to. Thinking,\nWow, this is real amazing. I just remember that. And
        he\u2019s speaking at the White Bear Arts\nCenter, and I\u2019ve been asked
        to come and speak a little bit about Warren, and was just thinking\nwhat to
        talk about. I\u2019ll talk about that first time walking into his house, the
        impression it left on\nme. He had maple floors and there was one board that
        was warped like this and there was a bolt\nholding it down there. I remember
        that hump on the floor for years! And the Swedish blue paint\nbehind the sink,
        and all this. And of course I had that color too when I bought my first house.\nThat
        left such an impression, the warmth of that house, and the beautiful pie safes,
        and dry sinks.\nI just remember the furniture\u2014I was in awe of how rich
        it was\u2014and his studio\u2014and that\naffected me. And the amount of pots
        that he makes when he\u2019s making, he\u2019s just\u2014puts us all to\nshame,
        he just makes hundreds and hundreds. And his kiln is huge, he used to fire
        it once a\nmonth. Last year he said, \u201cOh I\u2019ve slowed down, I only
        fire it now every six weeks.\u201d And I\nthink, (gasp) What? And he gets
        down there and he doesn\u2019t tidy up or anything he just gets right\nto
        it. I just fiddle around, I do this, and then I kind of have to ease into
        it. It takes hours, then I\u2019m\ninto gear. But he just gets down, and he\u2019s
        just so disciplined. He\u2019s got a making list. But the\nsecret of it is
        that Nancy, she does the shopping, the cleaning, a lot of the cooking. I remember\nonce
        when he had to have shoulder surgery and Nancy said, \u201cyou just drive
        me nuts.\u201d He\u2019d be\nleaning over, she\u2019s making bread\u2014so
        she couldn\u2019t wait for him to get back to work because\nwhen he gets to
        work he\u2019s really the happiest. So she provides a stage for him to keep
        working\u2014\nthat\u2019s when he\u2019s happiest.\nAW: Yeah, that seems
        to be the case with the partnerships here\u2014one person helps behind the\nscenes.\nJO:
        I\u2019m so envious.\nAW: You are?\nJO: I could get on my little pity thing,
        Oh, I have to do the cooking, cleaning, and I have to cut\nthe grass, and
        repair the house, and then have to make the work, and a living\u2014I\u2019m
        the only one\nof them that\u2019s single\u2014and then I get over it. Honestly
        I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m in the nursing home\n(laughs).\nI say that
        I\u2019m overwhelmed with house repairs, so I say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait
        \u2018til I\u2019m in the nursing\nhome, so I won\u2019t have to think about
        another project. I won\u2019t have to think about a new pot\nshape.\u201d
        One thing that I need to do is\u2014I feel compelled to come up with new ideas,
        more ideas.\nThat takes a lot of work, and it\u2019s exhausting. By the end
        of the day I\u2019m just wiped out. I don\u2019t\nknow where that came from
        because it wasn\u2019t taught. You weren\u2019t told that you have to come
        up\nwith new things. We were doing production-ware in England. So, it\u2019s
        just this inner need to\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n31\nprovide
        that for the people, to challenge myself. So I often say, \u201cI can\u2019t
        wait to get into that\nnursing home. Then I won\u2019t have to think of another
        pottery glaze or shape.\u201d (Laughs)\n01:50:45\nAW: So, is Warren still
        actively producing then?\nJO: Um hmm.\nAW: I thought he had kind of retired
        in a way, but he\u2019s still very active?\nJO: Yeah, he\u2019s remarkable.\nAW:
        So, where do you get your ideas? What are your inspirations for the pots that
        you make?\nJO: It\u2019s all over the map now, it\u2019s not so much history.
        In fact when I go to a museum I hardly\never go look at the pots, I go look
        at other things. But I\u2019ve got a massive library of pottery books\nand
        I hardly ever open them up. What I get ideas from is often the pot before
        or just looking,\nbeing observant. And, for instance, Art Deco is a major
        thing, but then when I was glazing and\ndecorating last month, I took\u2014well,
        I had some shoe polish out in the studio and I love the cap\nof it, this beautiful
        shape, so I use that as a pattern. I cut around it and made stencils. And
        I\nthought, \u201cHmm. And a deodorant top has this wonderful oval, so I took
        that out there and was\nusing that as a shape to kind of press in. So, ideas
        come from just anywhere. It\u2019s a rich world out\nthere. And then I\u2019ve
        been doing pots that have\u2014do you remember the scales? (Laughs) Like G\nsharp\u2014I\u2019d
        do a G sharp, I made the sharp thing [#] and on the back it says like two
        sharps, the\nscale of G has two sharps right? Yeah.\nAnd then I worked on
        a series called, \u201cWhat Cup Size Are You?\u201d because Jackie and I\u2014she\ncalled
        me up one day and said, \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to go camping with my
        daughter and her\nhusband.\u201d And I said, \u201cJackie, you know we don\u2019t
        camp.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s why I have a hotel for us\ndown the road.\u201d
        (Laughs) We couldn\u2019t get the damn fire going so, \u201cJackie, let\u2019s
        go to the hotel.\u201d\nSo, we got to go to the hotel and we were freezing
        so we went to the hot tub. And we were\nsharing the same room and she said,
        \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d so she left her bra on the bed.\nAnd
        so, I like to play little pranks on people. So I took two of the hotel cups
        and I put them\nunderneath the bra, and she came out and said, \u201cwhat
        are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cI want to find out\nwhat cup size you were.\u201d
        So, I did this whole series of cups that go, \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d
        \u201cC,\u201d \u201cD\u201d around\nit. So that was the inspiration for that.\nTM:
        That\u2019s clever (laughs).\nAW: Yeah (laughs).\nJO: I know it\u2019s kind
        of corny, it\u2019s corny, but I was taught in this very rigid dogmatic school
        of\nthought\u2014and it\u2019s just recent that, I\u2019m sick of this, I
        want to have fun with the work so I did it\u2014\nI\u2019m nuts about Downton
        Abbey. Have you watched it?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n32\nAW:
        Yeah.\nJO: (Sigh) Oh, I have Downton Abbey books. I\u2019ve had Downton Abbey
        dinner parties. I\u2019ve\nwatched each one four times. I know all the characters.
        I\u2019m just crazy about that show. So I have\na series now called, \u201cDownton
        Abbey Quiz Cups.\u201d In the front I put a \u201cD\u201d and \u201cA\u201d
        for Downton\nAbbey, then in back of it I put initials, of one of the thirty-three
        characters, and then like \u201cVC\u201d\nfor instance, \u201cViolet Crawley.\u201d
        And then in the bottom I put a number, and if you can\u2019t guess it\nthen
        you call me up and I\u2019ll charge you five dollars to give you the answer
        (laughs).\nI\u2019m just having fun with this stuff now, just having some
        fun. And that happened\u2014Clary Illian,\nwho is also Leach trained, in Iowa\u2014her
        work has changed, and she\u2019s decorating with faces on\nher pots. That
        kind of fun stuff and she said in this video that, \u201cI just want to have
        fun with the\nwork now.\u201d And I called up Clary and, \u201cClary, I know
        what you mean, this whole Leach thing,\nit\u2019s just dogmatic\u2014oh my
        god\u2014I want to have fun too.\u201d So I just began to lighten up and do\nsome
        corny stuff that\u2014Leach would probably roll over in his grave if he saw
        it, but it\u2019s just\nabout time. Just to lighten up a bit.\n01:54:55\nAW:
        When you first started your business or when you first started making pots
        as a career, were\nyou just following what you had learned?\nJO: Interesting,
        haven\u2019t talked about this yet. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to
        make a living.\nMy dad, I remember my dad was trained in business, he showed
        me how to do a balance sheet\nwith the columns\u2014you know, entry, double
        entry, that thing.\nWell, I tried Quicken for a while, I gave up and went
        back to my old thirteen columns across and\nthen you write in like \u201cTo
        Walmart,\u201d and then you go to the column and you put that income\nexpense,
        and write what the expense was about, if it\u2019s postage, or shipping, or
        clay materials, or\nheating, whatever you put\u2014and anyway, he showed me
        how to do that. He showed me how to\nbalance a checkbook because I didn\u2019t
        write in a checkbook until I was twenty-three, I didn\u2019t\nbalance a checkbook.
        So business stuff, he kind of coached me along. Then he called me up and\nsaid,
        \u201cI\u2019ve got a good idea, you can make some of these Lazy Susans.\u201d
        And I said, \u201cDad, shut\nup, let me make what I want to make.\u201d He
        was just buggin\u2019 me with ideas. So he got me in that\nkind of business.
        Also, when I came back from England, I asked my dad\u2014my dad would loan\nout
        money to his children right and left, \u2018til about the day he died. But
        I never went to my dad for\nmoney because I was really independent\u2014I
        got to do it on my own. He\u2019d always say, \u201cYou can\ngo up to that
        coffee can and just take some money out of there if you need something.\u201d
        I said,\n\u201cDad could you loan me some money for a clay mixer?\u201d He
        said, \u201cNo.\u201d And I was so upset, so\nhurt. He was bailing my brother
        out of businesses. He said, \u201cBecause you have to develop a\ncredit history,
        I\u2019ll go to the bank and I\u2019ll cosign on the loan.\u201d So we marched
        over to North St.\nPaul, the bank\u2014and I was just twenty-three\u2014I
        remember that, just going over there with him,\nand sitting down with the
        president, or the guy who ran the bank, and borrowed I think a\nthousand dollars
        for this clay mixer and dad cosigned. I paid every month; I paid the bank
        and\nfinally paid it off. That was the best lesson from him, to be independent
        financially. That was a\ngood lesson. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n33\nI decided to model
        it after the Leach Pottery. I was going to spend so many hours doing\nfunctional
        ware, production ware, all the kind of [unclear], as we did in England. And
        half the\ntime doing one-of-a-kind pieces. So I had a catalog published and,
        Okay, this is what I\u2019m going\nto do now. I had the catalog and this basket
        of samples and I went around to all these craft shops\nin Minnesota, and no
        one bought anything. No one ordered anything except a place on Arcade in\nSt.
        Paul, but they never paid me for them. So the whole thing just fizzled.\nThen
        I thought, I\u2019ll make tiles. The Leach Pottery made tiles during the First
        World War, Second\nWorld War, to survive. I thought, I\u2019ll make tiles,
        then I can train someone else to do it. So I\nfigured out how to make tiles
        and I had a catalog printed and I was going to send those off to all\nthe
        interior designers and decorators in the state, and I had lists of those.
        I never sent them out. I\nguess I got a check from a gallery or something
        and just canned that whole idea. Oh, I know\nwhy! I made tiles for the kitchen
        and the bathroom and then I made tiles for a friend\u2019s floor, I\nmade
        a thousand tiles. I thought, Ick, I hate this, this is boring. So I just skipped
        that.\nWhat the Leach Pottery did\u2014when he started that place in 1920\u2014is
        that he had raku Sundays,\nwhere he would build a raku kiln and he\u2019d
        make the pots and he would bisque them, and then\npeople could come and just
        decorate them\u2014pot them, and bingo! That\u2019s how he would educate\npeople.
        So, I tried that, put up posters in town. Only one person showed up. It was
        Gary, my\nfriend from high school with his two kids. So there was no interest
        in that, no interest in tiles, no\ninterest in the production ware. Everything
        just flopped. It was all a blessing in disguise; I could\njust make what I
        want to make now, and that\u2019s just who I am.\nSo, you know, I was trying
        to force these things on that my heart was only half way\u2014but I did\ndo
        commissions for years, on a dinnerware set or something. But I stopped doing
        that when I\nturned fifty. No more commissions because they always bomb out.
        I\u2019m going off to teach\ntableware next week, and thinking\u2014Oh boy,
        I gotta story\u2014\nWhen I was first up here, Mike Maguire bought a building
        in Stillwater. It was a restaurant\nopening up\u2014in this brick\u2014it
        wasn\u2019t The Dock, it was another building. And he redesigned it\nand it
        was a restaurant and they wanted handmade pots, so the owner of the restaurant
        came up\nwith the chef and said, \u201cWe need two hundred and fifty place
        settings.\u201d I said, \u201cSure,\u201d and I gave\nhim a rock bottom price
        because I was starving. And he brought up a stainless steel cover that\nyou
        put on plates to keep the food warm before it\u2019s buzzed out. He said,
        \u201cThe plates have to fit\nunderneath that.\u201d So I took a stack of
        plates out of the cupboard and they fit perfectly. So I just\nmade two hundred
        and fifty plates. The whole kiln was solid plates, I had five hundred plates
        in\nthe kiln, big and small plates. I had to borrow shelves from people\u2014I
        had a shelf every two\ninches. I had a big walk-in kiln then. So I unstacked
        the kiln and I checked the lid and the lid\ndidn\u2019t fit. All the plates
        were about a quarter inch too big. And I thought, Awww. What\nhappened was
        my clay\u2014I was adding more sand in my clay for texture and it wasn\u2019t
        shrinking\nenough. I didn\u2019t know that. So I had to make all the plates
        over again. I thought, Oh god. And\nthen what happened was that people were
        stealing plates and cups from the restaurant, so they\nhave to order more.
        So I had to build a small kiln just so I could process those and remake some\nmore.
        It was just getting to be too much. And then the demise of the project was
        the chef ran off\nwith the owner\u2019s wife and they just closed the restaurant,
        and they threw all the pots in the\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ.
        Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n34\ndumpster. Oh, thank god. (wipes hands) Then about
        a week later, I remember I was at my\nparents\u2019 house, someone tracked
        me down, this Japanese guy, said, \u201cI\u2019m opening up a Japanese\nrestaurant,
        would you make six hundred covered rice bowls?\u201d (Gasp) I said, \u201cNo
        thank you.\u201d\nI was trying to model my place after the Leach Pottery,
        which just wasn\u2019t, it just didn\u2019t work. I\ndidn\u2019t have any
        role models.\n02:01:50\nAW: How did the production ware sell?\nJO: No one
        ordered any of it, just didn\u2019t. And I realize too, that it was too early
        in my\u2014I needed\nmore time to get things developed and mature as a potter.
        I was just not mature as a potter. So, it\nwas just bad timing\u2014and that
        system, that\u2019s great, say if you had an apprentice that you can train\nto
        make that, you can guide them along as a teaching tool. But I\u2019m not a
        teacher. So my income\ncame from people that dropped in daily. I had a big
        sign out on 95 [Minnesota highway] that\nsaid, \u201cShowroom Open.\u201d
        It was a big eight by ten sign out there with an arrow. And people\nwould
        stop by out of curiosity here, this was like forty years ago, they\u2019d
        think, Oh what is this?\nSo I\u2019d take them through the pottery and I\u2019d
        make a cup on the wheel, then take them in the\nhouse and have coffee with
        them, and show them, \u201cNow you choose your own cup,\u201d and take\nthem
        through and educate them. By the end of the day I was just so wired up from
        coffee. And\nthen I finally took the sign down because I was getting people
        in that, just curiosity. By that time\nit had built up to people who were
        knowledgeable would stop in. So I\u2019ve always had a showroom\non-site and
        people would just stop in. There\u2019s a basket\u2014they just leave money
        because it\u2019s self-service.\nThat\u2019s the MacKenzie whole thing\u2014just
        leave a check out there or something.\nThe tour now has kind of overtaken
        the daily\u2014not a lot of daily drop-ins anymore, people wait\nuntil we
        have the Tour. It\u2019s a big event. I wish there were more daily drop-ins
        because it\u2019s hard\nto educate people and talk when there are a thousand
        people here. My goal is to be able to sell it\nall from the showroom. It\u2019s
        never going to happen. I\u2019ll always need galleries. They provide a\ncertain
        function, and then the Tour provides a function, and the daily drop-ins too,
        people do\nstop. I need that.\nI remember that Janet Leach told me that, \u201cWe\u2019re
        training people here to be potters, not\nteachers.\u201d And so, maybe ten
        years went by, after I came back, and I got a call to come and teach\nat a
        school in Memphis. I was feeling isolated then, and I thought, Oh really?
        I\u2019d love to do that.\nSo I moved down to Memphis for six months. I love
        teaching, but I still had this in the back of\nmy head, this voice, \u201cOh,
        you\u2019re betraying your cause, you should be a potter,\u201d that purist
        thing.\nI liked it, so then I spent about ten years going around to various
        universities and teaching first\nsemester here, a year there, all over the
        country. I loved it! Then I was just thinking, No. I needed\nmore time to
        work, I needed solitude, privacy\u2014and when you teach full-time you give
        yourself\nover to it. I applied for MacKenzie\u2019s job when he retired and
        I didn\u2019t get it. They were down to\ntwo people and I didn\u2019t get
        it. Thank God I didn\u2019t get it, it would\u2019ve ruined me\u2014blessing
        in\ndisguise. I was getting towards the end of the teaching, so I thought,
        I\u2019ll teach at the best\u2014so I\ntaught at RISD [Rhode Island School
        of Design] in Rhode Island. It\u2019s just one of the best art\nschools in
        the country. They called me up and said, \u201cWould you teach?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d
        I didn\u2019t like it. I\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n35\ndidn\u2019t
        really like it. I thought, This is over, it\u2019s not\u2014teaching is not\u2014I\u2019m
        not made for it as a\ncareer. But I love teaching weekend workshops, it\u2019s
        love \u2018em and leave \u2018em. I whip in for a\ncouple of days and tsch
        tsch, get them all charged up. I do a couple, usually weeklong classes,\nI\u2019ll
        do that\u2014weeklong class. And that\u2019s fine, but long-term, grades and
        all that, committee\nmeetings, and (groan). It\u2019s not it for me. There
        are people that are far better at it, who really need\nthe income. So I feel
        just honored that I\u2014every check that I get, I\u2019m just so, \u201cOh
        thank you,\nthank you for supporting me.\u201d It\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m
        so grateful.\n02:06:08\nAW: So you were a teacher\u2014this was the mid to
        late seventies that you were doing some of\nthese teaching things?\nJO: Late
        seventies through the eighties. Then I thought, This isn\u2019t going to cut
        it. Then in \u201891, I\nthink it was my last year of teaching, \u201891 or
        \u201892, I was teaching in New York, at Alfred, New\nYork, and then Rhode
        Island, and just realized \u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s not my calling.\nAW: And
        then would you come back here to\u2014? So you had this place the whole time?
        You were\njust going off and traveling\u2014?\nJO: Yep, renting an apartment,
        rent a house\u2014close this place up. It\u2019s odd how it\u2019s all worked
        out\nthe way it\u2019s supposed to have worked out, I think.\nAlso, when I
        was teaching at these great art schools, teaching alongside people who had
        been\nteaching all their life, it was just in their blood. It wasn\u2019t
        in my blood.\nAW: So at the same time though, you were developing your own
        type of pottery, the pottery you\nwanted to do. How would you describe that?
        Can you tell us a little bit more about the type of\nclay, the glazes you
        were using, and things like that?\nJO: When I look back I go through these
        decades. The first decade was I did gas reduction firing\nin a big gas kiln.
        And then, at that tenth year, I was invited to teach at the Kansas City Art\nInstitute\u2014a
        great school\u2014and they had a wood kiln, so I fell in love with wood. So
        I came back\nhere and I ripped down the gas kiln and built a wood kiln. And
        then ten years of that, then Alfred\ncalled me, \u201cWill you please come
        and teach for a semester?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d I get there and
        I\nwas teaching a lot of students, and they had, gosh, they had maybe twenty-five
        kilns there. And\nthey had a kiln\u2014it\u2019s a soda kiln--and I fell in
        love with that soda process. They were doing\noxidation soda, which was really
        odd, but you\u2019ve got this range of colors\u2014I just love the colors.\nI
        had a student, Nicholas Seidner, was in the class, it was a sophomore class,
        and I wanted to do\nthis big, huge celadon-testing extravaganza. So I got
        a hundred and fifty celadon formulas and\neach student got ten of them. And
        Nicholas, I gave him ten or a dozen, I said, \u201c\u2019Okay, test these\nin
        gas reduction, soda oxidation, wood firing, and something else.\u201d So we
        had fifteen hundred\ntiles out on the table. This amazing range of celadons\u2014it
        was so cool. There was one glaze I got\nfrom Helene, who spent the summer
        at the Leach Pottery. All celadons have a little bit of iron in\nthem to give
        them that jade color. This one didn\u2019t; it had a little bit of copper.
        So I said, \u201cThat\u2019s\nnot going to work.\u201d But I said, \u201cNicholas,
        run it through anyway, we\u2019ll just see.\u201d And this glaze\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n36\ncame out of the
        soda kiln, this beautiful turquoise gray. I just thought, Oh my, it\u2019s
        so gorgeous.\nSo I name it\u2014the glaze\u2014\u201cNick\u2019s Misfire.\u201d
        And you\u2019ll see that glaze in buckets around the\ncountry. So that\u2019s
        the history of \u201cNick\u2019s Misfire.\u201d And you see that glaze, you
        type it in there\u2014\nso that\u2019s how it got going, so I named it after
        Nicholas Seidner. I haven\u2019t seen him since. But I\u2019m\nteaching a
        class in Italy next summer and they love oxidation soda. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s
        get Nick to\ncome to be\u2014,\u201d but there wasn\u2019t enough time to
        do that. But anyway, so I came back from\nAlfred, ripped down my wood kiln
        and built a soda kiln, just for that glaze. I could never get it.\nNext kiln,
        couldn\u2019t get it, third kiln, couldn\u2019t get it\u2014could never get
        that glaze. My kilns\nnaturally reduce a little bit. So I\u2019ve never been
        able to get that here.\nIt was at that time, when I was switching to soda,
        I didn\u2019t quite know where I was going to\u2014\nwhat I wanted to do with
        it, other than that one glaze. I was traveling in New Zealand, and I was\nthere\u2014I
        got an award, so they flew me over. We did some traveling around the country
        and one\nday I walked into this village on the north island, Napier. And Napier,
        in 1928, was destroyed by\nthis massive earthquake; all the commercial buildings,
        a hundred of them, were just were\ndemolished. So they rebuilt all the buildings
        in the Art Deco style because they were poured\nconcrete, they were earthquake
        proof, they were kind of the rage at the time, and they were\ninexpensive.
        They were basically concrete that they put all this \u201cicing\u201d on it,
        all these colors and\ndetail, just fluff it all up. And I walked in and I
        said, \u201cOh,\u201d (sigh), this is what I\u2019ve been looking\nfor.\u201d
        Art Deco (gasp) design classes at Bemidji State, it\u2019s all just strict
        design. I thought, It\u2019s just\npure design. I thought (gasp), This is
        it! This is what I\u2019ve been looking for. That coupled with a\ndiscovery
        of the arts and crafts movement, the tiles that were made in the twenties
        and thirties, a\nbeautiful range of matte glazes from Pewabic, Roseville,
        Rookwood, all those potters doing that\nsame kind of matte. I just thought,
        I love these glazes! But I was trained on celadons, khakis,\ntenmokus, shinos,
        and so to switch over to that was a leap. It kind of fit where my work was\ngoing
        shape-wise, it just kind of fit in with that. Now if I take a shino glaze
        on my pots now, it\ndoesn\u2019t look right. They don\u2019t fit.\nSo my work
        is a lot of geometry, but I\u2019ve been missing what I fell in love with
        in clay was the\nround, organic forms, all about curves. I\u2019m missing
        that fullness and that\u2014I\u2019m missing it. I can\u2019t\ngo back there
        because my work is faceted, and this, and that, and the other. But I\u2019ve
        been kind of\nsneaking up on it in the last series I was doing\u2014some oval
        things and trying to find some\npatterns that are more organic. I don\u2019t
        know where it\u2019s going to go, what\u2019s going to come out of\nit, but\u2014.\nThe
        work I\u2019ve been doing lately, that is more personal than any work I\u2019ve
        ever done, is when I\nhad those pianos rebuilt, I got all the bass strings.
        I\u2019m nuts about copper, I\u2019ve always loved\ncopper. And my pottery,
        the main work area, I finally finished it. I wanted it to be a really\nbeautiful
        space, so it\u2019s all cherry paneling and there\u2019s copper\u2014I made
        cabinets for all my tools, I\nmade copper fronts on them. So I can draw on
        them with white pencil, so I can just erase it.\nThey\u2019re drawing boards
        yet they\u2019re copper. I\u2019ve put copper trim on the edges and I have
        copper\nwall plates, and I just love copper. So I said, \u201cWhat can I do
        with these bass strings?\u201d So I did a\nseries of covered forms and I make
        a copper loop handle for it, I bend it and I wrap it with silver\naround that.\nSo
        I took one of the bass strings, I wound it in between the copper wire\u2014I
        got silver\u2014and then I\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n37\nmade
        tea caddies. That\u2019s with the copper wire there, it\u2019s hard to see
        in the dark here. So I called\nthem \u201cAudreanna Tea Caddies Mason Hamlin,\u201d
        because this piano is named Audreanna, that\u2019s\nGerald. So they\u2019re
        called \u201cAudreanna Tea Caddies Mason Hamlin,\u201d that\u2019s the brand.
        And that\none, I got the tuning pins from that\u2014I use the tuning pins,
        I cut them in half, and set those in\nthere for the knobs on those. And that\u2019s
        how I honor my parents, because the pianos are named\nin their honor. So that\u2019s
        the work to me that\u2019s got that story, which is the most personal. And
        I\u2019m\njust having a great time working on this idea.\n02:15:00\nAW: Yeah,
        you have this story now with each piece that can be told. I remember from
        the very\nbeginning of the interview you were saying, you know, \u201clove
        of objects\u201d and the stories that they\ntell.\nJO: You know, that love
        of objects is, I know there\u2019ll be a time when I have to send things\ndown\u2014say
        when I have to head off to the \u201chome\u201d\u2014I can\u2019t imagine
        saying good-bye to these\nthings. I just love things. I love objects\u2014I
        like to devour them and have them. I wish it would\nease up a bit, but it
        hasn\u2019t now because the spaces are full. But still you see something out
        there,\na beautiful fabric or something\u2014like, I\u2019m a closet knitter.
        This is my knitting right here.\nAW: Oh yeah?\nJO: I love yarn! I just started
        five years ago. I have just boxes and boxes of yarn upstairs. I just\nlove
        materials. That\u2019s central to it all, I love materials, be it clay, that
        [yarn]\u2014And when I was in\nSouth Africa teaching I brought back a whole
        suitcase full of shway-shway material and I tried to\nlearn to sew. That was
        a disaster, but I just love material. I love just touch, the feel\u2014I just
        love\nmaterials [opens bag]. This is a Japanese yarn\u2014I just do scarves\u2014it\u2019s
        got some silk in it.\nAW: Oh, that\u2019s so gorgeous. Yeah, knitting\u2014I
        find it very soothing.\nJO: It is, and it boosts the serotonin in your brain.
        I really love the whole history of knitting. But\nnow there\u2019s so many
        great yarns out there. You go into a yarn shop and, \u201cI don\u2019t need
        any more\nyarn, I\u2019ve got enough to last for three lifetimes.\u201d Like,
        \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that beautiful?\u201d You just want\nto have it. My mom,
        she sewed all the time, she had a bumper sticker that said, \u201cThe one
        that\ndies with the most fabric wins.\u201d (laughs).\nAW: (Laughter) That\u2019s
        right, you were saying\u2014so, your mom was a pianist, a professional\npianist,
        and then she stopped?\nJO: Yeah, she was trained and she stopped to raise
        her kids, she never went back.\nAW: Were there other crafts that she did?\nJO:
        She sewed all the time, and knit. She knit until almost the day she died,
        the same scarf over\nand over and over again\u2014this cool little design.
        I think it\u2019s from childhood, \u201cDon\u2019t just sit\naround, do something.\u201d
        So we were always doing something while we were watching TV, just\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n38\nmaking stuff. I
        found out when I was researching my mom\u2019s background that\u2014where
        did mom,\nwhere did her love of sewing come from? When she was born\u2014I
        found a letter in her desk when\nI cleaned out her desk about her background\u2014that
        she\u2014you know her mother died in childbirth.\nSo the baby was just handed
        to her grandmother, \u201cPlease raise her.\u201d So my grandmother raised\nmy
        mom. I found in a census records, when I was researching, that my great-grandmother,
        she\nwas a seamstress, that\u2019s how she made a living to raise my mom.
        And so that\u2019s where my mom\nlearned to sew. And mom would make my dad\u2019s
        suits; she made all the drapes and curtains in the\nhouse. She just was sewing\u2014my
        sisters\u2014they were sewing all the time. The dining room table\nas a kid\u2014they
        were always cutting patterns out on that. And there was always an ironing
        board\nthere with a ham on it. You know what a ham is? It\u2019s for sewing,
        for ironing. It looks like a ham,\nbut it\u2019s stuffed with material and
        then it\u2019s felting on the outside, for ironing cuffs and sleeves and\nsmaller
        parts. So there were all of these patterns around and I loved watching them
        and I loved\npatterns. And my love of pattern, I\u2019m certain, comes from
        these patterns they were always\nworking with.\nAW: And your grandmother\u2019s
        name was Blanche?\nJO: Um hmm.\nAW: What were your parent\u2019s names again?\nJO:
        Audreanna and Gerald.\nAW: You named the pianos after each of your parents?\nJO:
        Yep, some people name their grand pianos after their\u2014they have names
        for them. So that\u2019s\nGerald, and that\u2019s my dad\u2019s high school
        picture on that one. And this\u2014Audreanna\u2014and her high\nschool picture\u2019s
        on that one, and then a little sealed container. There are some of her ashes
        in\nthere; I have it sealed up.\n02:20:22\nAW: And it was Audreanna\u2019s
        family that had some Swedish background?\nJO: Yeah, she\u2019s Swedish. And
        how her name came about: I found this one letter that told about\nher background.
        This letter was written about 1940. She wrote a relative, \u201cTell me more
        about\nmy background.\u201d She didn\u2019t know, so the story got told. We
        won\u2019t go into much of it now, but\nso when my grandmother died in childbirth,
        she just\u2014they took the two grandmothers\u2019 names\nand combined it.
        \u201cAudrey\u201d and \u201cAnna\u201d became \u201cAudreanna.\u201d\nAW:
        So you really have Swedish and German background?\nJO: Yeah, some Norwegian
        and a little Welsh in there. But mom was very elegant, tall, lithe,\nwell
        educated, very gracious, and she had this sense of style and I don\u2019t
        know where that came\nfrom. She\u2019d spend the summers with my grandfather
        and his second wife, Lillian, and then go\nback to this small, rural town
        during the school year. She was kind of shuttled back and forth,\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n39\nwhich wasn\u2019t
        an easy situation. I found out because there was a lot of jealousy between
        my\ngreat-grandmother and my grandmother. So my mom had this life in this
        small, little farming\ntown, in a little, tiny house that she was raised in,
        and then she\u2019d go to my grandfather\u2019s house\u2014\nhe was a wealthy
        doctor with a second wife\u2014so there were these two worlds and it was very\ndifficult.\nSo,
        my grandfather\u2019s second wife, I remember her. She and Fred came to visit
        us in White Bear\nLake in 1958. From there they drove to California to visit
        their son, they had just one son\u2014and\nhis partner, he was gay\u2014way
        back when. And they\u2019re pulling into the driveway\u2014because I\nfound
        the article\u2014they were pulling into the driveway and a car hit them broadside
        and she was\nthrown from the car and she died right there, and her son witnessed
        the accident. So, I was in\nL.A. a couple months ago and I said, \u201cI have
        to go to this house.\u201d So it took me days to find it on\nthe internet.
        I went through city directories from \u201858, I was finally able to find
        the house. So,\nthat\u2019s where my [step] grandmother\u2014that\u2019s where
        she died. So I had to go there to honor her.\nAnd so my grandfather then,
        he lost his will to live and he came to live with us, and he died in\n\u201959.\nAW:
        Oh, that\u2019s so hard\u2014\nJO: So, both his wives he lost\u2014\nAW: In
        really tragic ways\u2014\nJO: Yeah, sad.\nAW: And you\u2019re father\u2019s
        family, did you know them as well?\nJO: Yes, that\u2019s from the Iron Range\u2014\nAW:
        Yeah, the Iron Range, yeah\u2014\nJO: Yep.\nAW: Wow\u2014sorry, one other
        follow-up. Your siblings and their names?\nJO: My oldest brother is Chip\u2014\nAW:
        Yeah, and what do they do?\nJO: Chip, he\u2019s retired, he worked for Quest.
        Well he was trained as a pilot, but then got off into\nother jobs and the
        last bit of his career was working for Quest. And he bought the land right
        next\nto the family cabin\u2014came up for sale, so his heart\u2019s there.
        And I can understand him being there,\nit\u2019s full of memories. And my
        next brother, that\u2019s Mike, and his degree was from Macalester in\npolitical
        science, he\u2019s a plumber now. It\u2019s like none of them\u2014they\u2019re
        just in different careers\nnow. Linda, she\u2014I can\u2019t remember what
        her field was in college, but she worked for the phone\ncompany for years
        and years. She\u2019s working for St. John\u2019s as a nursing staff, she\u2019s
        sixty-five.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n40\nDeanna,
        she\u2019s teaching Spanish. Nancy is a social worker\u2014trained in the
        flute, but then went\ninto social work. So none of them really did what they
        studied. None of them really kind of\npursued\u2014they got off on these other
        tangents.\n02:25:00\nAW: You were saying when growing up, everybody had some
        kind of craft they did most of the\ntime.\nJO: They did\u2014The house was
        full of music too. Piano, organ lessons, drums going, and\nclarinets\u2014it
        was just mom felt we all had to study this and we all did.\nAW: But it sounds
        like you\u2019re the only one who pursued a career in the arts.\nJO: Um hm\u2014but
        in this chaotic family I wanted to escape, so I would gravitate toward solitary\nactivities.
        I\u2019d go off and paint, I\u2019d take my bike, I\u2019d just really needed
        solitude. Even to this day I\nneed\u2014I have to balance this out of solitude
        and people. Like I\u2019ve been feeling cut off lately. I\nguess I\u2019ve
        never felt lonely, but I\u2019ve been feeling lonely since we had the Tour
        here. And I\u2019ve\nnever felt lonely; I have to identify this. I just feel
        something. So I can\u2019t wait to get off and teach.\nI think I\u2019m entering
        another phase in my evolution as a person. Just another decade or something,\nthere\u2019s
        something else is happening in my thought and I need to be around more people.
        This is a\nnew deal for me. Then I thought, Did I make the right choice living
        out here? But this place has\nbeen built for making work, which I\u2019ll
        always be doing.\nAW: Well, speaking of people; let\u2019s get into the Tour
        a bit more. So you said you moved out\nhere and shortly after some of the
        other potters moved out here. How did you get to know each\nother?\nJO: Janel
        was the first person who moved up here and I think she heard there was another
        potter\nin the area and she just stopped by. Also, there was the Minnesota
        Craft Council, which has\ndisbanded since then, and I headed up the membership
        committee, so I\u2019d get Linda and Janel\nover here and we\u2019d work on
        our membership stuff. So that was kind of a link there, too. Linda\nmoved
        up, maybe a couple years after that, and she knocked on the door, \u201cCan
        I work here?\u201d She\nworked here for about a year, then she bought a place.\nAW:
        How was that? What was that like to have someone here all year round?\nJO:
        It was good. Pat was the first one that knocked on the door in 1975, in January.
        She\u2019s my\noldest friend, we were always in contact and she shows here
        with the Tour and I go out there and\nshow at her place. We\u2019re going
        to England to work together at the Leach Pottery\u2014that\u2019s Pat, my\noldest
        friend (points to photograph). So there have been about twenty people who
        have worked\nhere in the studio over the years on and off. But now, I sold
        my extra wheels and closed \u201cclay\ncamp.\u201d I mean now it\u2019s just
        down to one person in a private studio and that\u2019s probably how it\nwill
        be.\nAW: Tell us about the \u201cclay camp\u201d again?\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nJ. Oestreich\n06\/09\/14\n41\nJO: I\u2019d be off in
        the world and I\u2019d meet people, and I thought, Oh, why don\u2019t you
        come here and\nwork? And so that worked out because we had the Tour, and that
        was established so they could\nfly over here one year ahead. I had two, or
        three, from Australia; then I had a couple from New\nZealand and a friend

        Swanson (1947-) grew up in Minnesota and studied ceramics, art and design
        at the University of Minnesota. After working at Fairview Hospital for fifteen
        years, Swanson married Janel Jacobson and began making pottery full-time at
        their home studio in Sunrise Township, Minnesota. He also helped co-found
        the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour. Janel Jacobson (1950-) grew up in various

        before establishing her own studio in the St. Croix Valley. After graduating,
        she studied studio pottery techniques with renowned Bauhaus artist Marguerite
        Wildenhain, but soon adopted her own style of carving small sculptures in
        clay. In 1995, Janel stopped carving in stoneware and porcelain and began
        using wood.  In this interview, Swanson and Jacobson discuss their respective
        childhoods; ceramics education; connections to the local and national pottery
        communities; and thoughts on the past, present and future of the St. Croix
        Valley Pottery Tour. This interview was conducted by local oral historian
        and PhD Candidate from the University of Minnesota Anduin Wilhide. \"\"A Measure
        of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley\"\"
        explores the anomalous community of potters in Eastern Minnesota who host
        an annual cooperative tour for participating ceramic artists from around the
        world. This annual three-day event attracts art enthusiasts from across the
        country. Together the project''s ten oral history interviews, representing
        diverse perspectives from within the local pottery community, tell the story
        of how, from the 1950s to today, Minnesota\ufffds St. Croix River Valley has
        developed into a major center for pottery, and a destination for thousands
        nationally.","dat":"2014-06-30","publia":"American Craft Council Library","dimens":"04:40:47","genera":"The

        Will Swanson and Janel Jacobson on June 30, 2014, in\nSunrise, Minnesota,
        at their home. This interview is for the \u201cA Measure of the Earth: An
        Oral\nHistory of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,\u201d made possible
        by the Minnesota Historical\nand Cultural Heritage Grants. Also present during
        this interview is Tierney McNabb, our project\nassistant. Thank you for agreeing
        to be interviewed and why don\u2019t we get started? Janel, we\u2019ll\nstart
        with you. Can you tell us a little bit about where you were born and where
        you grew up?\nJJ: I was born in Minneapolis and shortly after I was born we
        moved to Alaska because my\nfather was in the service. He was a flight surgeon.
        We moved back to Minneapolis and we spent\nsome years there and some years
        in Rochester [Minnesota], following dad for specialty medical\ntraining. Then
        we moved back up to Golden Valley [Minnesota], where he joined a specialty\npractice.
        Mom was the person who was most prominent in our lives and she made sure that
        we\nhad good time outdoors. We went up to the North Shore and took nature
        walks and rock hunting,\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson
        and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n2\ntouching trees and feeling things. On rainy
        days we had little art projects we\u2019d do at home among\nother things,
        but mom was a good guide for us in our younger years.\nAW: And when were you
        born?\nJJ: 1950.\nAW: Any siblings?\nJJ: Siblings? I have an older sister
        and a younger brother and a younger sister.\nAW: When you started to go to
        school, were you in Alaska or in Minneapolis?\nJJ: We moved away from Alaska
        before I had real memories, maybe two years of age. I started\ngoing to school
        when we lived in South Minneapolis. Kindergarten, first, second and third
        grade.\nI finished third grade in Rochester and moved away at the end of fifth
        grade and moved to\nGolden Valley for sixth grade. I was there for six through
        twelve then graduated and went on to\ncollege.\nAW: And where did you go to
        college?\nJJ: Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.\nAW: When you were in school,
        you mentioned some art projects and things like that at home.\nDid you also
        have anything like that at school?\nJJ: I started out as a biology major,
        but when in my second year I was faced with college level\nchemistry, my high
        school didn\u2019t prepare me for that so I had to drop out of the major.
        I couldn\u2019t\ntake the subsequent science courses because I couldn\u2019t
        pass chemistry. So I switched in the\nmiddle of that first semester to an
        art major which suited me very well. In my junior year I\nstarted making pottery
        and that was it. It superseded any other interest I had in school and I spent\nas
        much time as I could making pots because I loved it so much. I ended up being
        the student\nassistant and the main go to person when the teacher wasn\u2019t
        there. I would help load kilns and do\nthings like that.\nAW: Who was your
        teacher?\nJJ: Dean Schwarz. He went abroad for a semester on a Fulbright Scholarship
        and left a graduate\nstudent in charge of the class, I think, it was a long
        time ago. At that time it was very helpful but\nI also did a lot of work.
        It helped me understand that it is a whole way of life being a potter\nbecause
        of the time and commitment it takes to bringing pots from the clay stage all
        the way to\nbeing fired and putting them out there. I was ready for it when
        I left college. I wanted to not take\nanother job. For me it was all or nothing,
        pottery only, and not split my time between having to\nwork first and then
        make pots like a hobby. It was too important for me. And I haven\u2019t held
        a\nregular job my whole life (laughs)! We\u2019re surviving.\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n3\nMy path,
        once becoming a potter, I rented studio space or was involved in different
        studios for\nthree years after graduation. After the third experience I was
        really ready to have my own studio\nand so I looked away from the city, about
        an hour or hour and a half away. On the trip through\nthis area I was introduced
        to this house and felt it was the best of all options I had seen at that\npoint.
        It\u2019s a little close to a highway, but it\u2019s quite rural. And it\u2019s
        a county highway not a main\nhighway. I was able to purchase the house contract
        for deed, and at that time I was twenty-four.\nSo it was a big experiment
        and I love being here. I lived here from 1975 through 1984, before\nmeeting
        Will Swanson, my husband, and he moved up here in 1985 and we were married
        in\n1986, when we began to share the studio as potters. Will can tell you
        his history, but he wasn\u2019t a\nfull-time potter when we met, but he became
        that.\nThrough my years of making pots I\u2019ve made useful functional pottery.
        I\u2019ve developed glazes and\ntried to keep a reasonable supply of seven
        different colors, or glazes. I went to regional art fairs\nand the Minnesota
        Renaissance Festival. I started going there in 1972 right after graduating
        from\ncollege as an add-on to somebody else who was already doing the show
        and I was renting studio\nspace from him. We quit doing it in 1983, I think\u2014\n00:07:15\nWS:
        Ninety-three.\nJJ: Ninety-three. Excuse me. After Avery was born.\nWS: Ninety-two
        was the last year actually.\nJJ: Oh, ninety-two. Okay.\nAW: So this is the
        Renaissance Festival?\nWS: Yes.\nJJ: When I first moved here in 1975 I was
        making pots but I found this house and bought it in the\nmiddle of winter
        in March and it was still snowing. The first leaves came out and then the\nflowers
        and those were all very wonderful and I spent time drawing them. Those eventually\nfound
        their way into being drawn onto tiles or onto pots. This was for fun and creative\ndevelopment
        and then making pots was my work. In the beginning I gave myself a little
        time to\ndo this, and then moved into spending a week and then two weeks.
        By the time I met Will, quite\na while back, from 1975 to 1980s, I was giving
        myself two months out of the year to explore. At\nthat time I was working
        with porcelain clay.\nAfter we were married I didn\u2019t want to stop doing
        the exploration with carving and we decided it\nwas time for me to stop making
        pottery altogether and focus on making my way with carving\nporcelain and
        working towards having a good inventory and good pieces for shows. That took\nme
        forward, with that, for nine or ten years. At some point the carving on the
        porcelain, some of\nthe subjects that had been shallow relief carving on the
        surface of lidded boxes enhanced with\nceladon glazes, some of the subjects
        started emerging three dimensionally. Some of the subjects\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n4\nlike tree
        frogs and toads started having more volume and I didn\u2019t like how that
        looked with the\nrest of the carving so I decided to try making small sculptural
        three-dimensional pieces, in\nporcelain still. For a few years it was quite
        frustrating for me and exciting at the same time\nbecause I love the carving
        aspect but I didn\u2019t like how the material responded and how it ended\nup
        as far as color or the tactile quality and how people responded to unglazed
        carved porcelain.\nBy 1995 I was very ready to switch to carving wood, which
        I did, in the springtime. Since then,\nI\u2019ve been carving wood and a little
        bit of mammoth tusk ivory and amber and antler, but mostly\nwood.\n00:10:30\nAW:
        So learning the functional pottery, is that what you learned at Luther? Or
        where did you\npick up that?\nJJ: Yes. That actually that brings in another
        area. At Luther, Dean Schwarz was associated with\nMarguerite Wildenhain from
        Pond Farm in California. She came to visit and did a workshop\nwhile I was
        still in school. She was old by that time but she was still holding summer
        sessions.\nShe had been holding nine-week sessions, which is a considerable
        length.\nWS: Do you want to describe who she is?\nJJ: Marguerite Wildenhain
        was in the first, um, ceramics apprenticeship program at the Bauhaus\nin Germany
        and was in the first group of masters that graduated or progressed through
        the years\nin that program. She and her husband, Frans Wildenhain, established
        a studio for a while, but\nwhen the war [World War II] took place she immigrated
        to the United States and Frans stayed\nbehind to serve in the war, whether
        he wanted to or not. Anyway, she landed in California\nultimately and with
        some others started an art colony at Pond Farm. Over time the rest left and\nshe
        retained ownership and started teaching classes. She would teach people how
        to make pots\nby following a series of shapes and forms, one related to the
        other. When we were there as\nstudents, I had already been through the training
        at college, so I didn\u2019t have to progress right\nfrom the beginning. She
        would assign tasks and decoration projects.\nMany students who have come from
        those classes still retain characteristics of having studied\nwith her. I
        remember her clearly saying, \u201cDon\u2019t make my pots when you leave
        here. Make your\nown pots; do your own things\u201d. There are things that
        are related to how I learned and how I\nthrow because of that, but I\u2019ve
        tried to not emulate what she did. Some of the things from there,\nthe more
        important things were the drawing classes we had on Wednesdays. The challenges
        that\nshe put before us were quite interesting and those skills stay with
        me when I\u2019m preparing to do a\ncarving now. One series of things that
        were paired for us to draw were a stone and a potato and\nyou\u2019d have
        to make one look hard and the other look organic. Or a peach and a plum where
        one\nis fuzzy and one is shiny. Or crumpled hard angular twisted wire and
        a soft ball of string. Or to\nlook at a dead tree with living parts and try
        to embody that as simply as you can in what is\ncharacteristic of it. So the
        training was to see and distill what is characteristic of something and\nthen
        be able to express it. That is part of what guides me when I\u2019m working
        towards doing a\ncarving.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson
        and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n5\nWS: Did you say when you were there?\nJJ:
        Um, 1972, 1974 and 1977. The first class was right after I graduated from
        college.\nWS: In the summer?\nJJ: Yes, in the summertime. In 1974 it was the
        summer before I moved up here and 1977 was\nafterwards.\nAW: Tell us a little
        bit more about what you were saying about your approach and influences of\nyour
        carving?\nJJ: Say again?\n00:15:00\nAW: You were just saying that by learning
        through the drawing classes and really distinguishing\ntexture. Is that something
        that has translated into how you approach your carving?\nJJ: Well, yeah, it
        was those drawing exercises that directly related to the beginning of carving.\nWe
        did carving on tiles and she [Wildenhain] would have us design pots by doing
        a line drawing\nwith a knife and then filling in with slip. That\u2019s very
        characteristic of her work and many\nstudents\u2019 work that have come from
        there. I did that a little bit but I didn\u2019t want to do it in the\nstyle
        that they were doing and started using my drawings as a basis. What interested
        me was\ncarving a little bit away and starting to make a little relief and
        adding a little bit more clay to\nmake something more sculptural on the surface
        rather than what we had been doing there. So,\nearly on the play of light
        and shadow with the unglazed clay surface this was appealing to me.\nWhen
        I wanted to try and represent a wild rose flower, for instance, on a piece
        of stoneware,\nthere is not much you can do to stoneware to make a delicate,
        elegant flower petal. So I layered\nporcelain clay onto a pot and then carved
        that and realized that the porcelain was a lovely\nmaterial for carving. I
        started then to throw little pots and carve wild roses onto there. That began\nmy
        porcelain carving. So the drawing classes, their influence, enabled me to
        move forward with\ncarving on clay. Carving now has been the continuum through
        all the mediums that I\u2019ve worked\nin. I consider the pieces that I\u2019m
        doing not carving like whittling kind of carving, rather I\nconsider them
        small sculptures because it takes a long time and it\u2019s just very small
        movements\ncompared to large movements that wood sculptors make with a mallet
        or hammer or something. I\nuse my fingers and tools, taking little bits away.\nAW:
        Why are you drawn to doing this carving, to creating these sculptures? What
        is it about it\nthat--?\nJJ: Well what keeps me doing it is that I love to
        do it. I get lost, I get absorbed, I am fascinated\nby the transition from
        a blank piece of wood and a lumpy roughed out design to and through the\ndifferent
        stages of being blocked out and then when the elegance starts happening, getting
        closer\nto the finished form. Then when the details start working together,
        the little nuances in the form\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.

        it\u2019s very compelling for me to want to get back to work. I\nget lost,
        I come up for air every once in a while. In the end, I hope there is something
        lovely that\nsomebody else will be moved by when they get to hold it or look
        at it. It\u2019s a very non-essential\nluxury item when you look at it from
        a practical standpoint. It\u2019s a very small, but maybe potent,\nand sometime
        interesting story, somewhere on a more intimate scale. Work you can hold in
        your\nhand.\nAW: Yeah you were just telling us about a piece you are working
        on now. Maybe you could kind\nof describe your process with that piece?\nJJ:
        Well, I was at a family gathering and there was a young boy who spent hours
        playing with a\nlarge rainbow colored umbrella. One thing he did in particular
        with the umbrella, he was\nstanding off to the side, he stretched his arms
        up high with the opened umbrella way up in the air\nand he very theatrically
        and slowly brought it straight down in front of him. As it hit his head he\nstarted
        going into a squat and he started closing the umbrella around himself. By
        the time he was\nin a full squat the umbrella was closed as far as it could
        go, and then he just stayed there for a\nminute or two. I was enthralled with
        the whole scene and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s got to be a netsuke.\nThat\u2019s
        a wonderful little image.\u201d\nSo it stuck with me and I have been trying
        to express that in the piece of wood. There are\nchallenges in trying to carve
        into the end-grain of a piece of wood to hollow out around the legs\nas you
        go into the concave area underneath the umbrella and decide what to keep and
        what not to\nkeep and still make it work. It\u2019s hard, one, to carve in
        an enclosed area, but I have just enough\ntools to make that work. Then trying
        to make the umbrella folds on the outside look convincing\nis the stage that
        I\u2019m at right now. Once I\u2019m done with those then I\u2019ll carve
        the inside folds of the\numbrella, which won\u2019t be cloth thin but I have
        to try to make them relate to the outside in some\nway. Then add the holes
        that will make it a real netsuke, which is, a not often used functional\nobject
        from Japan.\nJapanese men generally have used them because their kimonos don\u2019t
        have pockets and women\u2019s\nkimonos have large pockets. A netsuke is the
        connector or the toggle that tucks under the obi to\nattach by cord a pouch
        or smoking paraphernalia or a compartmented box that holds personal\nitems.
        Netsuke in the 20th and 21st century, are collectable items (the antiques
        are). There are a\nrelatively small number of netsuke carvers working in the
        world today. It\u2019s a scale I choose to\nwork in. I don\u2019t always carve
        netsuke, but it\u2019s the scale of the netsuke I choose to work in. I\nchoose
        to work small, in general, because my subjects are small. I\u2019m fascinated
        with tree frogs,\ntoads, small flowers and leaves, and I take artist\u2019s
        license with other things and make them small\nif I need to. The wood that
        I use is extremely hard, and working on a larger scale, I did two\npieces
        in the past year that are six inches tall, and for me those are very big.
        Very time\nconsuming to work on with a lot of detail, but, very satisfying
        to bring all that surface area\ntogether in a carving.\n00:23:30\nA Measure

        I was thinking back to when you were first telling us about growing up and
        your mom\ntaking you on nature trails and things. Why do you think she was
        so interested in having you get\nout in nature?\nJJ: Well, she grew up in
        southern Minnesota in the Heron Lake area, and she was an only child\nand
        her parents lived on a farm at first and worked in town depending on what
        they had to do.\nShe spent all her time or a lot of her time playing by herself
        outside. It was just natural for her to\nwant us to be outside because she
        wanted to be outside. She had to think of things for us to do if\nwe were
        pulling each other\u2019s hair out inside. Outside had a lot more space to
        run around in. I\nhave to credit her for my not being afraid of snakes or
        frogs or toads. In being comfortable\npicking up beetles carefully (laughs).
        Not all my siblings are like that. My younger sister is very\nmuch an outside
        person too. We\u2019re all different in what we\u2019ve chosen to do.\nAW:
        What have your siblings done? What careers did they pursue?\nJJ: Well, one
        sister is an IT person; presently she\u2019s working as a coordinator for
        teams that are\ndeveloping software for a company. My brother\u2014\nAW: What\u2019s
        her name?\nJJ: Laurie. L-A-U-R-I-E Jacobson. My brother Steve, or Steven Jacobson,
        has had different\ncareers that have followed an electronics and technical
        path. Before the kind of digital\nphotography that can generate larger photographs
        now, he worked with equipment that were\ncolor separators and did the scanning.
        Years ago. As that progressed he moved forward in that\nindustry until he
        and his wife started a business helping other small businesses do what they
        need\nto do as small businesses. And now, he is working for Mn\/DOT, the Minnesota
        Department of\nTransportation, again, in a technology area, working with the
        scanners and sensors in the road.\nUsing his wisdom there. My younger sister,
        she has a real regular day job. She works as a\nreceptionist in a clinic.
        Her name is Julie Schwartz. Her passion is gardening. She runs a seed\nexchange
        for interesting and heirloom seeds. She plants them all to see what they look
        like. She\nhas a huge yard that she works on all the time in. My mother\u2019s
        name is Jackie Jacobson.\nAW: And your father?\nJJ: Loren Jacobson. L-O-R-E-N.
        Jackie was actually Jacqueline, but everybody knows her as\nJackie.\nAW: Where
        did they meet? Is Loren also from southern Minnesota?\nJJ: Dad was from Rugby,
        North Dakota, and was going to school for pharmacy, becoming a\npharmacist,
        but it was early times of the [Korean] war. He passed the test that allowed
        him to\ntake medical school training and that launched him on the career of
        becoming a physician. She\nmet him while she was a nurse and he was a young
        doctor. The rest is history. The family started\nthen (laughs).\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n8\nAW:
        You said also that she encouraged art projects or craft projects? What kind
        of projects were\nthose?\nJJ: Well one memorable thing that we could all do
        together was that she\u2019d clean off the table,\nand I can\u2019t remember
        if she put something down or we just did it on the kitchen table, it was\nFormica
        or linoleum or something, and she\u2019d put finger paint on the table and
        we would just play\nand play and play. Or it might have been colored soapy
        bubbles and something or little knitting\nand loopy frame-weaving projects,
        just a variety of things. I can\u2019t remember any more. She did\nencourage
        us and on the side she would take correspondence courses for painting. She
        had to be\nhome so she couldn\u2019t go out and take lessons, so she did that.
        She always wanted to do more but\nshe was raising children, so she didn\u2019t.\n00:29:40\nAW:
        In school, this is sort of a follow up question, but in elementary or high
        school did you ever\ntake art classes?\nJJ: Oh sure. I can\u2019t remember
        if I did every year or every semester but it was something I wanted\nto do.
        I was also playing a musical instrument then, so the arts were a part of my
        life from sixth\ngrade on. As far as school I very much enjoyed the art classes.\nAW:
        What did you enjoy? What were some of your favorites?\nJJ: Well, in the later
        classes we were allowed to work maybe a little more independently on\nprojects
        and I remember using the acetylene torches and putting things together and
        trying a little\nbit of jewelry. When it was time to try making pots the teacher
        just opened the door and said,\n\u201clook at that chart and do what it says\u201d
        (laughs). So my introduction to clay wasn\u2019t very fruitful.\nIt took a
        better experience later on for me to find my way. I just like being involved
        in the arts. I\nalso enjoyed biology, which shows in my interest in things
        in nature. Watching, as much as I can\nfind, the stages of growth that katydids
        go through for instance, or tadpoles to frogs and knowing\na little bit about
        their scientific, or natural progression of what creatures go and grow through,\nand
        plants and flowers.\nAW: What high school did you go to?\nJJ: Golden Valley
        High School.\nAW: So it was class at Luther College when you got hooked on
        ceramics. What was it about it\nthat was so appealing to you right away?\nJJ:
        It felt good in my hands and I could make the clay move and it was kind of
        magical to move\nyour hands in such a way to cause something to be formed.
        Each successful step towards being\nable to make larger, bigger and deliberate
        shapes was self-rewarding in a way. It was something I\ncould challenge myself
        with and accomplish. It was easy to get hooked. I enjoyed the\ncamaraderie
        between the students and I liked, I\u2019m kind of a loner, so I liked the
        quiet times when\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J.
        Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n9\nthe classes weren\u2019t there when I could work
        and do something and be productive. I like doing\nthings. I\u2019m not a good
        couch potato.\nAW: When you graduated, walk us through how you kind of thought,
        \u201cokay, I\u2019m going to make\na go at this\u201d?\nJJ: I graduated and
        I had\u2014\nAW: That was in 1972?\n[Additional comment from JJ post-interview:
        When I graduated, my intention was one of all or\nnothing: make pots and survive
        financially. I did not want pottery making to be relegated to\nbeing pushed
        into hobby time activity outside of day-job working hours. I knew that my
        entire\nfocus needed to be towards making pottery for my living, and to support
        the love and respect that\nI had for it.]\nJJ: In 1972 and I had an interval
        between my first class at Pond Farm and I went to Pond Farm\nand that was
        a nine week experience which was very interesting and challenging. I camped
        out\nall summer and got put through the paces and got indoctrinated to the
        pace of Marguerite\u2019s\nclasses and getting to know who she was. She would
        read to us during our coffee breaks and\nhave philosophical discussions. There
        was very much more than what we had in college as far as\nclass work.\nWhen
        I left Pond Farm I came back and I don\u2019t exactly remember how it happened
        but I\nconnected with a potter who had a place in St. Paul and I rented studio
        space from him for half a\nyear, and then someone else. These were potters
        that were graduates of Luther. There was\nanother potter who, um, I knew at
        Luther who had a place in Illinois and he said, \u201cCome work\nhere for
        a while.\u201d So, I was there for about eight months, then moved back to
        the metro area\nwhen someone said, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you. I
        want you to come help me run this shop for a\nwhile.\u201d So I did that for
        about fourteen months. When I was done I was ready to not have to fit\nwhat
        I wanted to do into a routine that was dictated by where I was. Then I moved
        out to here.\n00:35:32\nAW: What was it about this place that was attractive
        to you?\nJJ: Well, for me it was that it had a big enough area to have a small
        studio in and it was a\nreasonable price for an old house. It needed a lot
        of work and it still does, but it was achievable\nand I could begin making
        it happen. Instead of doing a two building system like we have now,\nbeing
        alone, I could live and work in the same place and make it work.\nAW: So you
        had a studio in here [the house]?\nJJ: Yeah. In the room over there and in
        this room, that\u2019s where I made the pots. That\u2019s the parlor.\nI built
        ware racks on the walls and kind of had to walk sideways through everything
        [tables and\nwheels in the small room] when things were busy. In here there
        were ware racks and a\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and
        J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n10\nwoodworking bench and mostly ware racks. I tried
        keeping the floor clean so I wouldn\u2019t track it\n[clay] everywhere. I
        got a Shop-Vac and changed the filter a lot.\nAW: How old is this house?\nJJ:
        It was built in 1911, so it\u2019s one hundred and three years old. The very
        first year I had electric\nservice put on the back porch, which was then outside,
        now it\u2019s kind of an indoor space, and\nfired and glazed with an electric
        kiln. But I preferred gas firing so in that first year, the beginning\nof
        the second year, I arranged to have a kiln building built and I had a gas
        kiln built out there. I\nwanted to be in the country. I didn\u2019t want to
        be close to the city, which is one reason why I was\nlooking within an hour
        to an hour and a half drive from the city. So people could drive out for\npots
        on a day trip if they wanted to. And I wanted to be near a river. The Sunrise
        River goes kind\nof around, you can see the river or hear the river, from
        two or three sides of the house. We\u2019re\nabout a mile and a quarter from
        the St. Croix River, which is the [state] border.\nAW: Looks like a lot of
        trees and a wooded area, was that also appealing to be able to go outside\nand
        walk around and see the flowers and\u2014\nJJ: Yes, I can\u2019t imagine living
        smack dab in the middle of the city. I might have to someday but\nnow the
        few wonderful months we have of spring and summer go by so quickly. Every
        time\nwe\u2019re in the middle of it I think, this is where the memories are
        made for the many months of\nwinter that we have where it changes but its
        unchanging when it\u2019s cold and white. It\u2019s just very\nremarkable
        to be able to watch and recognize how things are changing how it sounds and
        how it\nsmells and how the light [changes] as the sun goes higher in the sky,
        and now as we\u2019re on the\nbeginning of the decent towards darkness (laughs).
        I worked so much this winter, every winter I\nlook forward to, well, my birthday
        is on the winter solstice, I look forward to that day because\nthe days will
        start getting longer very soon. I try to promise myself that I\u2019m going
        to recognize\nevery longer part of every day, but when I started working on
        the piece that I worked on from\nJanuary through the end of March I was just
        kind of blinded. I had so many hours every day that\nI had to work, and I
        wanted to work, that day length was kind of removed from my awareness\nuntil
        the end of March and April. By then it was already spring. So May and June
        [this year]\nhave been my months of awakening and enjoyment, I guess!\n00:40:15\nAW:
        When you bought the house were you able to do that on your own?\nJJ: Dad and
        mom cosigned the contract for deed and I occasionally needed to borrow money\nfrom
        him, which I did pay back as pots made money for me. It was a reasonable arrangement.\nBack
        then, in 1975, the property prices were far different then they are now. This
        house, and the\nhalf a city block that it is on, was eighteen thousand five
        hundred dollars. There\u2019s a bit across the\nroad that is partly on the
        Sunrise River between the highway and the road and that was three\nthousand.
        It had a big barn on it but that collapsed for various other reasons. So,
        the payments\nwere set at a reasonable amount and I had permission to double
        or triple them if I could and I did\nwhen I could. I was able to get close
        to paying it off, then when Will and I joined our resources\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n11\nwe were
        able to pay more and we did finally pay off the contract. I think I had a
        fifteen-year\ncontract. So, it worked.\nAW: That leads into another question.
        How did your family respond to your decision to pursue\nceramics?\nJJ: They
        were supportive. They would come up and help do things. Dad helped me to become\nfamiliar
        with using tools and impressed on me I could rely on other people for some
        things but\nthere were many things I could do myself. Mom came up and helped
        clean and paint and just to\nspend time. The whole family decided to have
        a big garden up here and for a few years we did\ngarden together and then
        I maintained it when they weren\u2019t here. The interest finally fell away\nbut
        everybody liked being here. Eventually, lives got busy and it got a whole
        lot more quiet.\nAW: So when you moved out here, what was it like?\nJJ: It
        was fairly quiet. Something that is missing now but was present back then
        was that there\nwere many more dairy farmers. There was a creamery truck that
        would drive by every day and\npick up milk from the various places. The other
        noisy thing would be gravel trucks that would\ndrive from up by Harris to
        somewhere with their loads. Now, we don\u2019t have the creamery trucks\nbut
        we have frac sand trucks driving by and dumping their loads in a gravel pit
        that was formed\nover the last fifteen years just to the east of here. They\u2019re
        not pleasant, but right now the bridge is\nbeing rebuilt so we don\u2019t
        have them driving by. And I hope that the frac sand agreement reaches\na conclusion
        here and moves somewhere else.\nAW: Tell us a little bit about that?\nJJ:
        North Branch, which is eight to ten miles away is known as a bedroom community.
        Out here\nthere is a mixture of old people and self-reliant people who do
        something on their own or people\nwho commute. So, the roadways are busy differently
        because we live eighty to a hundred feet\nfrom the county highway, there\u2019s
        more and less traffic during the day and [at] different times\nduring the
        day. Towards the evening, when people are done coming home, all the work trucks\nstop
        working and it\u2019s very quiet, very peaceful, and very pleasant to be outside.\nWe
        live on a road that goes north to Wild River State Park. During the summertime
        that is very\nbusy with canoe rental [vehicles]. So every now and then we
        have rattle-y contraptions going by,\nbut we know it\u2019s for fun.\n00:45:25\nAW:
        When you were looking at this location, is this part of why you ended up getting
        it, because\nit was so close to a county road?\nJJ: I think my father was
        pleased that it was less isolated because I was young and a girl. I\nwanted
        to be removed from buildings and cars and noise. I very much like solitude
        and actually\nin high school I worked at a canoe base. So working in northern
        Minnesota indoctrinated me to\nthe peaceful quiet way of living. This was
        a good compromise. The place was right for my\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n12\nmoving into. It was
        a compromise between being more accessible, from my parents\u2019 concerns\nand
        being close to the river and quiet spaces.\nAW: How did you build an audience
        at that time? Or who were your customers at that time?\nJJ: Well, I was hooked
        up with the Renaissance Festival by that time. The first year I went with
        a\nperson who had his own booth and I had a couple of pots in the corner.
        The next year I had my\nown booth and every other year after that I had my
        own booth. Through that I built a mailing list\nand audience interest. I also
        started doing regional art fairs in the metropolitan area and in St.\nCloud
        and built a mailing list from that. I started having spring and fall sales
        or late fall, early\nwinter Christmas sales\u2014\nWS: Here.\nJJ: Here at
        the studio. I had a showroom in the front room, the atrium that you walked
        into and\nthen up the stairs, which these days, isn\u2019t such a good idea,
        but it worked back then for most\npeople. It\u2019s funny, local people would
        sometimes stop and they would go up the stairs, older\nwomen especially, to
        look at the pots and I would hear them walking up the hallway and there is\na
        hallway with rooms on either side and I would hear them opening and closing
        all the doors.\nThey would say, \u201coh, I used to come over here and play
        with Franny and we could only go up\nthe back stairs and we never got to go
        anywhere else in the house\u201d (laughs). So they wanted to\nsee the rest
        of the house. It was so funny. I bought the house from the woman who lived
        next\ndoor who was born and raised in the house. We\u2019re the second owners.\nWS:
        It was built by her [neighbor woman] grand father.\nJJ: That\u2019s right.
        Yeah. There was a hotel in the front, well, west of the house called the Mold\nHotel,
        M-O-L-D, and they were the original settlers and original owners of the property
        here, and\nas the hotel came down they built this house. It was the children
        of the person that built the hotel,\nArt and Ida Mold, who built this house
        and had two children [here], and I bought the house from\nthem.\nWS: The family
        name was Mold.\nAW: How do you spell the last name?\nJJ: M-O-L-D. German.\nAW:
        So there was a hotel on this property at one point?\nJJ: Yeah. When we dig
        holes we sometimes see the remains, like out there we can see plaster and\nsand
        from some part of it, somewhere else there are [foundation] rocks. I found
        a big brass key\nand old clay pipes, tobacco pipes. Interesting things coming
        out of the ground.\nAW: Wow, that\u2019s amazing. What was the community like
        then when you moved in? Was there\nsome dairy farmers or--?\nA Measure of

        People had different means of employment. One younger woman, she\u2019s four
        or five years\nyounger than I am, she came over with her newborn baby and
        said \u201cthis is who I am\u201d and\nbasically I got to join their family.
        She had three or four kids and so I had my children surrogates\nthat when
        I went over for dinner they would sit on my lap. We had fun. There was a group
        of\nwomen that invited people to their homes, one place or another every month,
        and we chatted and\ngot to know each other. Eventually that stopped happening
        for one reason or another. So, I felt\nmore of a community locally. It was
        kind of a parallel community to ceramics and pots, which\nwere other people.
        These were the local people that were willing to include me in their activities.\nI\u2019m
        not local, even though I\u2019ve been here since 1975. There\u2019s a distinction
        between if you\u2019re\nborn and raised here from long ago, then you\u2019re
        local. Avery\u2019s been born and raised here but I\ndon\u2019t know if he
        would be considered \u201clocal\u201d, but my neighbors were local and all
        the women\nthat invited me to their houses they all moved in at one time or
        another but they\u2019ve all been here\nsince then. Nobody has moved away.
        Once we got here we stayed. When our son was born in\n1991, we had Janice
        Loger from across the river who was local, born and raised here, come and\ngive
        me a break [by babysitting] so I could work three hours a day after he was
        a year old. She\nwas a grandma to him, which was nice. So it kind of knitted
        us together a little bit more with the\ncommunity. In those earlier years
        of my being here, I could go to North Branch and I would\nknow people on the
        street. Now, there are so many more people, and so many of the people I\nknew
        have gotten old and don\u2019t go to town anymore. It\u2019s much more of
        a generic small town\nthan it used to be, less welcoming in a way because
        the downtown isn\u2019t where everybody goes\nanymore. Now there is a shopping
        mall or people drive twenty or twenty-five miles away to the\nbig box stores.
        You know? It\u2019s all changed.\nAW: Thank you very much for sharing all
        this. It helps us understand how you got to this place\nand the meaning of
        this place to you. Now, when did you meet Will? How did you guys meet?\nJJ:
        One of the regional art fairs I was doing was St. Kate\u2019s or St. Catherine\u2019s
        in St. Paul and\u2014\nWS: The Minnesota Crafts Council.\nJJ: Yeah, put on
        by the Minnesota Crafts Council. And he bought a pot from me, so I had his\nname
        on my mailing list. Then, that fall, he came to the Minnesota Renaissance
        Festival, and\nthere is a side story with that but I don\u2019t need to tell
        that, but he hung around and the cannon\nwent off, which means the gates were
        closing. My mom told him, \u201cwell, you better get to work if\nyou\u2019re
        going to hang around.\u201d (laughs) And put pots away. This was Sunday night.
        That was the\nbeginning of our long life of conversations.\nWS: (Laughs) It
        then became a family joke also, in that her mother would repeat \u201cYou
        better get\nto work and get your pottery made\u201d or \u201cyou better get
        to work and do this\u201d from that initial time\nwhen I met her. Anyway.\nJJ:
        Well we had had a meeting here several years before. He and his first wife
        and two friends\nstopped by early in the spring when the river had just opened
        up. They were canoeing on the\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson
        and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n14\nriver and they stopped here to see the pots.
        That was mentioned and I recalled that, but it wasn\u2019t\nreally where we
        met as far as my memory goes.\nWS: You remember that event and I remember
        the event but I don\u2019t remember if I had ever met\nyou before then or
        if this was the first time I ever laid eyes on you here.\nJJ: Yeah, that I
        don\u2019t remember.\n00:55:05\nWS: I remember seeing your exhibit of pottery
        at the Jewish community center in 1980 or\nsometime.\nJJ: Oh yeah, it was
        carved porcelain then.\nWS: Yeah, that was your first little carvings. I just
        happened to be there.\nJJ: So we met and at that time the telephone between
        here and the city was long distance, so we\nran up our phone bills as we found
        out we enjoyed talking a lot. That was 1984. In 1985 we\ndecided to see how
        it worked to be living together, because I had lived alone for so long. And\nthat
        worked.\nWS: It\u2019s still working pretty well.\nJJ: Yeah. (Laughs) Then
        in 1986 we were married. In 1991 we had a child. I was forty when he\nwas
        born; I didn\u2019t know I could become pregnant, but that\u2019s beside the
        point. It was a real\nwonderful surprise. Now he\u2019s twenty-three.\nAW:
        Where is he now?\nJJ: He\u2019s in Minneapolis. Do you want to know some of
        the interesting part of his story?\nWS: (Laughs)\nAW: Sure!\nJJ: I don\u2019t
        know how far back we need to go, but in college he started out as a biochemistry\nmajor.
        His high school experience his last two years of high school were at the Perpich
        Center\nfor the Arts. He was in theater. On the weekends he took voice and
        musical performance classes\nat MacPhail [Center for Music in Minneapolis].
        In his first semester of his second year at\nEarlham College our family gathered
        on the East coast for Thanksgiving and he and a friend\nwent to see a Broadway
        performance. That kind of hit him right between the eyes, it just like\n\u201cwham!
        I should have been up on the stage.\u201d His desire to be performing again
        came back even\nthough he was doing well with biochemistry. He decided to
        look into and apply to theater\nschools and he got into one he wanted to get
        into but we couldn\u2019t afford the tuition for four more\nyears. So, he
        made a very difficult personal decision and called us a couple weeks after
        our\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n15\nsaying,
        \u201cwe can\u2019t do it but you can if you want to\u201d and decided to
        be an art major with ceramics\nas his focus. It surprised us. We had no idea
        that he had that kind of interest.\nWS: Well, he had always been so involved
        in the arts and music and theater that he hadn\u2019t paid\nmuch attention
        to my making pottery, for example. He would help me recycle clay and do some\ntasks,
        usually when I\u2019d pay him, (laughs) but he was paying attention. He understood
        our life in\nthe arts, which was what he was looking for.\nJJ: And he helped
        sell at the pottery tour and he was involved with that, but he hadn\u2019t
        really\nmade pots then. So he asked, \u201cwould you teach me how to make
        pots when I come home?\u201d He\nwas already committed; the ceramics teacher
        was his advisor.\nWS: The end of his sophomore year that was.\nJJ: The end
        of his sophomore year he came home and learned how to make pots. He \u201cgot
        it\u201d in\nthe time period that would indicate whether or not it would succeed.
        I tried teaching the steps and\nhe kind of brushed that off as soon as he
        figured out how he could move forward on his own. So,\nI did what I could
        to encourage him and tell him where things could get better and maybe a little\nbit
        on how to get around the problems he was having. By the end of the summer
        he made some\nfairly decent pots for having worked six or seven weeks.\nWS:
        Then he went back to college and took over the job of student assistant in
        the shop and\nhelping to be kind of a student teaching assistant. For his
        junior and senior year he was sort of\nthe big dog in the ceramics department,
        it sounds like, at this small college.\nJJ: Yeah, for two years. Then he graduated
        in\u2014\nAW: Which college was this?\nJJ: Earlham. E-A-R-L-H-A-M. He graduated
        last year, in July 2013.\nWS: It\u2019s in Indiana.\nJJ: Then he committed
        to being a mutual apprentice with Sam Taylor and Mark Shapiro\u2014\nWS: Who
        are potters in Massachusetts.\nJJ: They are also guests on our tour [St. Croix
        Pottery Tour]. So he spent a year in Massachusetts\nworking with them part-time
        and having to have a job part-time.\n01:00:15\nWS: He\u2019s now back in Minnesota,
        having just moved back.\nJJ: He worked at a co-op grocery store that had a
        deli counter that also had a bakery. He trained\nin with the baker and started
        taking over baking duties and\u2014\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n16\nWS: Because his pottery apprenticeship
        was unpaid, so he needed a job. So he worked at this\nbakery place.\nJJ: By
        the end of his year he said, \u201cI want to be a baker.\u201d (Laughs) So
        he found a job in\nMinneapolis and he\u2019s very happy.\nAW: Can I ask which
        bakery?\nJJ: Sun Street Breads on 46th and Nicollet. He\u2019s the tall slender
        young man working there, right\nnow, in the summer, Sunday through Thursday,
        if you happen to go in before ten.\nWS: Well, he goes in at either two or
        four in the morning.\nJJ: Yeah, and he\u2019s out by ten or noon. Nice guy.
        They like him and he likes them. I\u2019m very\nhappy for him.\nWS: And in
        a way it\u2019s very much like making pottery; making bread. Making pastries
        and stuff.\nJJ: Except you make your product and you sell it all in the same
        day and you make people happy.\nYou can see them being happy. With pots, you
        have to wait weeks and months to get that done.\nIt\u2019s a very long process
        and very complex in getting it all balanced and still try and make a living\nwith
        it. It suits him, I think, very well. He\u2019s happy and he has prospect
        for growth.\nAW: Well that\u2019s exciting to see his interest in ceramics.
        His interest in biochemistry is also part\nof pottery too, right? You\u2019re
        seeing how the glazes work and the chemistry that is going on there.\nJJ:
        Yeah, and I think knowing both of those, understanding both biochemistry and
        making pots,\nhe\u2019s a maker. All things rely on chemical reactions and
        I think it will all inform him throughout\nhis life. What he has learned so
        far.\nTM: I wish I had the patience for biochemistry. Not my forte. (Laughs)\nJJ:
        It was fun when he talked about things in his pre-pottery days. The enthusiasm
        he had from\nthe [science] classes he was learning from. It was very much
        surprising that he changed his mind.\nYou never know.\nAW: You never know.
        You find a career that brings them all together or maybe this is what\nbaking
        does for him.\nWS: He went, in his junior year of high school, he went to
        the Perpich Center for the Arts and\nlived in the Twin Cities. It was a residential
        [school] with kids from all over the state of\nMinnesota. So it was coming
        to an arts high school and starting over. You know, leaving all the\nkids
        you were with from kindergarten through tenth grade behind and meeting all
        these kids who\nwere artists and musicians and starting over with them. I
        think that had a big influence on what\nhe wants to do for the rest of his
        life. He wants to be involved in creating things. So, anyway\u2014\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n17\nAW:
        That\u2019s great. Maybe one day someone will do an oral history with him
        about a career in\nceramics. Who knows?\nAW: Well Will, if we could spend
        a little bit of time on you now. If you could give us a little\noverview of
        when you were born and where did you grow up?\nWS: Boy, I\u2019ve been very
        patient at listening. It\u2019s hard not to jump in and want to comment. Well\nlet\u2019s
        see. I was born in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1947. My parents at the time lived
        in St.\nCharles, Minnesota, a small town. My father was teaching what was
        called \u201cVeterans Ag\u201d,\nwhich was, people coming back from World
        War II could take classes under the G.I. Bill, he was\nteaching agriculture
        classes because he had a degree in agriculture.\n01:04:48\nAW: What was his
        name?\nWS: His name was Ray, Raymond Swanson.\nBut, shortly after I was born,
        he had an opportunity to move to Marshall, Minnesota, out on the\nprairie
        in western Minnesota. Someone that he had met years before who admired his
        managerial\nabilities took him on as a partner in a hardware store. Up until
        I was nine, or eight and a half\nyears old, we lived in Marshall, Minnesota.
        My father was the manager and partner of the Smith\nand Swanson Hardware Store.
        It was great; I used to, after kindergarten each day, go and hang\nout at
        the hardware store, which I liked a lot. This was in Marshall, Minnesota.
        Then my father\nwho had grown up on a farm, both my parents grew up on farms
        and much of our family culture\nhad to do with their being from the farm.
        They never really saw themselves as \u2018town folks\u2019 so\nmuch as folks
        who had moved in from the farm.\nMy father went to work, after the hardware
        store, for something called the Federal Land Bank,\nwhich is now called Farm
        Credit Services. It\u2019s a cooperative lending institution that lends money\nto
        farmers to buy land. Mostly it\u2019s land, I think, huge amounts of money
        to buy your neighbors\nfarm or that kind of thing. My father really liked
        working with people and was really smart. He\nwas hired to do this out in
        Marshall, Minnesota, and when he was promoted he was given the\nmanager-ship
        of another office in Glencoe, Minnesota, which is then where I lived from
        the time\nI was in third grade all the way through high school. Glencoe, Minnesota,
        is just an hour\nsouthwest of the Twin Cities. It\u2019s in really rich farm
        country, kind of the beginning of the prairie\nin Minnesota. My father was
        there through a time when farming was really thriving and land\nvalues were
        rising. Farmers were doing well. He took great pride in never having to foreclose
        on\nanyone. I think he was a very well respected person in those several counties
        that he worked in.\nSo he was a manager. Shortly after we moved there we rented
        a house and then we had to move\nfrom that house because somebody wanted to
        live there and we had to find another place to live.\nMy father rented a farmhouse
        that sat three miles out of town next to a barn, a granary and a\nchicken
        coop. The farmer who owned it also owned the farm next door and lived next
        door, so\nwe lived on this farmstead. In a sense I got to grow up in this
        rural farmstead with a big grove of\ntrees out behind, a pond, and a meadow;
        all these places to wonder around and go out and hunt\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n18\npheasants after
        school and things like that. So I had this kind of unique upbringing in that
        I lived\nin the country and wandered around in the woods a lot. This is part
        of how I kind of ended up\nmoving out of the city years later, because I didn\u2019t
        want to live the rest of my life in the city. So\nthat [growing up in the
        country] had some influence on where I wanted to land years later. My\nparents
        had both grown up on farms so they were very comfortable being out on this
        homestead.\nFor me it was a chance to wander around in nature a lot. We raised
        some chickens and the farmer\nnext door raised pigs. We would feed table scraps
        to the pigs and play in the barn, which was full\nof hay. My younger brother
        and I, we weren\u2019t supposed to, but we would move the bales around\nand
        build forts. We kind of got to play on the farm without having a lot of the
        responsibilities of\nthe farm. We didn\u2019t have chores to do on the farm.
        Anyway, that was a wonderful place to grow\nup. I think I was lucky to have
        had that.\n01:10:00\nAW: What was your mother\u2019s name?\nWS: My mother\u2019s
        name is Mae. M-A-E. Mae Thurston Swanson.\nAW: And you said you have a brother?\nWS:
        Well I have two brothers. I was one of three boys. I have a brother who is
        five and a half\nyears older, who was a senior in high school when I was in
        seventh grade, and I have a brother\nwho is two and a half years younger and
        was three years behind me in school. So my younger\nbrother and I were much
        closer than my older brother and I. My younger brother, unfortunately,\npassed
        away when he was twenty-two years old. So for most of my adult life it\u2019s
        been my older\nbrother and I, the remaining family. But my younger brother
        and I enjoyed being out there on the\nfarmstead.\nWe went to school in Glencoe,
        Minnesota, and I graduated from high school in Glencoe,\nMinnesota. It was
        a town of about two thousand people, a farming community that was very\nmuch,
        almost entirely a separate small community. There were very few people who
        drove the\nsixty miles from there to Minneapolis to work. Not very many; this
        was I the 1960s. Growing up\nthere as a child you kind of learned where people
        fit, you know, who were the Lutherans, who\nwere the Catholics, who were the
        farmers, who were the townies. There were all these kind of\ndivisions, which
        were both positive and negative, just like any small town. But it had enormous\npossibilities
        for things that I got involved in like athletics and music. I could do as
        much as my\nabilities allowed me to do and I got involved in all kinds of
        things.\nAW: Like what? What are some of the athletics or musical things you
        got involved in?\nWS: Well, from the time I was a little boy I used to ride
        my bike the three miles into town to\nplay little league baseball every day.
        Back then we had these wonderful little league teams that\nwould play against
        every little small town all around. We\u2019d get on a school bus and ride
        away for\nthe day out to Buffalo Lake, Minnesota, or Hutchinson, Minnesota,
        or somewhere. We had\nwoolen uniforms, you know, it was really organized.
        So we played baseball all summer. But\nthat\u2019s little kids stuff. Athletics
        are big in small town Minnesota. It\u2019s a lot to do with the identity\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n19\nof
        the town. I think every boy who could would want to be on the team, so I wanted
        to be on the\nbaseball team and the football team; I did all those things
        up to my ability. I ended up doing\nsome of them rather well and some not
        as well, like when I discovered everyone was a foot taller\nthan me on the
        basketball team. Then I went out for wrestling (laughs). Anyway, there were
        lots\nof other opportunities to be involved in school through student government
        and the yearbook and\nall that kind of stuff. I did a lot of music; I was
        always a singer and I played in the band.\nAW: What did you play?\n01:13:48\nWS:
        I played the trumpet, but I wasn\u2019t a great musician, I was a better singer.
        I wasn\u2019t like Janel\nwho really excelled. She was a saxophone player
        and continued to play in college in the college\nband. She still plays today.
        I sang a lot all through school, all through college and with other\ngroups
        after college, like the Minnesota Choral with the Minnesota Orchestra and
        things like\nthat. So music was always important and something that I was
        good at and got recognition for.\nI graduated from high school in Glencoe
        in 1965. That was a long time ago (laughs)! The next\nyear I went to Gustavus
        Adolphus for college, where I sang in the choir and thought I would\nbecome
        a Lutheran minister, because I really respected the ministers in my small
        town. So I was\na philosophy major until I kind of decided I wasn\u2019t really
        a believer like all these other Lutheran\nbelievers were and I wanted to be
        somewhere bigger. After two years at Gustavus I went to the\nUniversity of
        Minnesota and changed my major to humanities.\nNow that\u2019s a very confusing
        time and I\u2019m not sure that I should go into all the details, but this\nwas
        during the Vietnam War. The draft was coming up so that everyone who was in
        school, well,\nyou were either in school making full time progress or you\u2019d
        get drafted and sent to Vietnam. So\nthere was always that pressure going
        on. Actually, what I wanted to do was join VISTA or the\nPeace Corps. Which
        I could have because I had been accepted into VISTA, Volunteers in\nService
        to America, but they told me as soon as I finish my year in VISTA I would
        be drafted\nbecause then I would be a year behind in school. My school progress
        would be a year behind. So\nI turned that down and went back to school at
        the University. I kind of floundered around not\nknowing exactly what to major
        in and what to do. I was very socially involved in doing music\nand performance
        at the University. I sang in the University Chamber Singers, which is this
        really\ngood group, a small group of select singers.\nAnyway, I had applied
        to my draft board to be recognized as a conscientious objector to the\nVietnam
        War, which they turned me down and then there was an appeal to the State Board.\nEventually
        I ended up actually being designated as a conscientious objector after I had\nvolunteered
        for the draft, which is like volunteering for national service, but only as
        a\nconscientious objector. I was refusing to be in the military. So at that
        time I actually found a job\nfor myself, and the draft board assigned me to
        work at this job for two years. I was assigned by\nthe draft board to work
        alternate service to the draft, as it was called, for two years at Fairview\nHospital
        in Minneapolis as an orderly. And eventually, after a short time, they had
        actually hired\nme to work in the psychiatric ward. So I began working in
        the psychiatric ward in 1969 at\nFairview and worked there full time, well
        supposedly full-time for two years I had to work there\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n20\nas assigned by
        the draft board, which I did. I ended up working there until, at least part-time,\nuntil
        1985 (laughs), so I was there for fifteen or sixteen years, parts of those
        years. In between I\nwent back to school and finished a degree in social work
        and continued to work full-time helping\nto develop programs at Fairview Hospital
        having to do with adolescent psychiatry. We had short-term\ntreatment programs
        and crisis evaluation programs. For many years I worked in the crisis\nunit
        where we would evaluate kids coming in for other placement. Anyway, so I mostly
        worked\nwith adolescents in the psychiatric ward. But then I went back to
        school and finished my degree\nin social work\/social welfare. Then I started
        taking classes in the evening, pottery classes and\nsculpture classes and
        drawing classes. At some point I decided I was going to pursue art and not\nsocial
        work or psychology. That was the big decision that I made.\nAW: Why did you
        decide that?\nWS: The basic reason, I had already spent ten to twelve years
        working with people who were\npretty miserable, people who were anxious, psychotic,
        out of touch with reality. My coworkers\nwere great, you know, it was really
        a challenge to commiserate with your coworkers to try to\nfigure out how to
        help these people- all the way from psychiatrists to psychiatric nurses to
        other\npsychiatric technicians, which was my classification. I decided I didn\u2019t
        want to spend the rest of\nmy life working with people who were so miserable.
        I wasn\u2019t really burnt out so much as I was\nmaking the decision to move
        on to something else. And along the way that had been kind of\nnudged by liking
        the sculpture classes and the pottery classes; things I had taken at the U\n[University
        of Minnesota] in evening school or Saturday school or whenever I was doing
        it.\nThen at some point I thought, well I should get a degree in art if I\u2019m
        going to do something else.\nAt one point I thought maybe I would get a degree
        in landscape architecture. I realized I was\nyears behind in architecture
        and couldn\u2019t really catch up--. Anyway, it was suggested to me that I\ngo
        to the design department in St. Paul and take some design classes and see
        how I liked that.\nThen I could show the architecture department that I had
        this experience in design. So I went to\nthe St. Paul campus at the University
        of Minnesota and the design department, which is\ntraditionally in the College
        of Home Economics, which meant most of the students were women.\nMost of them
        were studying interior decorating or fabric design or fashion design, but
        I enjoyed\nthe classes. The classes were a straightforward two-dimensional
        design, color, three-dimensional\ndesign; very straightforward just conceptual
        design ideas and I really liked it. This was what\nreinforced my sense that
        I could do something in the aesthetic realm. You know, the way things\nlook
        to us and how we appreciate objects and things could be important. That the
        basic social\nand human values that we all share by enjoying dinner around
        the table together, or whatever, the\nthings that go into making that work
        could.\nThis fellow in the design department [Eugene Larkin] really encouraged
        me. I took the whole\nsequence of undergraduate design classes in the design
        department. I took drawing, two-dimensional\ndesign, color, three-dimensional
        design and surface fabric design, we did weaving,\nwe did surface fabric printing,
        a lot of traditional craft things. And then, he said, why don\u2019t you\napply
        to graduate school? So I did. I got in and ended up doing a graduate degree
        at the\nUniversity of Minnesota in the design department. I got to be a TA
        and I taught the three-dimensional\ndesign class while I was there. At the
        same time I got to take, I did what was called\na graduate minor, in the studio
        arts department over on the Minneapolis campus, which is\nA Measure of the
        Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n21\nceramics
        and sculpture. Which is what I knew I was really interested in (laughs). Maybe
        I would\nmake pottery someday.\nSomewhere along the line there I had run into,
        well probably ten years before, I had run into\nWarren MacKenzie and his pottery,
        and Jeff Oestreich and his pottery, before I even knew Janel.\nI admired what
        they were doing.\n01:23:50\nAW: What was it about ceramics that you knew that
        this was something you really wanted?\nWS: I think, for me, the physicality
        of it. I like working with clay. I like that the process was so\nfascinating.
        The fire was interesting. You know there is this whole world of ceramics that
        is so\nhuge you could pick your own section and work in it. I think I had
        great admiration at the time\nfor people who had worked with Warren, in particular,
        Mark Pharis and Wayne Branum, two of\nhis students who are the same age as
        I am virtually, but they were working with him when they\nwere young students
        at the University [of Minnesota]. I was coming along ten years later. But\nthey
        had made a lot of handsome pots over the years, which I enjoyed seeing. I
        had bought a lot\nof pots over the years, I wasn\u2019t a big collector; I
        would just buy some things to use, but I enjoyed\nusing them and sharing them
        with other people.\nYou asked me what it was about ceramics, part of it was
        the idea of working for yourself and\npart of it, as much as I don\u2019t
        really like to admit it, was kind of a lifestyle choice. I want to\ndecide
        what I want to do and I want to be in charge of the creative part of it. I
        don\u2019t want my life\nto be under the thumb of some institution or organization
        or managerial system where I\u2019m not\nallowed to do what I want to do or
        I\u2019m just working for someone else. I kind of discourage\npeople some
        days when I say this isn\u2019t just a lifestyle choice, you know, you really
        have to care\nabout those pieces of pottery (laughs). But it was somewhat
        for me certainly. Just as Janel talks\nabout how wonderful it is to be out
        here in the country every day, I feel the same way every time\nI walk from
        here to the workshop. I feel that I\u2019m lucky to be here and it was a great
        choice.\nJJ: It\u2019s a lot of work to maintain it. When all your lawn mowers
        aren\u2019t working\u2014(laughs)\nWS: (Laughs) Yeah, like right now.\nJJ:
        You take out the scythe. There are just ways around it. There is some responsibility
        to making\nit a lovely place to be.\nWS: I think personally for me, the choice
        of ceramics, was tied up a little bit in the force of the\nmilitary decision
        that was put onto me when I was eighteen or nineteen years old. You know,
        are\nyou going to go to Vietnam, are you going to join the Army? From you
        have to you don\u2019t have\nany choice, to, kind of saying, no, I\u2019m
        going to do this with my life. That was always a powerful\ninfluence and I
        was going to do something humane, something with human, intimate, aesthetic\nvalue.
        In fact, when I first met Warren MacKenzie and saw what he was doing, it wasn\u2019t
        his skill\nat making pots that impressed me, it was his looking at this object
        and thinking, boy, this is\nreally nice, you know, I could have this in my
        life. You could take it and use it; it could be a\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n22\nvaluable thing
        to you. It was kind of a non-masculine thing that he was doing that was okay.\nGrowing
        up like I did in kind of a sexist mid-twentieth century environment, women
        had certain\nroles and men had certain roles. Men sitting around looking at
        pottery was not something I\nexpected, but it was always something I had kind
        of done. My mother and I always enjoyed\nmaking things look nice. She always
        said she had three boys, so I got to be her helper, because I\nwas the one
        who cared about setting the table and stuff like that. So I was always tuned
        into the\nway things looked.\nWS: Anyway, when I saw Warren paying attention
        to how things were made and how they\nlooked and how they could be important
        to people, that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I didn\u2019t want to be\nWarren
        MacKenzie; I didn\u2019t want to necessarily be a teacher or make the pots
        that he was\nmaking but the fact that he was equating it and here he was in
        the University [of Minnesota]\nclassroom and right down the hall was painting
        and sculpture. Well, maybe ceramics is important\ntoo if it is here, you know.
        So it seemed viable to me and it seemed physical and it seemed close\nat hand.
        It seemed like something I could kind of wrap my hands around.\nAW: It seems
        like it was a very moving time for you. It was interesting, because Bob was\nreflecting
        on too the time period, that the Vietnam War was going on and that influenced
        part of\nhis decision to not participate in that and part of protesting the
        Vietnam War was pursuing this\nlifestyle. It seems there might be some parallels.\nWS:
        Yeah, we\u2019ve talked about that.\nAW: What were some of the pressure, if
        I could ask? Because I imagine all over the country,\nparticularly in small
        towns, the pressure might have been more intensive?\n01:29:35\nWS: In small
        town Minnesota, my local draft board, for example, was made up of three or
        four\nguys that were all recruited from the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization.
        So they were all\nveterans, they\u2019d all been in the army and they just
        kind of rubber stamped things. At the time I\nwas working part-time as a draft
        counselor helping people figure out what to do with their draft\nboard, how
        to apply to the draft board for this, that and the other. So I in a sense
        knew the\nregulations better than these guys did. Anyway, I shouldn\u2019t
        go on about that, but every selective\nservice board had a secretary, a county
        secretary, and she would be the one who really ran the\nboard. She would tell
        the men what to do and they would kind of rubberstamp it, that\u2019s the
        way it\nseemed to me. At first they turned me down and said, \u201cno you
        can\u2019t do this\u201d and \u201cno one has\never done this in our district
        before since World War II\u201d. Anyway, it was a very specific\nsituation
        in that there was someone else doing it at the same time who was a friend
        of mine. He\nended up being one of the \u201cMinnesota Eight\u201d, which
        was this group of people that broke into the\ndraft boards and eventually
        ended up going to federal prison. One of these young men was a\nfriend of
        mine and he was involved in some other things going on.\nWhat happened was
        the state board sent down some overseers to watch the next meeting, and the\nnext
        meeting happened to be when I was having this review of my conscientious objector
        status.\nSo, the draft board was really on their best behavior and I did this
        political thing, I went around\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n23\nand--I was fairly well known around
        town as a responsible young person who was involved in\nlots of things\u2014so
        I went around and I had this character reference thing. All the ministers
        in\ntown and the principal of the school and some other upright citizens in
        town, doctors and\nlawyers, signed this thing saying, \u201cwe don\u2019t
        agree with this young man but we think he is\nsincere.\u201d So then I presented
        this thing to them [draft board] and they were looking not just at me\nbut
        they were looking at this list of all these names of upstanding people in
        town who said, \u201cwe\nbelieve this kid.\u201d At the time I was thinking
        and probably saying that I was going into the\nministry, the Lutheran ministry.
        So they were looking at me as more of a traditional religious\nguy, although,
        Lutheranism didn\u2019t fit with pacifism. At any rate, I was intense about
        it and they\neventually said, \u201cokay, just go do it.\u201d I said, \u201cIf
        you give me this, I\u2019ll do two years of alternate\nservice.\u201d Which
        is like volunteering for the draft, so then they said okay. It was embarrassing
        in\na way because there were lots of kids who didn\u2019t know the law, who
        didn\u2019t know how to do this,\nand just got swept up and went off to Vietnam
        and got maimed or killed. So I feel a bit of\nsurvivor\u2019s guilt for having
        manipulated the system, and I feel a little more smart for having done\nit
        and taken a stand. And boy this doesn\u2019t have much to do with pottery,
        except that it helped me\ndecide that I was going to do something that had
        to do with human values that I thought were\nimportant. And that\u2019s maybe
        what goes into pottery.\nAW: Well it sounds like it. You were just kind of
        describing that that was such a huge moment\nfor you, realizing what you weren\u2019t
        willing to do and what you wanted to see for your life and\ncareer.\nWS: Yeah,
        I guess we all make decisions in one way or another. For me part of it was
        I\u2019m not\ngoing to do this, I\u2019m going to do this. It was a definite
        choice.\nAW: And at such a young age too I think.\nWS: At the same time my
        brother died. [Emotional] And I had this feeling that I could just do\nwhatever,
        what the hell if life is not that long. Just do whatever you want.\nAW: You
        guys must have been very close. What was his name?\nJJ: Eldon. He was younger.\nWS:
        Yeah, he was a couple years younger than I was. He was twenty-two and I was
        twenty-four\nwhen he died. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just too much emotion.
        He had testicular cancer. He was diagnosed\nand died six months later. It
        was just a freakish sort of thing.\n01:35:00\nAW: Wow, he was so young.\nJJ:
        Yeah.\nWS: Anyway, I\u2019m sorry I got lost in the emotion there and you
        can kind of remind me where I\u2019m\nat I guess.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n24\nAW: Well, you
        were kind of talking about going to graduate school and pursuing a graduate\nminor
        in ceramics\u2014\nWS: Oh yeah. So I did some work in ceramics. I took one
        class from Warren MacKenzie, which\nhe didn\u2019t remember for a long time
        that I was actually a student in his class, but he certainly had\nan influence
        on me. Just seeing him working in the studio and going out to his studio and
        buying\npots from him over the years. And seeing other people try to make
        a living making pots, that\nseemed like something I would really like to do.
        I learned from other people in the studio arts\ndepartment too, there was
        Curtis Hoard, who taught me how to throw pots on the wheel, and\nTom Lane,
        he and I built a salt kiln together. Well, I was in a salt kiln building class,
        although\nthere were only a couple of us who did much of the work. But there
        were good guides at glaze\nmaking and pottery making, critical evaluation
        of your work and learning how to work. After\nschool then, two or three years,
        I think I graduated and got my master\u2019s degree in eighty-one and\nI met
        Janel in eighty-four. I forget when the degree was actually granted. At that
        point I was still\nworking in the city and making pots part-time as a hobby
        not having anywhere to fire them.\nActually I continued to work at Fairview
        Hospital in the psych ward until 1985, where I was\ndoing something called
        the Wilderness Treatment Program, where I used to take kids to the\nBoundary
        Waters, which was the final project I worked on there.\nAW: What was that
        like? You were describing most of your childhood and young adulthood was\nin
        rural areas and farming areas, and then to go to Gustavus and then to move
        to the U of M,\nwhich is a pretty big campus. What was that like for you to
        make that transition?\nWS: After I\u2019d been at Gustavus for two years,
        it wasn\u2019t like coming there as a freshman, which\nwould have been quite
        overwhelming. I think I was more ready for it after spending two years in\na
        small town. Gustavus was just thirty-five miles from my hometown, at St. Peter.
        When I came\nto the University [of Minnesota] then I had been in college,
        I had learned how to do college work\nand I was involved in doing music in
        college. I kind of fit right into the University music\nprogram doing a lot
        of singing. And I really got sucked into big university intramural athletics.
        I\nused to play softball and football, racquetball and handball and ping pong
        (laughs)\u2014we had all\nthese intermural athletic things, which I loved
        doing athletic stuff but in a sense I did too much.\nIt was hard for me to
        do everything and then do music. I belonged to a fraternity because I had
        a\nhigh school friend who was in a fraternity and he recruited me to come
        and be in the fraternity\nand perform in these things they would put on at
        school, these campus carnival events, musical\nevents. We would create musicals
        from whole cloth, and put them on, perform them and try to\nwin awards. It
        happened that I joined this fraternity that won the first prize award year
        after year\nafter year so we had this tradition to hold up. So he recruited
        me to be a singer in this stuff, so I\ndid that. There was a lot of distraction.
        My grades were okay but I wasn\u2019t achieving much\nacademically, I was
        kind of floundering around staying in school so I wouldn\u2019t get drafted.
        That\nwas part of it. I ended up taking many, many classes in different fields,
        history, sociology,\npsychology; I just about have a psychology major. All
        because I wanted to continue to be a full-time\nstudent.\nAW: So, were you
        selling your pottery during that time before you met Janel?\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n25\nWS:
        I wasn\u2019t. I made pots as a student. I did have a part-time job at a furniture
        store where we\nbuilt unpainted furniture and a couple of times I had pottery
        from my classes and I brought them\nin and put them on the shelves and they
        all disappeared within a week. So I knew that people\nliked them and that
        they could be sold.\nJJ: I don\u2019t know that I knew that.\n01:40:30\nAW:
        So you weren\u2019t selling them, you were just putting them up?\nWS: No,
        I put them up for sale. I put them up and the family who owned the business
        said, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t we put them for sale?\u201d So I did. I remember
        one of the first days somebody came in, some\nyoung fellow who had just opened
        a new office or something, and he bought almost all of them\nto decorate his
        office with or something. That was pretty reinforcing to me. I mean they were\nnice
        simple pots, but anyway, that was a long time ago.\nI think at that point
        I had bought a kit and built my own potter\u2019s wheel that I had in my basement\nin
        Minneapolis, but I didn\u2019t have any place to fire the pottery so I was
        continuing to take some\nclasses over at the University [of Minnesota] so
        I would have a place to fire pottery.\nAW: Where did you live in Minneapolis?\nWS:
        I lived in the Seward neighborhood the last few years I lived there, which
        is close to the\nUniversity. Ironically, one block away from the Northern
        Clay Center. Where the Northern Clay\nCenter is right now. It wasn\u2019t
        there at that time.\nAW: What was the ceramics, you described some of the
        people at the University of Minnesota,\nbut what was the ceramics community
        like then?\nWS: I think it was new. It seemed like I don\u2019t know, as compared
        to what it is like today? It\nseemed then like it was a world of possibilities.
        You could define your own work and go to the\nlocal art fair and sell some
        things and maybe try and make a living. There were more art fairs\nthat seemed
        newer and fresher than there are today.\nAW: Did you go to those and ever
        sell there? Or did you go just to attend?\nWS: I didn\u2019t get into trying
        to sell to make a living really until I moved up here. I still had my\njob
        working in the hospital. Janel had been involved in going to Duluth to the
        Park Point Show\nand going to sell in St. Paul and, um\u2014\nJJ: St. Cloud.\nWS:
        St. Cloud and small art fairs all around. She never drew a paycheck; she always
        made a\nliving from her pottery. Then once I decided to try making a living
        we continued at the\nRenaissance Fair for a few years. I kind of added on
        to what she was doing and that helped me\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n26\nlearn how to make pots to sell, actually,
        because I\u2019d make a lot of little dumpy coffee mugs and\ntake them there
        and sell them for four dollars or two fifty I think they were at first\u2014\nJJ:
        Two seventy-five (or) four fifty, but not anymore!\nWS: Because the Renaissance
        Festival started as a craft fair, not the entertainment event it is\ntoday.
        It was a craft fair; that is what it was all about when it started. Now it\u2019s
        a themed family\nevent kind of.\nJJ: Themed entertainment event.\nWS: Yeah.\nAW:
        So now there are a couple members of the [St. Croix Pottery] Tour, who were
        also at the\nRenaissance Fair. Did you meet other people there?\nWS: Well,
        Rick [Richard] Vincent was out there, that\u2019s how we met him. And that\u2019s
        how we\nended up kind of recruiting him to be part of the Tour, because we
        already knew him and he had\njust moved here, actually, from farther down
        in the cities.\nJJ: Yeah, I don\u2019t know his early story.\nWS: Yeah, he
        was at the Renaissance Fair.\nAW: Were there others?\nWS: No, not in this
        group.\nAW: So after you guys met, when did you decide to move here?\nWS:
        Um, well I moved here in 1985.\nJJ: We took a road trip in my Datsun pickup\u2014\nWS:
        To visit your dad in Arizona.\nJJ: Yeah, to see if we could be in a confined
        space (laughs) together all the time, and it worked\nout just fine.\n01:45:00\nWS:
        Was that in the spring of eighty-five? Before I moved in?\nJJ: Yeah, it was
        March of eighty-five. You moved in in warmer weather I think.\nA Measure of
        the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n27\nWS:
        And then in eighty-five I dropped my job. This grant I had to run this Wilderness
        Treatment\nProgram ran out and my job ended and I stopped getting a paycheck
        and started making pottery\nfor a living. Which always felt like an enormous
        risk after you were used to getting a paycheck\nall the time.\nJJ: Oh yeah.
        It still is a risk.\nWS: So we haven\u2019t had a paycheck for, what, almost
        thirty years now.\nJJ: Um-hm.\nWS: So then actually I started doing local
        craft fairs. The big one was the Minnesota Crafts\nCouncil show at St. Catherine\u2019s
        [University] in the summertime. We refer to it as St. Kate\u2019s.\nEverybody
        calls it the St. Kate\u2019s Art Fair, but it was the Minnesota Crafts Council,
        which was a\ngroup of craftspeople from around Minnesota that ran the show.
        Janel was part of the\n[Minnesota] Crafts Council, she was vice-president
        at one point. This was a group that was\nstarted years before by maybe Warren
        and someone else\u2014\nJJ: Yeah, I remember sitting in on early meetings
        when they were brainstorming about it.\nWS: And then I was part of it and
        I think it might be where Bob and I actually met, but I\u2019m not\nsure.
        Bob Briscoe and I were at an annual meeting of the Crafts Council when, maybe,
        he first\nmentioned that he might move up here. I don\u2019t remember exactly
        it\u2019s gotten to be too long ago.\nBut we were aware of each other because
        we had pottery on consignment at a couple of shops in\nMinneapolis and we
        might run into each other when we were delivering pottery or something.\nSo,
        um, let\u2019s see\u2014\nAW: Tell us a little bit about the Minnesota Crafts
        Council, how that got started.\nWS: The Crafts Council was a lively group
        and they ran the St. Catherine Art Fair for years. This\nis from the seventies
        on. Or did it start in the sixties? [Turns to Janel] You were involved in
        it\nwhen I met you\u2014\nJJ: Yeah, I don\u2019t remember exactly how it got
        started either, but I did become involved early.\nThere was a different organization
        called the Midwest Artists\u2019 Guild that started organizing a\ncraft fair
        that took place at Mears Park for a few years. And then I think that that
        event became\nthe St. Kate\u2019s Art Fair, or in my mind, I went to one and
        that ended then I went to the other.\nSomehow there was a time relationship
        between them and artists moved from one to the other\nand artists were part
        of the group that ran and orchestrated those events. Otherwise, I can\u2019t\nremember
        the exact beginnings; I was pretty young then.\nWS: By the time I got to it,
        the St. Kate\u2019s Art Fair was the best art fair in Minnesota. We\nconsidered
        it better than the Uptown Art Fair in terms that it was the best quality craft
        show. The\nUptown Art Fair was this big gargantuan thing that would let anybody
        in\u2014\nJJ: It was also limited to craftsmen and not photography or painting.\nA
        Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n28\nWS:
        Right. It wasn\u2019t fine art it was craft materials. We ran that for years.
        I helped run it for a few\nyears and then the [Minnesota] Crafts Council kind
        of disbanded. Most of us grew older and\ndidn\u2019t participate in the administration
        of it anymore. Anyway, that was the best show going in\nMinnesota. Then, actually,
        when we stopped doing the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in 1992,\nJanel had
        already started reaching out to some of the better craft shows in America.
        The\nAmerican Craft Council shows\u2014\nJJ: The Philadelphia Museum of Art
        Craft Show, The Smithsonian Craft Show and some other\nkinds of things.\nWS:
        You had started doing those in the eighties\u2014\nJJ: With carved porcelain.
        And did those quite regularly.\nWS: Then I started applying to some of those,
        like Philadelphia, I first did it in the early nineties\nand have done it
        sixteen times since or something. Janel\u2019s been at the Smithsonian Craft
        Show\nmany times\u2014\nJJ: Ten times I think.\nWS: Yeah, I don\u2019t know.
        These are kind of the most selective craft shows in America. It\u2019s\nenabled
        us to build our audience nationally. Which hasn\u2019t hurt the pottery tour
        either because we\nspread the word about the pottery tour around the country.\n01:50:20\nAW:
        if I could follow up. I asked you a little bit about why you chose ceramics,
        but if you could\ndescribe your approach to ceramics and how you define your
        approach and style.\nWS: I think part of it is that my approach is around
        what I want to do. I want to make small\ngroups of pots; I don\u2019t want
        to make one hundred of something, I want to make ten or twelve of\nsomething.\nJJ:
        That\u2019s a point of departure between us.\nWS: Yeah, Janel will always
        say, \u201cmake forty of those while you\u2019re doing it\u201d. Because that\u2019s\nwhat
        she used to do at the Renaissance Fair. Make forty wine goblets.\nJJ: Or a
        hundred (laughs).\nWS: So, anyway, my pots are of fairly simple design. They
        are straightforward. If anything I\u2019ll\nsimplify a form rather than decorate
        it. I don\u2019t decorate the pots other than the way the glaze\nflows over
        the pot or the way the wood ash will lay on the pot. I might sprinkle something
        on the\npot. Or the way the atmosphere in the kiln affects the pot. You might
        get some smoky carbon\ntrapping going on over on the edges, which is different
        from the other sides. So it\u2019s very subtle.\nThe kind of pots I like to
        make are often called \u201cquiet pots\u201d in that they\u2019re not decorated
        or they\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n29\nmight
        be decorated by the process. They might still have my finger prints on them
        so that people\ncan see that they are handmade. But I do spend more time trimming
        them sometimes. Most\npotters will look at them and say, \u201cthese are tighter
        pots\u201d because I\u2019ve spent more time paring\ndown the bottom so that
        the weight of the pot is a little bit lighter. I might have spent more time\nthrowing
        them to get a nice smooth surface on the top. I want them to be useful; I
        want people to\nenjoy using them and not be annoyed by them because the surface
        is rough or the edge is\ncracking off or they\u2019re so heavy that you can\u2019t
        lift them in and out of the cupboard. I want them\nto fit in the dishwasher.
        I want them to be enjoyable for people to use every day. I guess ideally I\nwant
        people to reach in the cupboard and pick out the ones that I made because
        they know they\nlike using them, you know? They\u2019ve gotten used to them.
        Not that I want them to be boring. I\ncould sometimes do more to make them
        interesting (laughs), but I kind of like the ones that are\ncontemplative
        or something. People will look at them and say, \u201coh, that looks like
        a starry night\nplate\u201d or something because there\u2019s almost no decoration
        except a few dots here or something\nlike that. They can kind of project onto
        them what they see in them. As opposed to some startling\nor obvious decoration,
        which I don\u2019t do. It\u2019s mostly about the forms for me, about simplifying\nthe
        forms. I admire the kind of simplicity of some Scandinavian designs from the
        twentieth\ncentury; clean kind of formative designs with all over color and
        texture.\nBut I\u2019m greatly influenced by our Minnesota history of MacKenzie\u2019s
        English and Japanese\ndesigned pottery making and hand making. Those are the
        pots I\u2019ve lived with and used. At the\nsame time I\u2019m respectful
        of the tradition that Janel came from. The teacher she worked with\ncame from
        the Bauhaus where things were very tight and almost industrial looking, designer-ly\nkinds
        of things.\nJJ: Not my pots necessarily but that\u2019s the history.\nWS:
        So I think any potter these days is aware of all of the different traditions
        and you kind of\npick and choose. I like simple, quiet kinds of pots.\nAW:
        So you said you met Bob probably during some of those Minnesota Crafts Council\nmeetings?\nWS:
        I think I remember at first, well do you remember when you met Bob?\nJJ: I
        met Bob at the Park Point Art Fair, and they lived over in the Little Falls
        area. So our paths\ndidn\u2019t cross a lot.\nWS: No.\nJJ: But then they moved
        up here and we all became friends then.\nWS: Well, but I knew him before he
        moved up here. Um\u2014\n01:55:15\nAW: Actually that brings up another point.
        When you moved up here were there other potters?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral
        Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n30\nJJ: Oh yeah, okay.
        I just want to make a note here. Something to add that I should talk about
        at\nsome point is the Bush Fellowship that I had in regards to my woodcarving.
        But that\u2019s something\nelse. When I first moved up here I approached Sunrise
        from North Branch and Jeff Oestreich\u2019s\naddress was Taylors Falls, and
        for me, not knowing how North Branch and Taylors Falls were\nrelated to one
        another I thought Jeff lived far away. So I moved up here and at some point
        one or\nthe other of us got in touch, and I was invited to Jeff\u2019s house
        for dinner and he said, \u201cwell, turn\nhere and turn here.\u201d It was
        only seven miles away (laughs)! Other potters? Rich Abnet was there\nmuch
        longer ago than either Jeff or I, and Warren MacKenzie also, but that\u2019s
        down by Stillwater\nand Marine [Marine On Saint Croix], so that\u2019s a different
        neighborhood really. It was Jeff first\nand then me and then Linda. Linda
        worked a little in Jeff\u2019s studio and then got her space set up,\nher
        first studio space set up over by Kost and then bought some property and built
        a house and\nworked in the basement. You know her story probably. I\u2019m
        not sure when Rick and Connee\ncame into the area, but they weren\u2019t there
        when I got here. Then Will came and Bob came and\nthings moved forward for
        the [St. Croix Pottery] tour from that point. Jeff and I would have\nspring
        and fall sales and we would occasionally try and do it on the same weekend
        and would\nmake a note on our postcards of sales that, well, that I was having
        a sale and he was having a\nsale. To try and encourage people to have two
        stops instead of one when they came up to the\narea. And then Linda, Jeff
        and I created a brochure for the three of us that we put in tourist spots\nand
        handed out to try and encourage, that was our marketing so to speak.\n[Janel
        shows AW the first brochure]\nAW: This is a great photo, it\u2019s amazing!\nWS:
        Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine who those people are these days. That was in
        the seventies.\nAW: So early on you were trying to work and promote with each
        other?\nJJ: Yeah. We\u2019re an easy drive from the cities and it\u2019s a
        nice day trip and a beautiful country. It\nwas not like the Tour but it was
        trying to encourage people to come out, which is what the Tour\nis doing.\nWS:
        I guess the difference between that that I see, is that, and it sounds self-serving,
        but the\ninitiative for the present day tour didn\u2019t come from you guys,
        it came from Bob and I at a later\ndate. If anything, Jeff and Linda were
        a little more reluctant to get involved in that, because they\nwere busy selling
        pottery other places and teaching classes and doing other things.\nJJ: They
        didn\u2019t care to do art fairs. That was not the direction.\nWS: And they
        weren\u2019t sure they wanted to do sales with people who did art fairs either.
        There\nwas just a different perception of who was doing what and what part
        of the art or craft world you\nwere part of.\nJJ: We all have different ways
        and make different choices.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson
        and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n31\nAW: So what led to the development of the
        Tour? Walk us through those early times.\nWS: At some point, well I don\u2019t
        remember and Bob probably told you this, exactly what year\nthey moved up
        here. I don\u2019t remember anymore.\nJJ: Well, if you want to work backwards,
        the house was pretty new when we announced that\nAvery was on his way and
        that was 1990. So they moved in during the late eighties.\nWS: Anyway, at
        that point Bob and I had become friends. We had been on the Minnesota Crafts\nCouncil
        board together and helped to run the St. Kate\u2019s Art Fair. Certainly I
        have to give Bob\ncredit for the initiative. It could have been me but it
        was probably he who said, \u201cwe\u2019re all up\nhere, you know, there are
        these potters close together, why don\u2019t we have a sale together?\u201d
        Jeff\nOestreich, in particular, had had some very successful sales earlier
        years where people came to\nhis house, and Janel had had sales here. I don\u2019t
        know that Linda ever had sales at her house very\nmuch, she might have, but
        not that we were involved in.\n02:00:40\nJJ: I think she had work in galleries
        more.\nWS: Right. She would send pots off to St. Louis and Chicago.\nSo, certainly
        the initiative was discussions between Bob and I around why don\u2019t we
        have sales\ntogether. Bob was fairly new to the area and basically he recruited
        Connee Mayeron. Bob had\nbeen on the board at the starting of the Northern
        Clay Center and Connee was involved in that.\nThey were both on the potters\u2019
        board. He had gotten to know her. Was she part of it [the St.\nCroix Pottery
        Tour] the first year though? I\u2019m not sure. Anyway, he recruited Connee
        and he had\ngotten to know Warren.\nJJ: Of the Tour?\nWS: Yeah, the first
        year of the Tour. I guess she was.\nAnyway, he recruited Connee and Warren
        and I recruited Jeff and Linda, Rick [Richard\nVincent], and Richard Abnet.
        People that I knew from the area. She wasn\u2019t was she?\nJJ: [Consulting
        notes] No, it was the second year [that Connee joined the Tour].\nWS: Yeah
        I think Connee came on board the second year of the Tour.\nAnd Warren, well,
        Bob talked with Warren. I\u2019ve never gotten to know Warren all that well.
        I\u2019m\nvery friendly with him but I haven\u2019t sought him out. I always
        felt like sort of a brown nose. So\nmany people are wanting Warren\u2019s
        attention, I\u2019m not going to be one of them, or whatever.\nThat\u2019s
        just my nature. Not that there is anything wrong with Bob doing that. Bob
        got to be very\nfriendly with Warren and convinced him that he could support
        us and be part of this, which he\ndid in the sense that he opened his studio.
        But then the rules we had made for being there and\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n32\nmeeting people,
        Warren wasn\u2019t able to follow that. He was hardly ever there during the
        time of\nthe Tour, so it didn\u2019t work out all that well and people were
        disappointed that he wasn\u2019t there.\nEven though they anticipated going
        to his place. That was kind of a conflict, so after three years\nWarren wasn\u2019t
        a part of it anymore. That was fine, he didn\u2019t need us certainly, he
        was just trying\nto help us out. Since then the group has stayed the same,
        except for when Richard Abnet died.\nRichard Abnet was somebody I had known
        from years ago. I met him at art fairs and talked with\nhim.\nJJ: Well then
        we added Guillermo. He had been a guest at Linda\u2019s for a few years and
        then\nmoved into the area and we all were very happy to--\nWS: Well he had
        been a guest for three years.\nJJ: Right, right. To accept him as another
        host.\nWS: And he had this amazing history. He\u2019s run a show like this
        for fourteen years in South\nAmerica, in Venezuela. So he was a great addition
        to the whole idea with his enthusiasm about\npottery.\nAW: So in those early
        years, as you were getting the group together, why did people just, you\nkind
        of describe people just knowing people\u2014\nWS: Well I think Janel and I
        knew Jeff and Linda. And I, and to a certain extent Janel too, knew\nRick
        [Richard] Vincent. I had met him actually at an art fair years before I had
        some pots I\nbought from him and I admired what he did. Rich Abnet I had met
        at the Har Mar Shopping Mall\nat an art fair years before selling pots. I\u2019d
        stopped at his house and visited from time to time. So\nit was our knowing
        Rich Abnet and Rick Vincent to a certain extent, enough to ask them to want\nto
        be part of this and to kind of talk them into it. Everybody had their own
        approach, everybody\nhad their own doubts about it. Linda and Jeff, I think,
        had real doubts about whether they wanted\nto embark in some kind of crass
        marketing event, you know? They were into selling their pots at\ngalleries
        and teaching workshops and the whole idea of kind of an art fair situation
        didn\u2019t appeal\nto them very much. Everybody had their own approach and
        came from a different world. As\nmuch as the outside world sees pottery as
        all the same, each one of us has a different lifestyle in\npottery. We all
        sell our pots in different places and we have different customers and different\nways
        of putting it out there. I mean Jeff Oestreich is an internationally known
        potter, he\u2019s quite a\ncelebrity, as is Linda Christianson in her own
        way.\n02:05:50\nJJ: That\u2019s part of what makes it so compellingly interesting
        for people to attend. Having guests,\nthere\u2019s a little concern on some
        of our parts that not enough new guests have been on the roster\nover the
        years.\nWS: That\u2019s a current concern.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n33\nJJ: Yeah. It\u2019s slowed down.
        The turnover. It\u2019s so hard to say, \u201cyou can\u2019t be here anymore\u201d
        after\nsuccess has happened. It\u2019s real tricky. And the group had made
        the decision to limit to eight\nguests, or seven guests?\nWS: It\u2019s a
        limit, but it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s almost kind of a joke. I mean eight people
        plus the host, so\nthat\u2019s nine artists at each location. No customer
        can possibly go and visit sixty-three people. You\ncan\u2019t visit every
        one and buy something from them.\nJJ: Well it\u2019s been fifty-two at the
        most so far.\nWS: There are seven locations, so if there were nine people
        at each location it would be sixty-three.\nIt\u2019s not yet, but it could
        be.\nJJ: Oh, you mean theoretically.\nWS: It\u2019s fifty, fifty-one right
        now. Anyway, one of our current concerns is keeping it fresh and\nhaving new
        artists come in from time to time.\nJJ: You know, I am a sounding board for
        when Will is considering who to ask. This year the\nconversation hadn\u2019t
        been had with some of the people who reached their third year this year.\nUltimately,
        with much anguish throughout the whole show, Will finally ended up inviting
        them\nback for next year.\nWS: When I invite people, I invite them for three
        years at a time. That\u2019s just our policy. Every\nstudio does their own
        thing. They can invite them [the guest potters] for as long or as little as\nthey
        want.\nJJ: But he had also already invited a couple of other artists for next
        year so in the end we are\ngoing to have more artists here than ever before.\nWS:
        We are going to have eight guests next year.\nJJ: So there won\u2019t be room
        for me as a potter by the numbers, if I wanted to be a potter for next\nyear,
        but I bet I could sweet talk the group into it (laughs).\nWS: Janel has taken,
        two or three years in particular, and spent two or three weeks or so making\npottery
        and then being on the list of potters, and then people would know they could
        come and\nfind pots by Janel. She did it last year [in 2013].\nJJ: It depends
        if I go to the Smithsonian Craft Show, which happens just a few weeks before
        the\nTour. When I have that I have really not enough time to make a good body
        of work and I need to\nbe focused on carving the wood pieces.\nWS: So we\u2019ve
        already kind of decided we won\u2019t do it next year.\nA Measure of the Earth
        Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n34\nJJ: Yeah, because
        of our number of artists. And that\u2019s fine because I\u2019ve got some
        work I want to\nbe doing aside from clay work.\nWS: The initial getting people
        involved was probably the most interesting part of the whole\nshow, when I
        think back on it. I think about my approach to Rick Vincent, for example,
        and what\nhe would think of it and Rich Abnet, who was not easy to convince.
        He was a curmudgeon.\nJJ: But he did well. He never had guest artists but
        he did very well there.\nWS: Oh yeah. He did great. He was a productive potter
        who always had hundreds and hundreds\nof pots. What else can you have when
        people show up? You know you want to have a lot of\nwork to offer them.\nJJ:
        Having new artists keeps it, I think, makes it more interesting. The concept,
        anyway, that\nthere will be something new to look at. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s
        the same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019 every time; people\nlike to be able to count
        on seeing things again and it sometimes takes two or three years for\nsomeone
        to actually want to start taking pots home. It\u2019s also up to the guest
        potter a little bit if\nthey want to stay past the first year.\n02:10:25\nWS:
        The original asking people to come, it was the fifth year that we invited
        guests to come.\nAnd most of the original guests that we had were local or
        regional potters.\nJJ: It was 1997 [that guest potters were first invited
        to sell at the Tour].\nWS: We invited someone from Minnesota to come, some
        potters from Duluth. Gail Kendall was\nhere, who was teaching at Macalester
        at the time. They were regional guests. Going beyond that,\nI think Bob and
        I we would talk about the show year round, whenever we\u2019d get together
        we\u2019d\nsay, \u201cwhat if we did this, and what if we did this.\u201d
        Then we had the experience of going out to an\ninvitational in New York City,
        or in New Jersey actually, in Demarest, New Jersey, which Bob\nmaybe mentioned
        in his ramblings. It was an invitational event that was a benefit for an arts\ncenter.
        They had potters from all over the United States coming and it was great.
        The quality of\nthe pottery was really great. The support of the event wasn\u2019t
        all that great; they worked for years\nand years and years to get beyond fifty
        thousand dollars\u2019 worth of sales. Then they thought\nmaybe they\u2019d
        get to a hundred thousand.\nWhen we started having guests years later we went
        way past all that. Our sales were much\ngreater than this event that we were
        really kind of modeling after out East. Our audience was, in\nthat sense,
        better than the New York City audience. Or we were better at getting them
        here or\nsomething. But I think it was seeing that event out in New Jersey
        that was an invitational. It\nwasn\u2019t an art fair where you sent in a
        juried slide or something; it was potters meeting other\npotters and deciding,
        \u201chey, I really like what you\u2019re doing and I think my customers would
        really\nlike seeing what you\u2019re doing, so why don\u2019t you come and
        sell your pots at my house?\u201d Which, a\nlot of people right away told
        us, \u201cwell, you won\u2019t sell as much if you bring people in\u201d.
        Of course,\nthat\u2019s not what happened at all. What happened was the whole
        thing just got bigger and bigger\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n35\nand bigger. We got many, many more
        people to come and we sold a lot more pottery. That\u2019s sort\nof the bottom
        line on inviting guests.\nAW: Why do you think that helps the Tour? Why do
        you think that helped it grow?\nWS: Well it gave us a status. We\u2019re known
        as the show somewhere in the United States where\npeople get selected from
        around the country to come there and be part of that show. It\u2019s so good\nthat
        they can pick the best potters from around the country and they\u2019ll go
        there and they\u2019ll sell\nmore than they sell anywhere else. You know,
        they will sell more there than they\u2019ll sell at any art\nfair or maybe
        even at their own studios sometimes.\nJJ: And because there is such a great
        variety between each of the studios in the experience that\nthey have there
        and with the potters that they see there, if there were seven studios and
        only one\npotter in each studio and it didn\u2019t change from year to year,
        people could choose to go\nsomewhere else do something because they\u2019d
        have already seen it. We don\u2019t change that much,\nbut to have so many
        different potters it becomes a very appealing event to come and see. You\nknow
        you are going to see new things, you may see the same people, but everybody
        all together\nmoves forward with what they are doing and it just becomes a
        great destination; an idea place\nand a place to get things to bring into
        their lives.\nWS: It is about ideas and about people too. We always stress
        that if a potter comes here to show\ntheir work and to sell their work, they
        have to make themselves available. We want them to be\nthere as if people
        are coming to visit their own studio. We want it to feel like an open house.
        We\ndon\u2019t want them to be busy doing sales or being otherwise involved.\nJJ:
        Each of the potters have people who come and beeline right for them first,
        because they want\nto see their work. And then there are people who see friends
        that they\u2019ve made out of the\ncustomers that they\u2019ve met here. So
        there is a lot of human interaction, a lot of social sharing.\n02:15:15\nWS:
        And some of that is the nature of the pottery. If you drink your daily coffee
        out of a mug\nthat you bought from somebody last year at the pottery tour,
        then you\u2019re going to be glad to see\nthem again. It\u2019s a connection
        of the product as well as the person. The other part of that, of\ncourse,
        is that it\u2019s ceramics. It\u2019s only ceramics, it\u2019s only pottery;
        it\u2019s not painting, photography\nand sculpture. If you are somebody who
        is interested in pottery, you\u2019re going to go there and see\na wealth
        of really good pottery. There\u2019s nowhere else you can see it, there really
        isn\u2019t. Maybe\ntoday at the Northern Clay Center you can go and see little
        vignettes or groups of pottery from\nall over the United States. That never
        existed when we started doing this. Here you can go and\nsee three hundred
        pots by one person and talk to them, and they\u2019re someone who has been\nselected
        from the other side of the country to come here and bring their work. It\u2019s
        a preselected\ngroup of people and it\u2019s only pottery.\nAW: So, who have
        been your guests in the past and how have you decided? Do you have criteria\nfor
        who you are looking for and why you decide to invite certain people?\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n36\nWS:
        Well, our first guests were the Husby\u2019s who are this energetic couple
        from Duluth who have\nmade pots for decades and who have been known in the
        Minnesota arts community. He has\ntaught at the University [of Minnesota]
        and she\u2019s someone who has organized all sorts of arts\nevents in Duluth.\nJJ:
        She\u2019s a mover and shaker up in Duluth. She\u2019s great.\nAW: How did
        you meet them?\nJJ: Well, let\u2019s see. She called me to do a telephone
        interview when she was doing graduate work.\nWS: I met her before I met you
        at a pottery workshop she was helping to administer, way, way\nback when.
        I don\u2019t know if she was even making pottery then, but she was involved
        in the arts.\nAW: And what\u2019s her name?\nWS: Cheryl [and Bob] Husby. C-H-E-R-Y-L
        H-U-S-B-Y. They were our first guests. They were\nchosen because they were
        close by and they were energetic, not because their pottery was my\nfavorite.
        It never has been. They\u2019re great, but I like other people\u2019s pottery
        better than what they\nmake. I shouldn\u2019t say that\u2014I shouldn\u2019t
        put that on tape! (Laughs)\nThen the next year we invited Malcolm Davis, who
        is from Washington D.C., who eventually\ngot kind of a national reputation
        for what he did. He was very well known for teaching\nworkshops. We met him
        at the Smithsonian Craft Show in Washington D.C. that Janel was doing\nwith
        her porcelain. And we stayed at his house.\nJJ: He had such a wonderful, interesting,
        complex personality. We so enjoyed him. As a side\nnote, that was the year
        I came down with pneumonia. It was the week of the Tour, and Will\ncouldn\u2019t
        take me in. Finally I went in on Wednesday and saw the first doctor but he
        sent me\nhome. My heart was pounding and everything and I had a high fever
        and on Friday a different\ndoctor said, \u201cgo to the hospital, you have
        pneumonia.\u201d\nWS: So that weekend you spent in the hospital.\nJJ: Yeah,
        and that night there was a tornado in the region and it knocked out our electricity.
        Will\nhad to un-stack the kiln and Avery was very young, he was six at the
        time. So I said, \u201ccan you\nget a neighbor to help?\u201d So we called
        some neighbors--\nWS: They brought water down, you know, their water wells
        were working and ours wasn\u2019t. We\ncouldn\u2019t flush our toilets and
        we had a thousand people coming.\nJJ: Malcolm was going to stay at our house
        but he decided, \u201cno, I\u2019m not going to go in that\nhouse.\u201d So
        he stayed over with Jeff [Oestreich].\nWS: He didn\u2019t want to get pneumonia.
        Then a couple years later he ended up being Jeff\u2019s guest\nover at Jeff\u2019s
        house.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n37\nWS:
        So, over the years we\u2019ve recruited more people from far away to come
        here. People who are\nreally outstanding potters from other parts of the country.
        Malcolm Davis, in particular, then the\nnext year we had Steven Hill, who
        at the time was sort of a star. He had his picture on the front\nof Ceramics
        Monthly magazine. He\u2019s from Kansas City and he was making beautiful pots,
        so we\ninvited him to come here. The next year we had Steven again and a fellow
        from Connecticut who\nmade spectacular pots that people had never seen in
        Minnesota before.\nJJ: Yeah, thin slab hand-built.\nWS: But he had some history
        here, he had gone to school at the University of Minnesota.\nJJ: His name
        was Hayne Bayless.\n02:20:20\nWS: Anyway, the next year we repeated some of
        those people. A couple years later we had some\npeople from Philadelphia that
        no one here had ever seen that I had met on my travels to this\nshow in New
        Jersey. For a long time we weren\u2019t very good about focusing on people
        from\nMinnesota. We wanted to bring in somebody to our customers that they
        had never seen before.\nThat was part of what I was thinking anyway. We did
        the same thing in 2004, a couple of years\nlater. We invited Mark Shapiro
        and Sam Taylor, who are people I met on the East coast. They\nlive in Massachusetts
        and make beautiful pots. They were here for a couple of years, and now\nthey
        are here again. They were gone for a few years and now they\u2019ve been here
        for several years\nagain. The same thing happened with two women, Ellen Shankin
        and Silvie Granatelli, that\nwe\u2019ve had now for several years in a row.
        I met them in New Jersey, too, and kind of approached\nthem like a\u2014\nJJ:
        In New Jersey?\nWS: At Demarest. At the Demarest Art Fair, at the invitational
        show. When I approached them I\nthought, these ladies make spectacular pots.
        They\u2019re never going to want to come to Minnesota.\nBut they immediately
        said, \u201cof course! We\u2019ve heard all about it.\u201d So that\u2019s
        been really\nreinforcing. People now know and they sell, Ellen will sell twice
        as many pots as I will. She\u2019s a\nspectacular designer and producer of
        handmade things. And she plans ahead, she\u2019s a really\ndiligent worker;
        she shows up with four hundred pots, whereas somebody else will have two\nhundred.
        She\u2019s just really ready and she goes home with buckets full of money.
        People come\nhere to see her now probably more than they come to see me. She
        sells more pots than I do.\nJJ: And Silvie too. She has a limited inventory
        of wonderful, wonderful pots. So if you want\ncertain pots you have to be
        there early. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to watch people come to see their
        potters\nand have wonderful conversations and go home with armloads of pots.
        It\u2019s so gratifying to have\nthis kind of venue to have so many potters
        have a successful experience.\nAW: And how do you guys work with the guest
        artists? Do they stay here? What is kind of your\nprocess a few days before
        the Tour opens?\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J.
        Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n38\nWS: We haven\u2019t had anybody stay here for a
        couple of years now. We\u2019ve actually had our house\nalmost empty. Except
        for maybe a helper; Nancy might stay over or if Avery is here he might\nstay.\nJJ:
        Yeah, we had them a little bit stay over, but over time other choices have
        been made. Mark\nand Sam stay down at Sam\u2019s auntie\u2019s house in Afton
        [Minnesota] and the ladies stay up the road\nat a bed and breakfast that we
        first put them in because, well, we have just one bathroom and\nWill is uneasy
        about having a group of people share one bathroom.\nWS: Well, it\u2019s okay.
        It just makes for more stress. Having more and more and more people in the\nhouse
        and you have to make breakfast for everybody.\nJJ: So the bed and breakfast
        is a log cabin and the bathroom is in an outhouse-style building, but\nit\u2019s
        heated and it\u2019s got a shower and toilet. It\u2019s very nice, so they
        stay there every time. And\nanother guest gets a room at an AmericInn [in
        North Branch, MN].\nWS: So that actually works nicely for us. It reduces the
        stress. I know Bob and Mary- Bob\nprobably talked about this- over the years
        they had more and more people staying at their house,\nand they still have
        some, but it\u2019s helped them a lot to kind of say, \u201cwait a minute,
        this is way too\nmuch.\u201d\nJJ: So it depends on how far back you want to
        go in our preparations for the Tour. We kind of\nstart after the Philadelphia
        show. I do the website because by then almost everybody has got their\nimages
        in, even though they are supposed to be in by September. There are a few always\ndragging
        their feet. Will knuckles down with the poster and gets that done before the
        end of the\nyear so we can have that out in places. Then we both get to work
        on what we need to do of our\nown things. In February we start baking cookies
        every Sunday until we have accomplished at\nleast the five batches. This year
        it totaled about thirty four hundred. Then I start baking banana\nbread and
        get several batches of that made and our freezers are solid filled with baked
        goods.\nLast year we had somebody make gluten-free cookies and she had six
        hundred last year and\nalmost tripled it this year [2014] to about fifteen
        hundred.\nAnyway, we had a lot more baked goods ready. The audience [in 2014]
        was just a little lower so\nwe ended up having some cookies left. When we\u2019re
        done with that we work again on preparing.\nWhen I get back from the Smithsonian
        everything else needs to get ready. I make food for the\ngroup, which is a
        large number of people, for three days. The ladies organize with the other
        guest\npotters one night\u2019s dinner with soup, so we don\u2019t have to
        worry about having a communal\ndinner. The other nights we go somewhere else,
        to Connee\u2019s house or to Bob\u2019s where dinner is\nprovided.\n02:26:30\nWS:
        I think each group we do this we do dinner on Saturday night. I think at each
        location\nthey\u2019ve evolved their own kind of cultural habits or routines,
        having dinner and what kind of\nfood they prepare. We do a lot, and everybody
        feels like they do a lot.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson
        and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n39\nJJ: So we put out all the cookies and breads,
        cold milk, lemonade, coffee and hot water for tea.\nAnd then in the clay room
        we have set up the small refrigerator with whatever we can fit in there\nand
        several coolers and a crockpot with something hot and then cheese and meat,
        vegetables and\nfruit and whatever else anybody brings.\nWS: But that\u2019s
        for our potters, not for all the customers.\nJJ: That\u2019s true, but for
        me it\u2019s part of the preparation for the show. It\u2019s all work that\u2019s
        got to get\ndone and it\u2019s not income producing. It\u2019s to help make
        the event succeed and make everybody\nhappy and it\u2019s just the way it
        is.\nWS: Looking back, though, on the history, this has all gotten to be bigger
        and bigger and bigger.\nAll the food, all the cookies in particular, and all
        the baking; it\u2019s all much bigger than it was\nyears and years and years
        ago. Now it takes a lot of planning and preparation.\nJJ: Yeah, but it isn\u2019t
        like what Bob and Mary did.\nAW: It does seem like that is an important part
        of the Tour, is the providing of some kind of\nfood\u2014\nJJ: There aren\u2019t
        many places for someone to stop for something quick.\nWS: When we got this
        group together, we said, \u201cwe want this to be like an open house; we want\nit
        to be just like your best open house when you invite people to come to your
        studio and see\nwhere you work and what your life is about in pottery.\u201d
        Because we all understand that we make\nthis stuff by hand. If people are
        going to buy it they want to connect with you, you know, they\nwant to take
        a little piece of you home. So the whole idea is to make it easy for them
        to connect\nwith you, to see where you live. How many times have people gotten
        out of their cars and said,\n\u201cgeez, I\u2019d like to live out in the
        country and make pottery,\u201d or heard that sort of vicarious thing\nfrom
        customers. That\u2019s the thing we want to build on over the years. For the
        first few years I\nwould always remind people and say, \u201cRemember this
        is not just a pottery sale. You\u2019re not just\nsetting this up so people
        can come give you the money and go home. You want them to connect\nwith you
        otherwise they\u2019ll never come back.\u201d That was my thinking about it.
        And that\u2019s part of\nthe cookies and part of the having potters there
        enforcing the idea that they are there to talk to\npeople. That they can\u2019t
        disappear, they can\u2019t go watch T.V. or something while the sale is going\non.
        They have to be there. You have to bring your friends to help with the sales
        so you can meet\nthe customers.\nJJ: We ask each potter to bring a helper,
        so the husbands and wives come. In this case the\nhusbands are the helpers,
        oh and Karin [Kraemer], she brings her husband, but she also brings\nhelpers
        on different days, which has been wonderful for me because always one of them
        has\nhelped me with the tallying. And the helpers are wonderful to get to
        know. It\u2019s just a huge people\nweekend that starts on Thursday and ends
        suddenly on Sunday night, when they go out the door\nand then I feel like
        I just haven\u2019t had enough time to be with the people that we care about
        that\nhave come to be together.\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n40\n02:30:15\nWS: The potters you mean?\nJJ:
        Yeah, the potters. It just goes by so fast.\nWS: Well I always try to focus
        on welcoming the people in. Bob\u2019s overwhelming success and\nhis kind
        of, I think people think of the pottery tour they sometimes think about Bob
        Briscoe\u2019s\nbecause he\u2019s got beer and food and wine. It\u2019s all
        about hospitality for him. He just wants to pile\non the hospitality and have
        people have a good time, like he\u2019s having a party. In fact he does, on\nFriday
        night. The pottery sale goes on and then people stay and they have a party
        on Friday\nnight. He\u2019s been an example for many of the other people.
        And for us, to a certain extent and\neven for Connee, who started giving people
        popcorn or something. At first it was kind of\nhesitant, like, oh, we should
        feed them something? (laughs) Now Guillermo\u2019s feeding everyone\nand Linda
        fed everyone and now we have food trucks. So it\u2019s changed and evolved
        over the\nyears. And it will probably continue to change and I hope we continue
        to keep in mind why\nwe\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s for the experience the
        people have, not just the fact that they leave some\nmoney in your pocket.
        Otherwise they won\u2019t come back. The other thing, though, that we didn\u2019t\ntalk
        about very much\u2014\nJJ: We didn\u2019t get through our guest list, either,
        but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s important.\nWS: Well, we did kind of.
        Our guests basically all came from far afield until a couple of years\nago.
        Until I started inviting some people from Minnesota with the idea that, duh,
        there are some\npeople in Minnesota who have been here for decades that have
        great mailing lists (laughs). They\ncould help us by giving us their mailing
        lists and bringing their customers to us. You know, we\nshouldn\u2019t just
        be bringing people from the outside.\nJJ: And a little bit of a conscious
        decision to try and include a younger potter--\nWS: Younger potters too, yeah.\nJJ:
        --that have some establishment so far, or have been established a little bit.
        Because we are all\naging and none of us exactly know where the Tour is going
        to be going. It is great to see that\nthere are younger potters finding their
        way into the scene in the region. It\u2019s good to recognize\nthat. We have
        one who is not young, young, but he is not our age, Ernest Miller.\nWS: Well,
        he\u2019s forty or something.\nJJ: Well, he\u2019s twenty years younger than
        we are.\nAW: How did you meet Ernest?\nWS: I saw him at an art fair somewhere.
        I saw his work and thought what\u2019s he doing at this\ncrappy art fair.
        He makes beautiful pottery, then I talked to him and went to visit him at
        his\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n41\nstudio
        and got the sense that he\u2019s trying to make a life in clay. That\u2019s
        the kind of person I want to\ninvite.\nJJ: I met his work but not him when
        I was on a McKnight or Jerome; I think it was the McKnight\npanel, many years
        ago.\nWS: Yeah, so you saw his resume?\nJJ: Yeah, I saw his work and his resume.\nAW:
        It sounds like a lot of the guest artists you have you met at art fairs.\nWS:
        Yeah, I guess so.\nJJ: Yes, when their pots are out. Through seeing their
        pots, yeah. Mostly you, but I might point\nsomeone out once in a while. Will
        is the one who is mostly balancing everything.\nWS: Well I tend to invite
        people who are really trying to make this work for themselves. For the\nmost
        part they are not college professors; they don\u2019t have another income.
        They are usually\nsomebody who is trying to make a life working in clay, whether
        they are making functional pots\nor sculpture or whatever it is they are doing,
        they are committed to it. And I think our customers\nwould appreciate that.
        I guess the other part I feel like I should mention in some way is that Janel\nand
        I have both been extremely involved in the operating of this thing from day
        one. We\u2019ve\npassed some of it around from years to years, other people
        have done various parts of it, and then\nwe\u2019ve taken parts of it back.
        Janel, when we did the website, launched into being the person who\ncreated
        the website and she still does it today. We hand drew the maps to start with
        and collected\nall the photos, arranged the printing and distributed all the
        fliers. We still do all that. We still do\nthe fliers, although, for some
        years Bob Briscoe did it, for like six years, with his friend Jessie,\nand
        Linda [Christianson] did it for a few years. Now we\u2019re back to doing
        it again. The mailing\nlist is a really big job, and now Guillermo and his
        wife Laurie help with that. They collect some\nof the names and then we put
        it all together.\n02:35:40\nJJ: You put it together.\nWS: Yeah, well there
        used to be this horrible job of visually looking through the mailing list
        to\npick out the duplicates.\nJJ: That was my job.\nWS: Yeah you did that
        at one point, Bob and Mary did it once, Linda did it once. Everybody did\nit,
        and then we realized, this could be done by computer. So these days it\u2019s
        done by computer.\nJJ: Yeah, modern mailing services are great.\nA Measure
        of the Earth Oral Histories\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n42\nWS:
        So we\u2019ve eliminated that, because we sent out thirty-eight thousand last
        year.\nJJ: And that\u2019s after all the duplicates [have been removed].\nWS:
        Well let\u2019s see, that\u2019s not right. We printed thirty-nine thousand
        last year and sent out thirty\nor thirty-one thousand. We sent about fifteen
        thousand outside the state of Minnesota, and about\nfifteen thousand inside
        the state of Minnesota. That\u2019s the combined mailing list that happens\nevery
        year; it starts over we put all the mailing lists together and try to eliminate
        the six or seven\nthousand duplicates.\nJJ: Yeah, and that was one of my missions,
        to impress upon the fact that this job actually needs\nto be done because
        the posters cost money and at that time it was just seven mailing lists being\ncombined.
        If someone was on all seven mailing lists, they would get that many and that\u2019s\nannoying.
        You don\u2019t want to annoy the customers. And we wanted to save some money.
        So\noriginally I\u2019d organize it by last name and then by address and just
        visually separate out all but\none.\nWS: Remember Linda had a broken leg once,
        or surgery on her knee, and she laid in bed and\nsorted through all the things
        one year (laughs).\nJJ: Yeah, what a job. Now there are companies that can
        just put it all in together and correct the\naddresses and send everything
        back.\nWS: All the tasks that run the Tour have never been distributed equally.
        We\u2019ve always done\nmore of our share, certainly, and some people do little
        to help but lend advice and support. That\u2019s\njust been accepted over
        the years as the way that it works. In order to work people have to do\nwhat
        they are used to doing to get it done. I\u2019m not complaining when I say
        that, I\u2019m just pointing\nout the fact that it\u2019s worked the way it
        is. I don\u2019t think it would work if we tried to split\neverything up and
        have everybody do an equal job somehow.\nAW: Do you think people\u2019s roles
        and tasks that they are doing have kind of fallen to what they\ndo well or
        what they\u2019ve been able to handle? Because certain tasks have been passed
        to different\npeople for a time, but then\u2014\nWS: Absolutely.\nJJ: Yeah,
        we\u2019ve learned to do those things well. If somebody took on a job and
        got over the \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to do this\u201d part, maybe they would
        learn to do the job well also. But it\u2019s really hard to\nactually tell
        someone that it\u2019s changing.\nWS: At this point it\u2019s much harder
        to show or tell somebody how to do something that you are\nalready doing,
        or it seems like it is. It kind of goes on from year to year with people saying,\n\u201cwell,
        let\u2019s everybody do what they did last year.\u201d You know? And it works.\nJJ:
        Sometimes, and I can\u2019t remember what inspired the answer from what question,
        but part of\nwhat makes the Tour work, people from elsewhere ask \u201chow
        can we set up our own thing [tour\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n43\nevent]?\u201d One of the things that
        works for us is that we have a meeting once a year after the event\nand we
        talk about the successes and failures and brainstorm about what else needs
        to be\nconsidered or what else to add or eliminate. Looking ahead a couple
        years, now we\u2019ve got our\ntwenty-fifth anniversary coming up. We\u2019re
        not working hard on it yet but the ideas are falling\ninto place. But it\u2019s
        a respectful meeting where we value what each other has to say about all the\nthings
        being considered.\nWS: Over the years, well, in earlier years some people
        would say, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know how much\nlonger I want to do this.\u201d
        And then somebody else would say, \u201cWell, why can\u2019t we just do it
        on\nSunday instead of on Friday, Saturday and Sunday?\u201d There were always
        ideas coming up but\nwe\u2019ve always kind of weathered through those and
        made it just a little bigger and better over the\nyears without making bad
        decisions. Somehow most of the decisions we made seem to have\nworked and
        they\u2019ve kept the group together.\n02:40:50\nJJ: By reaching a consensus.\nWS:
        Yeah, just as a friendly consensus. Not everybody always agreed, but they
        would agree to\ngo along if they didn\u2019t and nobody quit. (Laughs)\nAW:
        Were there ever any tense moments or tough decisions? What have been some
        of the\nchallenges that the Tour has faced?\nJJ: Well, those that lobbied
        to have one day instead of two, because mother\u2019s day was a problem\nfor
        them. I mean they wanted to spend it with their mothers. Adding Friday and
        making it a\nthree-day event\u2014\nWS: Yeah, adding Friday. Bob and I wanted
        to add Friday several years before the group agreed\nto do it.\nJJ: And it\u2019s
        been a very important addition and everybody I think sees that.\nWS: Initially
        in the early years it wasn\u2019t totally easy to get everybody to share their
        mailing lists.\nJJ: And have them be updated.\nWS: Yeah, and to have them
        updated. We had to point out to people how important that is. Every\nperson
        on a mailing list is probably somebody who is interested in what you are doing.
        If you\ndon\u2019t use that list, every time you go out to a street art fair
        you\u2019re just looking for every one of a\nhundred people who are interested,
        or one in a thousand. So you have this great list of people\nwho are already
        interested. You gotta really focus on that.\nJJ: Some sticky situations occur,
        one artist committed two different years and because of a\nphysical ailment
        or inability to be ready because of physical things or things happening with
        the\nkiln couldn\u2019t participate but the name was on the poster and so
        forth. Trying to decide, do we\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\nW.
        Swanson and J. Jacobson\n06\/30\/14\n44\ngive the money back or does his payment
        stand. And then when a husband and wife bring their\nwork, is there a distinction
        between his and hers or is it a unified work, and do we charge for one\nor
        two. Those things are kind of grey discussion areas that we have to deal with
        one case at a\ntime.\nWS: The biggest change we made, actually, in the early
        years everyone paid, in terms of the\norganization of it, on a percentage
        basis. I\u2019m sure other people might have remembered this and\ntold you;
        I\u2019m sure Bob [Briscoe] doesn\u2019t forget it. I guess maybe through
        2003 or 2004\neverybody paid on a percentage basis based on how much they
        sold. At the time I was being\ntreasurer also, and everybody would call me
        and say how much they sold for the whole weekend,\nand then I would figure
        a percentage and say, \u201cour expenses for the year were six thousand\ndollars,
        so your percentage of that is this because you sold so much.\u201d Well, it
        became a\ndisincentive because we have some people, whose names shall go mentionless,
        who wouldn\u2019t\nprepare for this show like they could, and they wouldn\u2019t
        sell very much because then they didn\u2019t\nhave to pay very much. But it
        certainly didn\u2019t help the overall event to look very good, because\nsome
        people didn\u2019t have many pots. Then the people who would prepare the most
        would end up\npaying for the whole thing because they\u2019d have really good
        sales. Bob Briscoe, in particular,\nwith his marketing and enthusiasm would
        sell really well, and he\u2019d end up paying this enormous\namount compared
        to what some other people paid because they just didn\u2019t take time or
        have time\nto make enough pots. So, at some point we said, \u201cduh. Why
        don\u2019t we charge everybody a share,\nhave everybody pay one share, and
        that way they\u2019re going to be paying the same percentage as\neverybody
        else of the total expenses and they\u2019ll have an incentive to bring a lot
        of good pots.\nAnd then we eventually did this for our guests also, so every
        host and every guest pays the same\nshare. This has worked really well for
        us. The only people who suffer at all are the ones who\nmaybe are new here
        so don\u2019t sell quite as well. But our expenses still end up being maybe
        twenty\npercent of their overall sales. They\u2019re still really a small
        amount compared to any other sales\nvenue, like selling in a gallery where
        they take fifty percent.\n02:45:35\nJJ: Or going to the art fairs we go to.\nWS:
        Yeah, even going to the expensive art fairs we go to where you are paying
        maybe a\nthousand dollars for a spot. So that was the biggest change we made,
        and maybe it was the most\ncontroversial in that it changed our whole way
        of encouraging people to bring pots, and\nencouraging them to be successful.
        It really helped when we got new guest artists coming in,\nthen they knew
        they were just paying the same amount you were paying; they had the same\nopportunity
        you had.\nJJ: In 1999 we started adding a five percent contribution, and it\u2019s
        a set amount now to be donated\nto something\u2014\nWS: Now it\u2019s six
        thousand dollars.\nJJ: The Weisman Art Museum was the recipient for a few
        years, and also regional schools, art\ndepartments, the U of M ceramics","transl":{},"fullrs":{},"find":"123.pdf","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2015-02-13","dmmodified":"2015-02-13","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"122","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"505740","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.48
