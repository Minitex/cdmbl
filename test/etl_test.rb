This interview is for the “A Measure of the Earth: An Oral\\nHistory of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,” made possible by the Minnesota Historical\\nand Cultural Heritage Grants. Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb, Project\\nAssistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed and why don’t we get started. First if we\\ncould just learn a little bit more about you—when and where were you born?\\nCMC: I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, March 1949.\\nAW: Where in Minneapolis?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n2\\nCMC: I was born on 60th and Elliot. I moved away when I was six to St. Louis Park. My early\\nmemories are vague of pre-moving to St. Louis Park.\\nAW: What was it like in St. Louis Park where you grew up?\\nCMC: Very suburban. Very typical Minnesota. Lots of trees, lots of lakes. Very pleasant, very\\npeaceful.\\nAW: Did you have brothers and sisters?\\nCMC: I have one brother and one sister.\\nAW: Where do you fall in the--?\\nCMC: --I’m in the middle, the sensitive child.\\nAW: Your parents—what did they do?\\nCMC: My mother was the quintessential housewife—went to every performance and soccer\\ngame that we ever had and always had all meals on the table. My father was a civil engineer so\\nhe planned water and sewage systems in Minneapolis and ultimately in places out of the\\ncountry—Africa, Peru. I grew up with someone that was very in tune with math.\\nAW: Did he travel a lot?\\nCMC: Yes.\\nAW: Did you ever get to go with him?\\nCMC: No, but my parents believed in traveling so we would travel every year somewhere as a\\nfamily.\\nAW: Where were some of the places you went while you were growing up?\\nCMC: We went to the Caribbean. We went to Hawaii. We went all around the United States. A\\nlot of car trips in the United States. Went to Mexico, went to Europe, New York—well, that’s the\\nUnited States. I don’t know, things like that.\\nAW: Did you enjoy those experiences?\\nCMC: They were my favorite. Those and going to camp, yes.\\nAW: Where did you go to camp?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n3\\nCMC: I went to camp in Northern Minnesota.\\nAW: Part of a Y camp?\\nCMC: No, it was a girls’ camp [Camp Lake Hubert for Girls]. A Catholic girls’ camp but I\\nwasn’t Catholic.\\nAW: Did you go there often?\\nCMC: I went there for a month in the summer for about five or six years.\\nAW: What was it like up there?\\nCMC: It was like this, in the woods. We sailed, we shot guns, we rode horses.\\nAW: Where did you go to school?\\nCMC: Public high school, St. Louis Park. I’m part of the baby boomer generation so my\\ngraduating class had about eight hundred students.\\nAW: Did you have any experiences with pottery or ceramics during that time?\\nCMC: No, absolutely not. Didn’t know it existed.\\nAW: What were your favorite subjects to study?\\nCMC: I didn’t like studying. I don’t know that I had a favorite. I liked Shakespeare. I wasn’t a\\nstudent. I wasn’t at all academic when I was young.\\nAW: When you were finishing high school—what were your thoughts about what you were\\ngoing to do next?\\nCMC: I ended up going to the University of Colorado because I loved skiing. I don’t know that\\nhaving a career was ever emphasized—as a matter of fact it was de-emphasized in my house.\\nWomen were not supposed to have careers. They were supposed to be married and have\\nchildren. I loved the mountains. I ended up going there because of the environment, not because\\nof the academics.\\n00:05:20\\nAW: And while you were there, what did you major in?\\nCMC: I majored in communications because I liked people and that was about as deep as my\\nthoughts went. I liked people so I’ll major in communications.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n4\\nAW: How long were you out there?\\nCMC: I was there for three years. It was during the Vietnam War and it was when a lot of\\ncollege campuses—the students were really starting to talk about things that were going on in the\\nworld and in America, and that had never been part of my exposure growing up. The Civil\\nRights Movement took place—I didn’t even know what it was. Really in college that was my\\nfirst exposure to racism, to sexism, to Eastern religion—to all the things that were being talked\\nabout at that time on campuses. I think that I was mystified and horrified and very overwhelmed\\nby the times and all that information. I decided that I would drop out of school because I didn’t\\nreally know what I was doing there. This was much to my father’s horror because he considered\\neducation to be a huge privilege. Because it was given to me I don’t think that I really\\nappreciated it, and I felt like I was squandering my father’s money and my time.\\nI started to hitchhike to San Francisco from Boulder, and I stopped in Steamboat Springs and left\\nfour years later. It was in Steamboat Springs—a small ski town of about two thousand people at\\nthe time. I got a job being a waitress and I got a job in a leather shop. I think the way I was living\\na lot was pretty much a cliché of the time. I learned how to have a garden and I started baking\\nbread. I baked so much bread—I have an obsessive personality—that one day somebody brought\\nme to a potter’s house. He said, “If you like that, you’ll like this,” and he was right. This potter\\nwas really old, probably fifty at the time—to me, very old—but it just so happened that he drank\\nespresso and played cribbage. I’m a big game player, so I would go to his place and I would play\\ncribbage with him and I started throwing pots. I really liked it because it was very tactile. I had\\nlearned how to cook and you will find that most potters are good cooks because they are very\\nsimilar acts—they get their hands dirty, they invent things, it’s spontaneous.\\nAW: What was the name of this potter?\\nCMC: His name was Jerry Hollingsworth. I have no idea if he’s still alive. I doubt it. He would\\nbe ninety-five.\\nAW: Is that when you first started working in ceramics?\\nCMC: I started throwing pots and then I moved back to Minnesota unexpectedly because my\\nfather died. I was twenty-three and I felt that I should be near my mother while my mother was\\ngoing through this transition. I didn’t really know what to do in Minneapolis because I had left\\nand I had been living in the mountains and had been living pretty differently than I lived in\\nMinnesota. I lived in places without electricity or plumbing and I didn’t have a car and I didn’t\\nhave a phone and I really didn’t want those things so this was like being in a foreign land\\nbecause it had been what I grew up with but not what my comfort zone was at the time.\\nI decided to go back to school because I had dropped out before I had completed college but I\\nhad already fulfilled all my requirements so I took a pottery course and my teacher ended up\\nbeing my husband. I had never been in an art class. One of your questions on the questionnaire\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n5\\nwas, “Did you grow up with art?” I grew up with maps and shag carpet. So, no, we did not grow\\nup with art or the conversation of art. If it would have come into the house my father would have\\nmade fun out of it. However, my father I actually think that a lot of—I think creativity is really\\nnurtured. I think everybody has it, but people are either given permission by their environment or\\nby themself in retaliation to their environment. My father, even though he was an engineer, he\\nwas very conceptual. I remember studying algebra and I always wanted the answer, and he said,\\n“The answer actually isn’t important, it’s the idea. If you understand the idea then you will\\nalways know the answer; otherwise, answers change.” It was a concept that I couldn’t grasp at\\nthe time but it was something that I learned from him. My mother just had a really interesting\\nsensibility about things but she never took herself seriously. She didn’t have a lot of self-esteem\\nabout her creativity and I think that that’s also something that’s learned. My first husband—who\\nwas my teacher—I worked with him in the beginning as an apprentice and I used to call myself a\\nrookie and he used to say, “If you call yourself a rookie, a rookie is what you will always be.\\nStart considering yourself a professional and you will become one.” He was really—even though\\nI had gone through college and learned about sexism—he was really the first professional that\\ndemanded that I take myself seriously. So I did.\\nAW: Where were you going to school?\\nCMC: University of Colorado.\\nAW: When you were taking this pottery class in Minnesota?\\nCMC: University of Minnesota. I took classes from [Curt Hoard and] Warren [MacKenzie], and\\nI had a polar opposite view of ceramics in Warren’s classes when I did not have any self-confidence.\\nWarren was an advocate for making Japanese pots and English pots and I would\\nalways say, “But why would I make Japanese pots, Warren? I live in Minnesota. I’ve lived in\\nColorado. Why wouldn’t I make something that is an expression of my experience?” Warren is a\\nstoryteller and Warren really fell in love with the story of Michael Cardew and Hamada and\\nBernard Leach and so part of his legacy is to keep that story alive. I come more from—not\\nbecause I was trained that way—it just synergistically made more sense to me to be—it felt more\\nhonest to talk about my own experiences even if they weren’t very meaningful or deep. So that’s\\nwhat I chose to do. I could appreciate—and I still can—the beauty of a lot of that work but I\\ndon’t hold any work as the ultimate work. I like all different kinds of expression. I definitely like\\nShoji Hamada’s work better than Bernard Leach’s.\\nAW: Why is that?\\nCMC: Bernard’s is very, very tight and formal and, in my opinion, unapproachable.\\nAW: Why is that something that you don’t like?\\n00:15:00\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n6\\nCMC: Because I like things the opposite of that. I like organic. I like approachable. I like\\nunpredictable, asymmetrical.\\nAW: What was it like being in class with Warren? Who were some of the other students? Who\\nwere your colleagues at the time, fellow students?\\nCMC: You know I don’t have great recall. A lot of the potters I know now—they were not my\\ncontemporaries in school. Amy Sabrina was but she was younger but, as I said, she died. Gail\\nKendall was a little older. She went on to teach. She’s retired. Paul Dresang—the drill I showed\\nyou—he was a grad student. Ron Gallas was a grad student. Bob Briscoe, I met later. I don’t\\nknow. Also, you know, I was a little older when I went back to school—I was twenty-three—I\\nwas really interested in working because I had been out of school so I was no longer in school to\\nkind of like hang out and meet kids.\\nAW: And where were the art classes being held?\\nCMC: Holman building on the East Bank. It’s now where that fire station—by that fire station.\\nIt’s on University Avenue. It’s been torn down.\\nAW: And what year was this?\\nCMC: This was in 1973, I think, ’72-73.\\nAW: Did you live on campus? Did you live off-campus?\\nCMC: No, I lived on a farm, about forty-five minutes away from the university in Maple Grove.\\nI lived in an old farmhouse. I had a goat shed for a studio. I would drive all of my green ware\\npots into town in my car and fire them at the university.\\nAW: Were there many students in a similar situation or were you in a unique situation there? Did\\nmany students live on campus or live around the urban area or did they also live out beyond the\\nmetro area?\\nCMC: I don’t think that many students did that, no. I lived with a glassblower and his wife. A\\nglassblower that was a grad student and his wife, who were also really into being in the country.\\nAW: Was there a strong sense of community among the students who were involved in the arts\\non campus?\\nCMC: I think that as I grew into becoming a potter—because in those days, it really wasn’t a\\nvocation unless you were a teacher or a production potter. I really didn’t like teaching and I\\nreally also wasn’t a production potter. In those days you did art fairs. Kind of what Bob [Briscoe]\\ndoes, Bob does a little teaching and a little art fairs. I did stuff like that. The sense of community\\nwas hugely strong and hugely unique in that you were almost like relatives that liked each other.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n7\\nYou didn’t have secrets. I remember when I first started getting to know the “art community”—\\nsculptors, painters, people in other mediums—people were really guarded about how they did\\nwhat they did. Potters were not like that. It’s like, if you liked this cup, “Show me how you made\\nthe handle. What’s your glaze?” No one ever said, “I won’t tell you that, that’s my secret thing.”\\nI’m sure there were people like that, but that would have been very uncommon. I don’t think it\\nwas specific to this area but it was really kind of a, you know, help your neighbor, if your barn\\nburns down you all go back and rebuild it. People just helped each other a lot. In that way it was\\na very friendly community.\\nI have a son now who is thirty years old and he went to the Chicago Art Institute for school—\\nwhich is where Warren MacKenzie went—and he graduated about eight or nine years ago and it\\nwas really interesting because we went around the country looking at schools with Wiley. Wiley\\nhad been in art for a long time. He started when he was very young. When we went to look at art\\ndepartments, at this point, people no longer married materials. Even RISD, which started out\\nRhode Island School of Art and Design. When we went to look at it with Wiley, you had to\\ndeclare, Are you a photographer? Are you a sculptor? Are you a weaver? Bang, you know, six\\nweeks in. Two years later, only seven or eight years ago, and definitely an indication of the\\nschool that Wiley went to, you didn’t marry a material. You might be in clay, then you might be\\nin fiber, and then you might be doing something with graphics. Actually, my son Wiley over the\\nyears has encouraged me to exploit that idea. I’ve gone to the New York Studio School twelve\\nyears ago and started doing figurative drawing. I make things out of shells. I make things out of\\nstone. I’m probably the only potter on the Tour that works in a lot of different materials.\\nHowever, when I work in clay, that’s all I work in. Sometimes I bring my drawings to clay. But,\\nI think my son is actually really the cause of a lot of that.\\n00:22:00\\nAW: Does he have a focused art form he does now or does he also work in lots of materials?\\nCMC: He started in photography. He worked in lots of materials. He lived in Berlin for six years.\\nNow he’s working as a creative in a small advertising firm in Minnesota. He adores it and he’s\\nreally good at it.\\nAW: To get back to your family history—you were taking a class with Fuller?\\nCMC: No, no, no. Fuller is not my first husband. My first husband was a man named Curt Hoard\\nand he was a professor at the university, along with Warren. Curt and I got married in 1977 and\\nwe were married for fourteen years. Then I was working with Fuller on a project, and then\\nanother project, and then seven years later we got married.\\nAW: And when about was that?\\nCMC: Fuller and I got married in 1991.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n8\\nAW: I thought I saw 1991 on the bowl by Amy [Sabrina]. [Bowl made by Amy Sabrina for\\nConnee and Fuller].\\nCMC: Correct.\\nAW: I wondered if that was a special date for you both. How did you come to meet Fuller?\\nCMC: Fuller’s mother was an art collector. She was a philanthropist in the community. She was\\non the Board of the Walker Art Center. She came to one of my shows. Fuller went to art school.\\nHe went to Bennington. When he came home on one of his vacations, she wanted him to meet\\nother artists. She brought him over and that’s how I met him.\\nAW: Do you have another son?\\nCMC: I have another son named Westin and those sons are both Curt Hoard’s biological\\nchildren. We’ve all raised them. Curt remains to be our friend. He actually works in my studio.\\nWe have one of those crazy families that everybody was married to someone else. But, we get\\nalong.\\nAW: Curt is still in the area?\\nCMC: Curt is in the area. He works out here and then he lives in Arizona part of the year and\\nlives in Minnesota part of the year.\\nAW: Did you guys work together to do art shows, craft shows and things like that?\\n00:24:48\\nCMC: Curt and I? A little bit, yeah, we did. If our marriage could only have existed in a studio\\nwe would have never been divorced because we got along really well in a studio. My non-artist\\nfriends sometimes look at me and they will say, “It must take so much self-discipline to do what\\nyou do.” And I go, “It does, but the self-discipline comes in leaving the studio, not in staying in\\nthe studio.” It’s really easy once you become an artist to work because it’s sort of a conversation\\nwhere you’re never wrong. If you make a mistake you get to work through the mistake—it’s a\\nchallenge, it’s very satisfying once you figure it out. You can talk to other people. “Why is this\\nblowing up? Why is this running?” But we all have internal conversations—emotionally,\\npsychologically, philosophically—that is always being processed in work. So, if you are terribly\\nsad, if you are overjoyed—your studio is your best friend because it’s your outlet; it’s your\\nconversation piece; it’s your conduit, your work is. Leaving that place—you have to be very\\nintentional about leaving it. It tends to attract—most artists, I would venture to guess—are\\nobsessive compulsive types of people. They like to just work really hard and go do something\\nforever and barely come up for air. I can’t think of one person that’s really an artist that I would\\ncall a serious artist that isn’t like that.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n9\\nAW: Would you kind of say, at the same time, there needs to be a sense of balance?\\nCMC: Depending on how balanced you want to be. There are a lot of fabulous artists that don’t\\nstrive to be balanced and they probably are the best artists. If you study Jackson Pollock, or Pete\\nVoulkos. I mean, Pete Voulkos was an addict. He was an alcoholic. He had some very nasty\\nhabits. Loved people, completely good-hearted and worked all the time. Would you want to be\\nmarried to the guy? No. Was he one of the best artists ever? Yes. You have to make that decision\\nonce you become an artist. How crazy do I want to be? How obsessed do I want to get? It’s a\\nconscious decision.\\nAW: Did you have a point in your life when you came to that decision?\\nCMC: Yeah, definitely.\\nAW: When was that? How did that come about?\\nCMC: I don’t remember exactly. I think that when I was exploring ideas of my subconscious\\nthere was some point where I was like, how crazy do I want to go? Then I kind of very\\nconsciously went, not over the edge of where I don’t know what’s going to happen, which is less\\nbrave, probably. I also had a very conscious decision, probably about ten years ago, so probably\\naround the age of fifty-five, where I was in my studio. My studio is out in the yard. It was eleven\\no’clock in the night and I used to not really work less than twelve hours a day. I would say\\ntwelve hours a day would be an average workday. I remember looking at the light and thinking,\\nI’m really tired. I really don’t want to be doing this. I have a husband in the house that would\\nmuch rather have me be in there with him. He would bring dinner out for me and I would\\nbasically say, “Thank you very much, go away,” so I could get my work done. And I thought,\\nwhy am I doing this? I have done this for thirty years. Do I need to just do this to prove to myself\\nthat I can do it? What’s that about? So, I went in the house and I was like, “You know, I’m just\\nnot going to work at night anymore, because I don’t want to.” But, it took me thirty years to give\\nmyself permission to not do that. I think that there was something about having to work those\\nreally long crazy hours to really take myself—to know that I was serious myself. I think that my\\nwork has always had a lot of ideas that have continued to develop, so I’ve never been self-conscious\\nabout my work not having enough meat to it. I think that I had Peter Voulkos in my\\nstudio a couple of times. I think I was very self-conscious the first time he ever picked up one of\\nmy pots and started to scrutinize it. I was really nervous that it was too pretty. Usually, I’m not\\nso self-conscious about my work.\\n00:30:45\\nAW: This is a good transition. Can you tell us a little bit about your work? What did you start out\\ndoing?\\nCMC: I’ve always made impregnated shapes. I’ve always liked very full shapes, which is why I\\nended up going to a figurative drawing school because I wanted, actually, really voluptuous\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n10\\nwomen—to draw them. I’ve just been attracted to those very kind of bulging, curving shapes.\\nI’ve always, somehow, distorted the shape because I want to invite in touch. When something is\\nperfect people tend to look at it and not to want to get involved in it, or appearing to be perfect. If\\nyou throw something tight and round, there is really no reason to go after it. If it has a dent, if it\\nhas finger marks, to me, it becomes more human. My work is organic. My work, I would\\ndescribe, as having very sensual shapes, and is very gestural. It’s functional. I have not made\\nmany things that are just sculptural. Six years ago I did break my back in an accident and I\\ncouldn’t work for a year. I couldn’t not stop working so I actually—Fuller rigged up a thing so I\\ncould work standing up. It’s the only year in my forty-two years that I’ve hand-built. But I did\\nthat. I started out with stoneware because that’s what everybody threw and then once I saw\\nporcelain, porcelain reminded me of cream cheese, I don’t know. I liked what colors did on\\nporcelain, so I went to porcelain and never looked back. That was thirty-five years ago. Porcelain\\nis temperamental. It’s a little bit of a prima donna. Once you learn—clay has a conversation of\\nits own. Any potter learns that pretty early on that you have to be very intentional about what\\nyou want and then at some point the clay has a voice and you have to be astute enough to listen\\nto that. Usually, a really good piece captures the energy of the clay and your intention.\\nAW: When you were first starting in the seventies, in the U of M classes, how would you\\ndescribe your work then?\\nCMC: Same.\\nAW: Was that common at that time or was that a new approach to pottery? Or did that come\\nthrough Warren’s teaching of function--?\\nCMC: No, it didn’t come through any of their teaching at the time. Warren made brown pots, I\\ndidn’t like brown pots. Curt made low-fired political pots. I didn’t like those either. So, I don’t\\nknow, no. I liked food. My first plate was an homage to cheesecake because I thought\\ncheesecake was almost religious it was so divine and I thought no plate ever did justice to\\ncheesecake, so I made a plate with a Japanese glaze called tenmoku which is a brown-black that\\nWarren uses and the white of the cheesecake just popped off of that rich chocolaty surface. I’ve\\nalways found food to be very sensual and so kind of playing the juxtaposition of color and form\\nagainst the food was really interesting to me. Then as I got more developed I did it with flowers.\\nI love flowers and so lots of times the pots are really interesting when they’re used with\\nsomething.\\n00:35:15\\nAW: When did you start showing your work?\\nCMC: I think I started showing my work in art fairs, probably three or four years after I started\\nmaking work. I did a couple art fairs and then like, you know, high schools or whatever would\\nhave shows and I would have shows like that.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n11\\nAW: Mostly around the Twin Cities or in other--?\\nCMC: Yeah, and there were other places too. I don’t remember.\\nAW: Were you also working at the time?\\nCMC: I taught ceramics. When I first came here I think I waitressed and then after that I knew\\nhow to throw pots well enough that I taught. But I never liked teaching. I did have one\\nexperience teaching that I loved. Minnesota used to have a thing called Percent for Art Program\\nwhere one percent of any budget of a Minnesota state building went for art. These Percent for\\nArt projects were national. Fuller and I did about three of them. One of them that we did was at a\\nwomen’s maximum security prison in Shakopee. This project was probably twelve years ago.\\nYou went in and they wanted something that some of the prisoners would work on. We were\\nelected to go in and we proposed that we would build these very sculptural benches—and I’ll\\nshow you one outside—that they’re kind of very Gaudi-esque, covered with tile. We would have\\nthe women do images on the tile and then we would then cover these benches—skin them\\nessentially—in their artwork.\\nWhen we went into this prison the women made forty cents an hour and they paid them two\\ndollars to come and hear us talk. I remember thinking, That’s humbling, because usually by that\\ntime, if we would go and give a lecture we would be paid a stipend of five hundred dollars or\\nsomething like that—Come speak at our school. They’re being paid five hours worth of work to\\ncome and hear us talk and by the way, that was only two bucks. So, I was like, Okay. We went in\\nand there were like twenty women in the room and I walked up to the front and this huge black\\nwoman sat down next to me and she said, “Honey, there ain’t nothing you got to say that I want\\nto hear.” So they were just there to clock their time. We started talking about the creative\\nprocess, and they were looking really bored. And then we started showing them slides of our\\nwork and then they were more interested because they could tell that we didn’t make little peanut\\ndolls. Then one of them said, “Why would I want to make anything beautiful for this place? I\\nhate this place.” And I said, “Because it’s not about the object, it’s about the process. I don’t\\nmake things for the object. I make things for the process of creating something. Once I have\\nfinished it, I’m finished. It’s done.”\\nPeople always ask me, “How can you sell that?” I’m like, “It’s easy. It’s done. It’s a\\nconversation that I’ve already had.” Then they asked us if we would edit their work and we said,\\n“Yes,” but if anything looked like they made it to please someone else, I would destroy. I said,\\n“It has to come from you because only you have your own set of experiences and if it has that\\nintegrity and that honesty, it is going to be really interesting. We were there for six months. The\\nprison staff thought that we would maybe have two or three people working with us, and we cut\\nthe class off at forty-five. We worked there for six months, and we had amazing experiences and\\nthey made amazing things. We had critiques. In the last critique, everybody was talking about\\ntheir experiences in the class—now, understand that these are women that half of them have\\nmurdered somebody. They were drug dealers. They were prostitutes. They were child abusers.\\nThey were hardcore criminals.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n12\\nThe reason why I loved it as a teacher is because lots of times if you go in and teach a class, you\\nknow, you’re there to make a casserole for your mother for Mother’s Day. It’s really boring for\\nme as a teacher and I am not generous of heart enough to get excited about your mother’s\\ncasserole. I just really don’t give a shit. These women—no one had ever said to them, “Who are\\nyou? Why do you think the way you think? Show me.” That is something that is a luxury and for\\nthat conversation to even be respected. Before I walked into that prison I never realized that there\\nwere people like that and then what happens if, when you’re two, you’re forced to drink alcohol\\nto go to sleep, or you’re sexually abused, or you’re beaten. What does that tell you? So they had\\na lot to express in their work if you can well imagine. In our final critique I just said, “Here’s\\nwhat I learned, that sitting at this table with you forty women, you are no different than any of\\nmy girlfriends with the exception of one thing. You were told you were a piece of shit when you\\nwere two, and I was told I could be anything I want to be. That’s the difference and that’s the\\nonly difference. You can go forward from this point on, giving yourself value, giving your\\nexperiences some credibility because of the knowledge that you have, because of the path that\\nyou have, and maybe you can’t go outside and ride a bike but there are a lot of women who live\\nin two million dollar houses in Edina that are in prison, but they’re not aware of the prison that\\nthey’re in or, maybe, they’re aware of it, but it doesn’t have bars and it’s not so easy. You can be\\nin prison, but you can be free.”\\nThat teaching experience—it’s a really roundabout way—they were hungry, they were honest,\\nthey had a ton of integrity, and it was a huge turn-on to me. Teachers are giving, giving, giving\\nand I get drained. I need an exchange.\\n00:43:40\\nAW: Is that the only One Percent project you did? You said you did a couple others?\\nCMC: Yes, we did one for City Hall in [Vadnais Heights, and a big project in Anoka metro\\ntreatment center.]\\nAW: Actually, before you get to that and following up on this story—are there any pieces that\\nstick in your mind about working with the female prisoners—any pieces that still stick in your\\nmind today, because of the story or the piece itself?\\nCMC: Any pieces—you mean objects?\\nAW: Yes, pieces—were they creating their own individual pieces?\\nCMC: Well, they were carving in wood and making blocks to print. Were there any objects? No,\\nthe experience has stuck with me, hugely. It was one of the most magnificent privileges that I\\never had was being in a situation where we could all grow so much. Also, the unifying factor in\\nthat prison that we experienced was being creative because the lesbians hated the straights, the\\nwhites hated the blacks, everybody hated the Indians, the prostitutes hated the drug dealers, the\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n13\\nmurderers hated everybody else. They all had issues. When they walked into the art room, it all\\nstayed outside. The first day the Indian woman said to me, “Why are you playing their music?” I\\nwas playing Aretha Franklin. I said, “It’s great music.” It was their music. Two months later that\\nIndian woman was teaching a black woman to carve. It broke down these stereotypes of, Well, I\\ndon’t like you, you have thick hair, I have thin hair, I want your hair, I don’t like you—whatever\\nreasons people come up with to shut people out. It was a very inclusive experience. It was\\nwonderful.\\nAW: You said that you started out with about forty-five students or so—so they kept coming\\nback, the same students each time?\\nCMC: Yeah, but they kept bringing people and finally we had to stop it because it just got too\\nbig for us to manage. The prison guards hated us and they could not wait for our project to be\\nfinished.\\nAW: Why was that?\\nCMC: Because we were promoting creativity instead of shame and retribution and, “Confess\\nyour sins and maybe some day you will be redeemed.” We didn’t do that.\\nAW: What did women say when you were telling them, “There is no difference here?”\\nCMC: You know, we’re walking into people’s lives who have had a pattern of twenty, thirty,\\nforty years and we’re there for six months. All we can do is plant a seed. I think we made a big\\ndifference. What were their reactions? One of the times that we went out there—you know, it\\nwas two hours of a drive for us to go there, so it was four hours for us to go work there. We left\\nat six-thirty in the morning to get there and you have to volunteer on a sheet that you’re going to\\ncome and they were going to come work with us. We got out there; no one was there. You can’t\\ncall them. On the phone you send, I forgot what it was called, a kite? Anyway, about an hour\\nlater these four women come dragging in. These women all have killed people. Some of them\\noutweighed me four times. I was just like them when I was like with anybody else. I was like,\\n“Where the fuck have you been? I have been waiting here for two hours.” I was pissed off, which\\nis why I’m not a good teacher. It’s like, you ask me to be involved, I’m there. But if you’re not,\\ndon’t waste my time. So, I was there, they were like, “Well, I didn’t feel like it.” “You didn’t feel\\nlike it? Well, maybe I didn’t feel like getting up at six-thirty in the morning.” But what I learned,\\nagain, was that was my training. You are your word. They didn’t have that training. That wasn’t\\npart of their upbringing. You either showed up because you were going to get punished if you\\ndidn’t, or you were going to get rewarded. That’s why you showed up. Not because I said, “I’ll\\nbe there.” That’s my middle-class white upbringing: be your word. So all those kinds of lessons\\nwere really in my face.\\nWhen you’re an artist you learn humility in a lot of ways. When I was actually in the New York\\nStudio School, I went to the school, and after I went to the school I worked with one of the\\nexpressionists that was one of my teachers. I just worked with her. I went to New York to work\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n14\\nwith her. I went to one of her night classes one time. There was this ninety year-old woman in\\nthe night class and the class was like fifteen students big. The teacher’s name was Ofra and\\nOfra—she was from Israel—and she said, “Connee, come over here, I want you to look at\\nIngrid’s work.” I walked to the other side of the room. It was naïve painting and it was really\\ngreat. And I said, “This is great.” This woman, she said, “You have such beautiful hair.” And\\nI’m like, “Thank you.” And I hear one of the students go, “Shh! Shh!” and they’re drawing a\\nmodel. And I said, “This is really great and this painting, what is this about?” And she goes,\\n“Your skin is so soft, my dear.” And then again the, “Shh! Shh!” And I said, “Well, I better go to\\nthe other side of the room. Thank you for letting me see your work.” And so I go back to where\\nI’m painting. At the end of the night I go have a coffee with Ofra. She said, “What did you think\\nof my class?” I said, “I think your students are assholes.” I said, “I think if they want to be artists,\\nthey first have to learn how to be human beings.” So, she goes and tells them the next day, “My\\nfriend says if you want to be an artist,”—because that was the part of being in art school that I\\nreally hated—being old. It’s like, I forget what it’s like to be twenty and you want to be an artist\\nand you have to wear certain clothes, and you have to wear your hair a certain way, and you have\\nto have piercings and tattoos—there’s like, this image. You don’t care about these images if you\\nhave been doing something for a long time. You’re not self-conscious in that way. To me, the\\nfact this old woman was in this painting class, spewing her guts out in painting, and then this\\nyoung woman was so intolerant of the fact that she was deaf and talked really loudly—I had no\\ntime for that. If I would have been the teacher I would have told her to leave the room. That’s\\nhow intolerant I am. But, you know, humility? Yes. Tolerance? I don’t know. [Laughs]\\n00:52:00\\nAW: I think you make a really important point here. You’ve been in so many different classroom\\nsituations, or educational institutions, to see over time how students respond in the moment of\\nlearning and practicing art and then coming to this situation where this woman was trying to\\nmake a connection with you and taking the time to allow that to happen--\\nCMC: --But that will happen in any school. That will happen in a university. I’ve taught in a\\nuniversity classroom where there is some Russian woman who is elderly and taking a night class\\nand will work for two months on a project and then a football player turns in a project that he’s\\nbeen working on for two months. He made his in ten minutes. She made hers in two months. But\\nhe happens to be really good looking and a football star, and in the critique, he will start to give\\nthis spiel about all of the heavy meaning of this thing. And I will go, “Really? Does that work for\\nyou? Where does that work for you—in the backseat of a car or on the football field? It doesn’t\\nwork in an art class. And you are insulting me and everybody else by trying to pretend that is\\nanything other than a total turd sitting on the table.” I don’t know that I could be a teacher\\nbecause I would probably get into a lot of trouble because I’d be like the temp at the time,\\n“Whoa, don’t bring her back really soon.” Bob Briscoe loves me because I am very candid. I’m\\nnot mean spirited, I just don’t hang out in places I don’t want to be, even if it’s a conversation.\\nAW: It seems from this conversation that art is more than, like you said, it’s not about the final\\nproduct, it’s about the process—it’s about connecting with other people--\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n15\\nCMC: --And if you were to ask me about being an artist I would tell you—you are asking me\\nabout being an artist? I am telling you that if you walk into the door of my studio and you say,\\n“I’m here to buy a teapot,” I will look at you and go, It’s not about the teapot. Why has this\\nperson come into my life? The teapot is merely the conduit, it’s merely the vessel. It’s my\\nconduit of a conversation that somebody is going to all of a sudden respond to or not. I have a\\nbetter chance of them responding to it if I can get them to touch the work. So, then, the fact that\\nonly one of ten thousand people walk into my studio? That’s fine with me. I don’t need\\neverybody to walk into my studio and go, “Love this.” Don’t want that. No, it’s not true. Not\\ntrying to do that.\\n00:55:25\\nAW: You were telling us about when Peter Voulkos came into your studio. Can you tell us more\\nabout him? When we first arrived you showed us one of his artworks. How did you come to\\nknow about him and his work? What has he meant in your art?\\nCMC: I think that he is probably, to me, one of the most important contemporary ceramists\\nbecause I think he really revolutionized the material and the context of what it’s always been\\nheld in. He brought it out of being functional where it doesn’t need to be functional. He brought\\nthe conversation into the fact that you can talk about the idea of a vessel. It doesn’t have to hold\\ncoffee or flowers to be valid. But it can be valid if it holds coffee or flowers. So, even though I\\ndon’t make brown pots like Mack [Warren MacKenzie] does, I also don’t make pots like Pete\\ndoes. I don’t make plates that you put on the wall. My plates—you can serve food from. I like\\nthe functionality and I love the marriage of food and pots of flowers. I love ritual. I love creating\\na setting. I think that you can do all of that with the pottery. How did I feel about Pete? He was\\nsort of a bigger than life teacher. He would come in to do workshops. He was fueled by students.\\nHe loved teaching and he is such a rough and ready teacher. He’d be drinking Jack Daniels and\\nsitting down at a wheel, throwing pots. This is not my style. I don’t know that I was in awe of his\\npersonal choices, but I was in awe of the work that he created and the energy he brought to the\\nwork. The honesty of the work. The integrity of the work. The way he pushed clay around.\\nAmazing.\\nAW: Can you tell us a little bit more about where he was practicing and how--?\\nCMC: He lived in Berkeley and he taught at—where did he teach? I don’t know. You could look\\nit up.\\nAW: And how did you come in contact with him?\\nCMC: In the world of clay there are these big conferences. We used to have a conference called\\nSuper Mud. There is something called NCECA—National Council on Education for the Ceramic\\nArts—you know, these big conferences and they would always have these superstars that are like\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n16\\nshowing work, demoing work. I think the first time I met Pete was at one of those kinds of\\nthings.\\nAW: Why was he out here?\\nCMC: He came here—the Art Institute had him do something. Because Curt was a professor,\\nlots of times if there was a visiting artist, they would end up at our house. I don’t know, you just,\\nit’s a small world. You know those people. Good friends of mine, Bob Brady and Sandy Simon,\\nlive in Berkeley. They’re both ceramists. They have a gallery. I would go to Berkeley to visit\\nthem and then we would go to Pete’s studio and see him.\\nAW: When you were recalling that moment when he first came in and he was holding one of\\nyour pots—did you guys strike up a conversation?\\nCMC: Oh, I wanted to die. It would be like Gandhi looking at your philanthropic project. It was\\njust like, are you kidding me? He was like, “Oh, tell me about this.” And I was like, “There’s\\nnothing much to say!” I was just ridiculous. I wanted him to leave. [Laughs].\\n01:00:10\\nAW: That’s a lot of pressure.\\nCMC: Yeah, I just wanted him out of there. I think I was just way too self-conscious.\\nAW: But it sounds like you continued to go and visit him in his studio and--\\nCMC: Yeah, it wasn’t that often. I probably was at his studio maybe three or four times and he\\nwas at our place a couple of times and then just in different public things a few times. Probably\\nfifteen times, you know, would run into him. He was more a hero than a contemporary.\\nDefinitely wasn’t a contemporary.\\nAW: Who were some other inspiring artists?\\nCMC: The first one that pops into my mind is Philip Glass, who is a musician.\\nAW: Why is he inspiring to you?\\nCMC: I don’t know. He just takes me away to another world that I’m comfortable in and\\nchallenges me. I love Picasso’s paintings. I love Dubuffet--sculpture. I like Diana Arbus’\\nphotographs.\\nAW: Did you happen to see the exhibit of her work—was that a couple of years ago—at the\\nWalker?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n17\\nCMC: Uh-huh, yeah.\\nAW: What is it about her photography that is interesting to you?\\nCMC: She catches contradiction. I love juxtaposition. I like putting something precious with\\nsomething completely banal. She taught me a different way of looking at people. You know, you\\nlook at a face in any of her photographs and if you cover up half the face you see one thing and if\\nyou cover up the other half you see something totally different. You see that when you paint\\nfaces.\\nAW: When we first came in you were showing us some of the works of Peter’s students over the\\nyears. Can you tell us more about those pieces and artists?\\nCMC: Jun Kaneko. He lives in Lincoln, Nebraska. To me, Jun is about pattern and making\\npattern a painting, and because it’s in glaze it’s more volatile than oil or anything else. Also, the\\nscale that he works at—although not everything that Jun makes, I love—but that’s true of most\\nartists. His work is very different than Pete’s, but again, I really respect things when they have a\\nlot of integrity and they are more of a conversation about what that artist is thinking about or\\ndiscovering than about knowing where their influences come from. You know, if you look at a\\npainting and go, Well, that person loved Francis Bacon. If you immediately jump to a famous\\nartist when you look at work, I think it’s less interesting. There’s an old saying that “Amateurs\\nborrow and professionals steal.” Nothing is original but people will have an idea enough where\\nit’s not reminding you of something else. Akiyo, again, he’s very painterly. He’s into eroticism\\nbut not in a way that’s so in your face. It’s sort of playful and I am just attracted to it.\\n01:05:15\\nAW: Have you met Jun and Akiyo?\\nCMC: Hmm-mm.\\nAW: What was it like meeting them?\\nCMC: Pete was my favorite. I mean Jun and Akiyo are both Japanese so they’re much more\\nreserved. Pete was just out there and he was great.\\nAnother man that I think was very influential for me was a guy named Jim Melchert, and I’ll\\nshow you his work. Jim Melchert—even though, again, he’s in his eighties and he’s a Berkeley\\nartist—he’s so conceptual, and he’s so intrigued with the idea—for many years he made\\nsituations rather than objects. He came into the University of Minnesota forty years ago and did a\\nworkshop with all the art students and brought everybody out of their comfort zone. “You know\\nAndy because she is a History major. Where are your grandparents from?” All of a sudden I’m\\nlooking at you as Irish or whatever you are. Jim Melchert said to everybody, “Everybody in this\\nroom does something really well other than their art. As a matter of fact you do it so well you\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n18\\nprobably don’t even know what it is, but I want you to come back in three days and show\\neveryone what it is.” Thirty-five years later anybody that was in that room can tell you what\\neverybody did. Or he would have us--\\nAW: --What did you do?\\nCMC: What did I do? I can do tricks with my spit. I can blow bubbles with spit and also if I eat\\nsomething sour I can gleek—I can open my mouth and fountains of spit come out like this. So I\\ncame in sunglasses and I blew bubbles and then I bit into a lemon and then I gleeked. That was\\nwhat I did.\\nOne of the kids in there was a thief who was a student. He stole things from all these different\\npeople that were in the workshop and then brought them into the workshop. You know, the\\nsculpture teacher’s screen door, the distributor cap, the mailbox, he just went around and then\\nbrought them all in. The sculpture teacher who always yelled at everyone had studied Native\\nAmerican dance his whole life and put on this big feather thing and did all this dance. My\\nfavorite was a woman who was much older than the rest of us—she was probably forty—and she\\nlooked like she would sell Tupperware—all of her clothes matched—and she said, “What I do\\nwell is I cope. And while I cope, I peel grapefruit.” And she brought in this bowl of grapefruit\\nand she took a knife and she went, “chk, chk, chk, chk, chk, chk,” and she peeled this entire\\ngrapefruit in one piece and then went, “poh, poh, poh, poh,” and all the membranes came out.\\nAnd she goes, “Okay, tell me your problems.” You felt like you were at her kitchen table.\\nSomeone went, “Well, my seventeen year old wants her boyfriend to sleep over. What do I do?”\\nShe goes, “Well,” and she picks up a grapefruit. It was like, wow. It was so much fun but it’s like\\nwhen you’re in art, these little snippets are so interesting. That woman was like a living\\nperformance piece. That was so creative what she was doing. But our society might say, “Well,\\nyou have to be this important painting to be creative.” No, actually, not true. It’s just wedding\\nthat that can kind of set off all these different things. Jim Melchert, oh, he did it in spades. He\\nwould say, “Go away with your little group and create a pantomime that’s a lie and a truth. Come\\nback in an hour and show it to the group.” “Go away and create a kinetic sculpture with your\\nshadow.” You know, so you’re always looking at your body, you’re not looking at what your\\nbody does out here other than when you’re walking down the street you might go, Look at how\\nlong my shadow is, but you’re never thinking about how your shadows might build and move\\nthings with each other. He just got you aware of your expectations. Even being aware of your\\nexpectations can feed into the world of creativity, in a way. What’s fabulous about being an\\nartist, being a potter, is we’re always changing. We change everyday. Our career—it’s a venue\\nfor that. It doesn’t fight against that. It’s very exciting to be in life, and when you are in a\\ncreative expression—it doesn’t matter what it is, you can be a writer—you can always feed it.\\nYou always have a venue for it, and that’s really a luxury, a huge luxury.\\n[AUDIO NOTE: Rain begins. Not too loud but sounds like static.]\\n01:11:02\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n19\\nAW: When did you decide that you wanted to make this a career? Or did you ever decide that or\\ndid it just kind of evolve?\\nCMC: I think it evolved. I don’t think that I decided I wanted to make it a career. When I was in\\nhigh school you took a test and my test said I should be a forest ranger. I think that just living in\\nthe mountains and being exposed to a potter and it was very tactile and then going to classes,\\ngoing to an art fair—it just sort of evolved. Oh, you can actually make money doing this, you\\nreally can’t make enough money doing this, you have to teach. All of that. Young potters come\\nup to me and say, “How do you make this a career?” I think it’s something that you feed from\\nthe inside out rather than the outside in. You let things evolve, you notice that they’re evolving,\\nand then you push it, rather than, I want to be a fireman, I’ll go train. But then when you start to\\ndefine what you do you do have to push it, you have to work on it. Oh, I’m going to do this—\\nthen you have to do it.\\nAW: How did you start doing it in those early years?\\nCMC: I don’t know. I just started working more and more. I liked teaching less and less. I taught\\nfor five or six years. I didn’t really like doing that. And then--\\nAW: --Mostly at the U [University of Minnesota]?\\nCMC: No, I taught at a community center. The only reason why I taught at the U is because I\\nwould substitute teach. Or, I would teach workshops, but I didn’t really like that. I think that\\nafter awhile you start getting a group of people that start liking your work. I started self-producing\\nshows. I used to be in a lot of shows and then I stopped doing that. I used to be in a lot\\nof galleries. I stopped doing that.\\nAW: What was your family’s response once you started producing a lot, doing shows, what was\\nyour mother’s response?\\nCMC: My father had died. My father died when I was very young before I did any of this. My\\nmother was basically very disapproving. My mother thought I was giving a huge disservice to\\nmy husband for having a job and also to my children. Whenever I would have shows and my\\nmother would come she would say, “Well, of course I’m so proud of my daughter.” Really it was\\nout of my mother’s comfort zone and also I don’t think that my mother ever really could invest\\nin me in a way other than how she thought I might be, which was not the way I was. So no, I\\ndidn’t have my mother’s approval.\\nAW: What about your siblings?\\nCMC: No, not really. I shouldn’t say that. My brother, yes, but I could do anything and my\\nbrother would think it was cool. My sister and I were always just opposites and still are. She’s\\nvery good hearted, but my sister loves raw steak and male strippers. I’m a vegetarian and like\\npottery. Just really different people.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n20\\n01:15:15\\nAW: Do they live here in Minnesota?\\nCMC: My sister lives in L.A. and my brother lives in Dallas, Texas.\\nAW: Over time did your mother change her views?\\nCMC: No, she even felt stronger that it was selfish.\\nAW: What did that mean for you as you were working?\\nCMC: Nothing, no. I stopped trying to seek my mother’s approval quite early on.\\nAW: When you were raising your kids—how did you teach them about art? What were the\\nfamily conversations around art and what it means?\\nCMC: My children have always grown up with art. My children have always grown up with\\nparents that work a lot. They are both in very creative fields. One is in wine and the other is in\\nadvertising. My children grew up, I think, knowing that if you love something, you’ll be really\\ngood at it, and if you work really hard at it, all the better. And you have to work at something\\nthat regenerates energy so you can’t go work on an island in a room with a door that’s closed.\\nThey’re very creative. They’re very personable. I think they could do anything.\\nAW: I think that’s a really important message to learn early on, having the opportunity to do\\nanything you want. I like what you said about art that it regenerates energy. It’s something that\\nyou give and get. Let’s shift gears a little bit and talk about how you got to the St. Croix River\\nValley area. When did you decide to move to the area?\\nCMC: I didn’t. I actually married Fuller and Fuller had this house, and that was in ’91 and I think\\nI first came out here in 1990. When did the pottery tour start?\\nAW: I’m just drawing a blank at the moment. I think this year was the twenty-second year?\\nCMC: Or, twenty-first, I don’t know. I was not in it the first year. I was in it the second year and\\nit was because of Bob Briscoe. I lived here. Bob and I were both on the advisory board of the\\nNorthern Clay Center. We were part of the initial team in starting that. We are very like in kind\\nthinkers. I’m very opinionated. Bob wanted me to be part of this group. I’m not much of a group\\nperson, but I went, “Sure.” Over the years Bob’s had to calm me down and keep me in it. There\\nare times when I don’t want to be in it. Whenever it started, I did it the second year.\\nAW: Why did you want to be part of it? In the second year I think still there was a lot to be\\nfigured out.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n21\\nCMC: There were like thirty or forty people who came. Why did I want to be in it? I just did it\\nbecause Bob wanted me to.\\nAW: How did you get to know Bob?\\nCMC: I don’t remember. Just through the clay community, clay world. When we were on the\\nadvisory board of Northern Clay I think is when I really learned a lot about him because you\\nheard what people fought for and that’s when I started liking him a lot. He’s a very community\\nminded, very generous guy. He really thinks about how is this going to affect the whole. How\\ncan we make that happen. There are a lot of people who are on the pottery tour who just do not\\nhave that kind of vision.\\n01:20:15\\nAW: Why do you think he has that vision?\\nCMC: Drinks a lot of beer, I don’t know (laughs)\\nAW: Just to back up—before you moved here were you living in Minneapolis?\\nCMC: Yes, yes. I lived in St. Anthony Park. I lived in a converted fire station. Half of it was my\\nstudio and half of it was our house.\\nAW: Did you buy it that way or did you set it up?\\nCMC: No, I bought it as a fire station and converted it. I bought it from the city in 1979.\\nAW: Was it difficult to have a ceramics studio in the city?\\nCMC: Mm-hmm.\\nAW: What were some of the issues or challenges?\\nCMC: You don’t want to know. [Laughs]. It was really finding a building that you could have\\na—I had a hundred cubic foot gas kiln in the building and so it was finding a building that was\\nconducive to that within the city borders. That building happened to be on a busy street, so it was\\nbordering commercial but it was in residential. It could be split. I was looking for old grocery\\nstores in Northeast and this building came up. I was looking for an odd building that I could\\nmake a studio/house.\\nAW: You said you were in St. Anthony Park then. What was that area like in the Eighties?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n22\\nCMC: It’s not that different than it is now. St. Anthony Park is a lot of university people. The fire\\nstation is in South St. Anthony Park, so it’s more working class. It’s just like a little bridge that\\nseparates the college world from the working-class world. And I was on the edge of the working-class\\nworld. I actually loved it. There was a park right in front of the house. There was a co-op\\nkiddy corner. It was a great place to have a house and a studio.\\nAW: Were there many fellow artists or colleagues around the area?\\nCMC: No, but now it’s becoming actually a corridor for artists. There was a co-op called Film in\\nthe Cities that was two blocks away. That doesn’t exist anymore, but that was the only other arts\\nthing. Northern Clay ended moving there and then they moved away. Joe Brown has a gallery\\nthere—Raymond Street Gallery.\\nAW: When you met Fuller and you moved out here—what were you thinking at the time?\\nCMC: I can have a compost. I like being in the country. I like being in nature.\\nAW: You were excited to be here then?\\nCMC: I like New York City. If I’m going to be in a city I want it to be a city. I like it to be a lot\\nof action and really fast or things I’m not familiar with. Or, I like to wake up to animal sounds, to\\ngardens, to a place to put my banana peels. I like the serenity. Also, I don’t want people visiting\\nme. If you’re in a studio and you come to chat, I can’t work. I want to work.\\nAW: This is such a beautiful setting. Did you, together, design parts of this house and also the\\ngardens?\\nCMC: Yeah.\\nAW: Fuller helped start the Franconia Sculpture Park. Was that already up and running when\\nyou moved here?\\nCMC: I don’t know how old that is. It’s maybe twenty years old. Fuller and his college\\nroommate started it.\\n01:25:15\\nAW: Was there a kind of metal sculpture community here as well as ceramics?\\nCMC: No, nothing. They started with the idea that it would be like a living workshop for young\\nsculptors to come in, to have a venue to show their work. For two years you could come and you\\ncould participate, you could be a student, you could work with the sculptors that were on site.\\nAfter two years you could take your work away, destroy it, if it sells, fine, you get the money.\\nIt’s always been free. That’s pretty much the way it’s run.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n23\\nAW: When you first came here was there a strong sense of community amongst potters? Were\\nthere many potters in the area?\\nCMC: Was there a strong sense of community among potters? I would say no. I think that Bob\\nBriscoe—that line, that connection, Mack [Warren MacKenzie] was part of it in the beginning.\\nYou could draw a line—Warren, Jeff Oestreich, Bob, myself. I think Linda Christianson was in\\nit. There was another guy, Richard Abnet, who died.\\nIn terms of the pottery tour, there are a lot of potters who have hence moved up in this way and\\nthey all want to be part of this tour. We’re actually very guarded about not making it too big\\nbecause it’s already quite a lot of work to get to all the studios. People copy our logo. They name\\ntheir name similar to our name. It’s really kind of ridiculous. That’s not in the spirit of how\\npotters work. I don’t like that. Why not define yourself in a different way? In the meantime, this\\npottery tour, which I’m sure that Bob could tell you much more about, has really been a model\\nfor a lot of pottery tours around the country.\\nOne of the things that we do that I feel very strongly about is we have a philanthropic corner to\\nthe Tour where we give a small amount of money to something that is promoting ceramics.\\nAlthough, this can be a controversial issue. It started out where we gave five percent of\\neverything that we made. When people started making a lot of money they started looking at the\\ncheck they were writing and going, “I’m not rich. Why am I writing such a big check?” We had\\ndiscussions, “Well, it’s sort of like taxes. You’re writing a big check because you’re all of\\nsudden making a lot of money.” The correlation just broke down. So instead we set a set amount\\nof money that the pottery tour would give every year.\\nAW: What were some of the organizations that you’ve given money to?\\nCMC: We’ve given to the Weisman Museum. We’ve given to the Rochester Art Center. We’ve\\ngiven to Northern Clay Center. We’ve given to different local schools to build their ceramics\\nprograms. We’ve given to Potters for Peace. We have a list that you could look at.\\nAW: How do you guys decide?\\nCMC: We have a meeting and vote.\\nAW: Has there been an organization or cause that you were really passionate about donating to\\nover the years?\\nCMC: Me personally, I’m interested in organizations that have the biggest outreach. I’m much\\nmore interested in a museum or university program where it’s going to have a big domino effect\\nthan a little country school where you’re going to affect twenty students. But I think that they’re\\nboth important. I think our tour has a big effect on the little country school that has twenty\\nstudents because they come here en masse and the students all sit around and, you know, their\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n24\\nsenior project is find out why Connee is a potter? They’re little sponges at that age. They want to\\nknow. They don’t know what they want to do.\\n01:30:25\\nAW: Have you worked with local students?\\nCMC: No, I don’t work with anybody. I work with Brenda who you met, who worked on a farm.\\nI mean, yes, in my life have I worked with students? Yes.\\nAW: Can you tell me a little bit more about those first years when you guys were developing the\\nTour? How did you get it up and running?\\nCMC: I think, actually, for those questions, other people will be more helpful. I don’t know that I\\npay attention to it. Bob would be the quintessential person to look at. I think Linda also would be\\nhelpful and Guillermo will have big opinions about that. I think Jeff will kind of go, I don’t\\nknow, and I’m sort of like that. I think it just evolved. Bob was always thinking about ways to\\nget bigger audiences. I know that Bob and I made a big push to put it on public radio a few years\\nago, which we finally did because everybody tended to not want to ever pay money for any\\nadvertising. One of the intentions is to keep the costs of it really low for the participating artists.\\nI think one of the beauties of the Tour is that we create the space for each studio to operate the\\nway they want to independently. We have general parameters—I think you can’t have more than\\neight or nine artists so that it doesn’t get too enormous so there’s not thirty people at one studio\\nand two at another. But, you don’t have to have visiting artists if you don’t want to. Another\\nmust do is that anybody that’s showing in the studio tour has to be there. I think that’s a really\\ngood rule. I lots of times will invite people from California and they will say, “Well we can send\\nwork.” And I’ll say, “No, you have to be there.” Part of the idea is our old fashioned notion of\\nwhat potters do and what they are. It’s nice to meet the maker. I don’t know that painters would\\never have a criteria like that—at a painting show, the painters have to be there. Maybe they’d\\nsay, “It’s nice, maybe they’ll sell more work.” But here, it’s required.\\nAW: Do you think that that sets the Tour apart from other tours?\\nCMC: I don’t know. I don’t know how other tours operate. I don’t know if other tours require\\nthat or not. We require that we give money to a non-profit, that’s another requirement. Generally,\\nit’s required that it is about functional pottery. It gets a little furry because I paint. I will show\\npaintings next to the pot because they’re definitely in relationship. Sometimes the paintings are\\non the pots. So whether it’s 2D or 3D, you know, I think it’s silly to differentiate. Fuller and I\\ncollaborate and do glass and metal chandeliers. We’ll make a piece like that where that has clay\\nin it, Fuller did the metalwork and I’ll show that at the show. We’ll do a chandelier like that and\\nit’s metalwork like that and we’ve commissioned a glass blower to make stems of glass—I won’t\\nshow that in the show because it doesn’t have anything to do with clay. It’s not a hard and fast\\nline. Will Swanson’s wife does this carving called Netsuke which is like these little wood, very\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n25\\nelaborate things. Even though she’s not advertised her work is shown in the Tour. I think it\\nmakes it interesting. We don’t advertise Netsuke as part of what this is. We want it to be simple.\\nWe want it to be about pots.\\nThere’s also really different set-ups. The way I set up my studio and this again, I really like that\\nyou can set up the studio the way you want. I have seven artists. Everybody has their own space\\nor their own tent. You go see, you know, this is Liz’s work, this is Mark’s work, this is Curt’s\\nwork. Guillermo takes all of his artists and puts out fifteen tables and mixes them all up. That’s\\nmuch more of a Warren MacKenzie idea—it doesn’t matter who made it. My idea is if you see\\nfifty pieces of somebody’s work you’re going to understand their work a lot more than if it’s all\\nmixed up. It is going to be hard for you to really go, “Oh, now I can identify the work.” I like\\nthat continuity. I also like to invite the same artists back because they build up a clientele. My\\nartists lots of time are coming from far away. If they’re driving all the way from the East Coast\\n,and if somebody is looking at a piece of Liz’s or Shoko’s and they go, “Well, I thought about it\\nand this year I’m ready to buy something.” That’s very true for me and my clients. They’ll walk\\nin and see a set of dishes and go, “Wow,” and two years later they’re ordering them. They don’t\\nthe first time they see them.\\n01:37:00\\nAW: How do you come to select your guest artists? How do you decide?\\nCMC: A lot of people write to us. A lot of people that are teachers send images on the computer,\\n“Look at this person’s work.” I look at work when I’m out and about to see what I like. I write\\ndown a name if it seems interesting and then I’m very limited to the number of people. Also, I\\nmight like one piece that they make but then I look at twenty different pieces and the piece that I\\nsaw might be the only thing that I like. Or, it doesn’t matter what they make it all looks like—the\\ncup looks like the vase looks like the casserole and then I’m bored so then I’m like, “No.” I’m\\nlooking for somebody—in this studio all of my artists have very individualistic styles which I\\nthink are quite painterly or sculptural, but definitely conceptual.\\nAW: Can you give us an example of one of your guest artists and why you selected them?\\nCMC: Mark Pharis. His pieces are very architectural. You don’t look at one of his vases and go,\\n“Oh, daisies would look pretty in that.” You see the form and the form is very strong and the\\nform is accentuated by the way it is glazed. It’s not like, Oh I have fifty pieces, dunk them all in\\nyellow. You know, Jenny Mendes—they are little stories, paintings. They’re paintings on clay.\\nAW: Which guest artist has been with you the longest?\\nCMC: Amy died. Gail Kendall isn’t there any more. Let me think. Maybe Liz Quackenbush?\\nLiz, Shoko, Jenny, Ani, Mark, Curt. Liz Quackenbush.\\nAW: When did she join?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n26\\nCMC: I don’t know, maybe twelve years ago or something? She was a student of Gail Kendall’s\\nwho was one of my visiting artists who was showing with me up until two years ago. Gail\\nKendall has been a friend for forty years. Curt Hoard I was married to. Jenny Mendes—I bought\\nsome of her work at a show in Chicago twenty years ago and is one of the only artists whose\\nwork that I own that I had never had met her. Bob said, “Would you be interested in her being in\\nthe Tour?” And I said, “Yeah.” That’s how I met Jenny and Jenny brought Shoko. Ani Kasten,\\nthat’s the woman that does that very volatile stuff under the lilacs [refers to piece in her\\ncollection], that actually was a Bob Briscoe, “There’s an artist named Ani Kasten and I think\\nyou’d really like her work.” But you have to know that Bob sends me twenty images like that.\\nWhen I saw Ani’s work I‘m like, Absolutely, and I called her that minute. I said, “Do you want\\nto do it?” She said, “I don’t know,” and she called me back after making ten phone calls and\\nsaid, “Yes,” because we get a million people who want to do this.\\nAW: Do you have some criteria involved that you’ve developed or just kind of an instinct--?\\nCMC: No, it’s just an instinct. Ani’s work has a lot of integrity to it. I loved that about it. I love\\nthe honesty of it. I love the integrity of it.\\n01:41:45\\nAW: Where are your guest artists from? Are they from all over or from Minnesota?\\nCMC: Hmm-mm, all over.\\nAW: Where are some of the places? You said some on the East Coast--?\\nCMC: Liz is from Pennsylvania. Shoko is from North Carolina, I think. Jenny is from Virginia,\\nsomewhere on the East Coast. Mark is from Wisconsin, somewhere. Liz, Mark, Connee, Curt is\\nfrom Minneapolis. Shoko, Ani, Jenny—that’s it.\\nAW: Where is Ani from?\\nCMC: Somewhere on the East Coast, New York maybe?\\nAW: When you’re setting up for the Tour do you have any traditions? What is it like here?\\nCMC: What is it like here? We are preparing. We make black bean soup for about two thousand\\npeople. We do that before the artists come. Just stock the house with groceries and order the tents\\nand make sure the tents are set up. I require that all my artists come in by Wednesday unless\\nthey’re local then Thursday—I want everybody set up by Thursday morning, Thursday at noon.\\nThe Tour starts Friday morning but I run that the same way I have a party. I don’t like things\\ndone at the last minute. So lots of times we are walking around to the other potteries looking at\\npots and other people are unloading their kilns and we’re completely set up. We have a potters\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n27\\ndinner every year at this house. About ninety people come. We have it catered. Bob Briscoe has\\na big campfire and dinner one night. We will have a dinner just with our own group and their\\nsignificant others one night. Then Sunday night Will Swanson organizes a pizza party at a local\\nbar but most of us are too tired, or it’s Mother’s Day and I have kids so I don’t usually do that.\\nSo, yeah, those traditions.\\nAW: What is it like when you have the dinner with guest artists, is that a good time to connect\\nwith people? Sounds like people come regularly--?\\nCMC: Yeah, it’s hugely meaningful. For the most part these people are academics. Shoko\\nteaches at Alfred—does she teach at Alfred? She teaches somewhere. They teach, they have\\nfamilies, so I think this is just a paid holiday. They’re making money but it’s just really fun for\\nthem. It’s fun to be exposed to so many potters. I think they like being here a lot.\\n01:45:35\\nAW: What are some of your fondest memories of the Tour?\\nCMC: When it’s over. [Laughs]. I like seeing young kids come in and consider that this is\\nsomething that they actually could do in the world. I also think in a world that is so techy\\noriented I like seeing the pleasure that people in the community just get out of the fact that there\\nare so many people doing things that are handmade. I like when people come to this studio that\\npeople are exposed to so many different attitudes, which you’re not in Minnesota. I don’t have a\\nspecific, you know, “This person came jumping over the fire and ate a marshmallow,” I don’t\\nhave an idea about something specifically that happened.\\nAW: Is that a story that somebody shares—somebody jumping over the fire?\\nCMC: No, no. I don’t know. My tenth grade algebra teacher came one year and said, “Do you\\nremember me?” And I’m like, “Oh my god, yes,” you know, that kind of thing, but that happens\\nin Minnesota no matter what you do, you can be at the grocery store. I do it because Bob Briscoe\\nmakes me do it. I do it because it’s really a very positive community act that I feel that we’ve\\ninvented. I think that we haven’t designed ourselves—[question about recorder]—I don’t think\\nwe’ve designed ourselves or fashioned ourselves after anyone else. We’ve really just sat down\\nand hammered out, “Well, this would be a good idea, well this wouldn’t, well this feels good,\\nwell this doesn’t.” I like that process.\\nAW: That kind of group decision-making?\\nCMC: Hmm-mm.\\nAW: Have there been significant challenges along the way?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n28\\nCMC: I think one of the challenges for me was when the Tour was questioning whether we\\nshould be philanthropic. I felt that people were getting to be too small in their thinking and I\\ndidn’t like that. I think that also one of the challenges has been to keep the Tour from not getting\\ntoo big. So, not wanting to be elitist—it’s the opposite of what the group wants to be—but when\\na lot of people want to be part of it how do you keep it small and not appear to be elitist? I think\\nthat it’s really hard when young struggling artists come to you and they want a venue. For me,\\nit’s not something that I can do once. I always keep thinking I’ll have one person that’s rotating\\nand, actually, I thought Ani would be it and the minute Ani came I was like, I can’t rotate her\\nout. I’m not good at doing that. But, Lois Moran who used to be the editor of American Craft\\nMagazine—she’s a friend. I used to be on the American Craft Council. I was on that board for\\nsix years. Lois came once and stayed here and saw the Tour and her criticism was, “You don’t\\nhave enough young rookies in the field.” It’s a valid criticism and I don’t know how to address it.\\nWe’ve talked about having emerging artists but haven’t figured out how to do that yet. A salon\\nde refusés.\\n01:50:18\\nAW: When did you start inviting guest artists?\\nCMC: I don’t know the answer to that because that was not the case in the beginning. I don’t\\nknow. Bob would be a person who would know that. Bob is our historian.\\nAW: Sounds like that was a first step to bringing new people in? Now there’s another discussion\\nhappening about bringing in more new artists?\\nCMC: Well, not really. Lois brought that up a half a dozen years ago and I brought that to the\\ngroup and everybody agreed but we haven’t figured out really what to do about it.\\nAW: Other challenges that face the Tour? What are some of the biggest successes of the Tour?\\nWhy has it become a model for others?\\nCMC: Well, it draws an incredible amount of people. It draws people from all over the country\\nand sometimes out of the country. I think one of the biggest successes of the Tour is you really\\ngo to the studios and you look at the work and you really get a sense of why we all became\\npotters to begin with. You’re meeting people that invest their lives in making things by hand.\\nThat’s their commitment. Their commitment isn’t to mass-produce these objects. I can’t even tell\\nyou how many times I have had people ask me if I want to produce something and have Pottery\\nBarn or Crate and Barrel make it, or go to India or go to China and I’m like, “No, that’s not what\\nI do this for.” This is, for me, a real affirmation of the makers and the people that want these\\nobjects in their lives and it’s a notion of life that existed for me when I started doing it.\\nAW: Are there regular visitors who come to your studio?\\nCMC: Yeah.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n29\\nAW: Can you give us some examples of who they are? Are they from the Midwest? Are they\\nfrom all over? Who are some of the people you look forward to seeing each year? Who are\\nregular visitors?\\nCMC: Boy, some of them are museum curators, collectors, that come from different places.\\nSome of them are from here, you know, people who have an obsession with clay, a love affair\\nwith clay. I’m one of them. Look at my house. If I’m in France or India or Turkey—I’m looking\\nfor the potter. I’m looking for the weaver. I’m looking for the painter. I’m not looking for the\\nLouis Vuitton store.\\nAW: Have you done much traveling and done workshops? Or, had a chance to produce ceramics\\nin other countries?\\nCMC: I have no interest. I’ve gone to India and thrown pots with Indian potters but that’s really\\nto show them that little old ladies from America can center clay and they’re like dumbfounded\\nthat somebody like me can sit in a squat and throw a pot on their big piece of stone. They’re\\ntaking pictures with their cell phones, you know, talking Hindi. But, no. There are people who do\\nthat—who go to Japan and go to places and do workshops. I’m not a workshop person. That’s\\nexhausting to me. I just want to go to my studio. That’s another form of teaching.\\n01:55:05\\nAW: Seems like some of your training started in Colorado and then happened here in Minnesota\\nand then just a lot of your own work on it. So, you didn’t travel to do any training?\\nCMC: No. Painting? New York. I think that very early on, once one decides to be an artist, that\\neverything you do is a teacher whether you’re weeding your garden or taking a walk in the\\nwoods or in a museum in Paris. It’s all food. And, it all comes out and then you couple that with\\nyour emotional disposition of whatever you’re going through at that time in your life and it’s an\\nendless supply of things to talk about.\\nAW: You started this interview talking about how food was an inspiration, making things that\\nwould go well with showing food and flowers. Is that still something that inspires you or are\\nthere other inspirations that are shaping your work? Or passions?\\nCMC: I guess I used to be more specific. I think that cheesecake was the beginning note. The\\nother one was that I came from a Jewish family and I made a soup bowl that I thought would be\\nperfect for matzo ball soup. I was in the Renaissance Art Fair—I think the first or second year\\nthat it opened—and the person that bought that bowl was a nun and she bought it for holy water.\\nI remember just laughing, thinking, Oh my god, there I go, you know, so much for, like, what I\\nthink it should be used for. That was my first lesson of—it’s great that you can have this idea but\\nit might not be someone else’s interpretation or idea.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n30\\nI think that going to painting school has taught me to look at surface really differently. Going to\\npainting school as a potter I looked at a two-dimensional surface as three-dimensional because\\nit’s really how I always saw things, as three-dimensional. I was always really aware of negative\\nspace. I was always aware of how something sits in space because that’s what my head sideways\\nwas always looking at. Part of my training was when you’re going on the surface of the pot, how\\ndo you integrate the surface so that it becomes one so you don’t notice the surface separate from\\nthe form? I think going to painting school just made that conversation more sophisticated. I’m\\nmuch more aware of surface and if I’m just putting layers and layers of texture—I look at it as a\\npainting rather than just layers of slip. Now I have been trained to not arbitrarily do anything\\nwithout being responsible for it being there.\\nI think in the beginning, when I was in a University class with Curt, you know, you would leave\\nthrowing marks on a piece. He would say, “Why did you leave the throwing marks?” If your\\nanswer was, “Just ‘cause,” that was not acceptable. If you want me to see the throwing marks,\\nbecause I see them, than you’re intentionally putting them. If they’re not important to your piece,\\nget rid of them. If they are important to your piece, have them do something. Don’t just tell me\\nabout process, like, I will go to sleep within a second. That was the beginning of that\\nconversation about being responsible for surface. Working in a painting studio and putting my\\nbrush in brown paint and then putting it back in brown paint and the teacher saying, “Are you\\ndoing that again because you want it or because the paint is right there and you’re just doing it\\nbecause you’re lazy. So, look at Van Gogh,” and then out the books come and you’re looking at\\nVan Gogh, and you’re looking at Titian, and you’re looking at Cezanne and you’re looking at the\\nway they put every color application. None of it was mindless. It might have been intuitive, but it\\nwasn’t mindless. It is a very unconscious intuitive act but it isn’t without intention.\\nThen there’s firing, there’s gas firing. You can intend pieces to look a certain way. You can\\nintend the glazes to look a certain way, and then whether there’s a full moon or whether the\\nfiring happened the way it happened, it changes. That teaches all potters a lot about control. You\\ncan say, “This is what I want,” but then there’s an element of you getting what has come out.\\nMore often than not it’s actually to our advantage that it will come out a certain way. It was a\\npleasant surprise and then you take that and you start with your next thing. What you don’t know\\nis often what you start with.\\n02:01:45\\nAW: I think that’s so interesting that story you were just telling about—after all that process, you\\nknow, you start with a vision, then you put on the glaze, it goes into a firing and you’re not\\nentirely sure how it will turn out, and then I’m just thinking of that Matzo ball soup bowl that\\nbecame a bowl for holy water.\\nCMC: Yeah, or you’re positive that you know how it will turn out and it doesn’t. All of these\\nthings in your studio are life lessons. That’s why it’s such a luxury to be an artist because your\\nsynchronicity with the rest of your life, it all becomes very fluid. It’s not like you’re doing one\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n31\\nthing in your work, and another thing with your children, and another thing with your husband.\\nIt’s all the same mixing bowl.\\nAW: That’s very true. It is interesting because it feels that way being a student too. Everything\\nrevolves around learning. We’ve covered a lot of the questions. There are just a few follow-up\\nquestions here. Before the Tour, how did the public interact with your work?\\nCMC: Before the Tour—I don’t know if the public has ever—\\nAW: Well, how did you show your work?\\nCMC: I used to show my work in galleries around the country.\\nAW: Locally as well?\\nCMC: Yes, there was one gallery locally that I showed with.\\nAW: Which gallery was this?\\nCMC: It was called By Design. It doesn’t exist anymore.\\nAW: Since the Tour, how has that changed in showing your work?\\nCMC: The Tour didn’t really change that. I decided that galleries were too political and too\\ntaxing and also, by that time, I was twenty-some years into my career and I had enough\\ncommissions that I didn’t need to operate like that anymore. I do a lot of commission work—\\nmore commission work than straight out sales. People learn of my work and interact from my\\nwork because they see something somewhere else and say, “Oh, where did you get that? Who\\nmade that?” Or, they see my work somewhere and then that becomes a client. That’s really how\\nmy work is out in the world. I have a show once a year in October—it used to be in December—\\nactually I have two shows. One here and one in town and then this show, and those are the three\\nshows I have.\\n02:05:12\\nAW: Did the Tour help you meet people who would commission work or did you already have\\nthose clients?\\nCMC: The Tour for me is more about bringing in artists and generally enriching a community\\nconversation.\\nAW: Since the Tour began, how has a community—you’ve said a couple of times a community\\nconversation—who makes up the potters community now in this area, the St. Croix River\\nValley?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n32\\nCMC: The people on this tour. There are a lot of ceramists in the Wisconsin/Minnesota area who\\nare not on this tour who are really good. Northern Clay Center might be more representative of\\nwho the potters are but they aren’t of the St. Croix River Valley necessarily. Minnesota and\\nWisconsin are really, really rich in different kinds of ceramists. That clay community exists. The\\nWeisman museum would be a flagship, a mouthpiece, because they have a ceramics thing.\\nNorthern Clay Center. Those two organizations. We have White Bear Arts Center, Edina Arts\\nCenter, Minnetonka Arts Center, all of these things have ceramics. There is a big clay\\ncommunity—we are a pottery tour that happens to be located here and we identify ourselves by a\\nlocation. The difference would be all of the hosts—even if all of the hosts aren’t necessarily\\nacclaimed professional ceramicists—have people of substantial reputation at their potteries.\\nThere isn’t any host station that doesn’t have really good potters there. It’s very unusual in that\\nway.\\nAW: Unusual to have that amount of well-known potters all together? When you say,\\n“community conversation,” can you tell me more? What kind of conversation?\\nCMC: Awareness of pots, of ceramics being at a higher level of aesthetic, a different level of\\naesthetic, which maybe this studio brings to light more than others because the Mingei pottery\\nconversation that Warren has popularized so much in this area is a very valid outlet, but, you\\nknow, we tend to be really focused on that in this area so a lot of collectors or makers get really\\nexcited to see that there are other venues that you might go down. Then as I said, school children\\ncoming in and the parents telling them, “Don’t touch,” and we’re saying, “Actually, we want\\nthem to touch.”\\nAW: What do you think the Tour has meant for the larger Minnesota community?\\nCMC: I have no idea. Ask Guillermo and Bob that question. They’re much more apt to answer it\\nwell.\\nAW: What has the Tour meant for the guest artists?\\nCMC: I think a lot. I think they make connections. I think they sell a lot of work. I think they get\\na lot of clients. I think it’s huge. I’ve never had a guest artist that didn’t want to come back.\\n02:10:05\\nAW: You touched on this a little bit but are there things that make the St. Croix River Valley\\npotter’s community unique?\\nCMC: I think the things that I said—we’re philanthropic, you have to be here, it’s somewhere in\\nthis location, we have guest artists.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n33\\nAW: What about a community itself? Do you see a cohesive potters community here or as you\\nsaid earlier its more about individuals coming together for this tour?\\nCMC: The hosts—we all know each other and I would say genuinely for the most part like each\\nother. I don’t know that I want to have dinner with everybody that is a host.\\nAW: When you first started Warren was part of this and you had taken classes with Warren. Was\\nCurt ever part of the Tour?\\nCMC: Just as my guest.\\nAW: What was it like to host a tour with a former teacher? Or was that not--?\\nCMC: There’s a lot of Warren worship in the area and I’m not one that has it. Warren is just\\nanother guy to me. It was fine. He is more in sync in a way with the way Guillermo is going to\\noperate, or even Bob, you know, than the way I operate. I’m probably the odd man out. I’m\\ntrying to think if there’s any other studio. I don’t know if Richard Vincent has a point of view\\nwith his studio. Linda definitely is a fan of Warren’s but Linda will have different kinds of\\npotters at her studio, as does Bob. Guillermo is very devoted to Warren’s teachings. I mean,\\nWarren, you know, I love that Warren has brought so much to the area and he’s, you know, he’s\\nan old potter. He loves it. He makes beautiful pots and he’s made a huge contribution. He’s put\\nthis area on the map in many ways in pottery.\\nAW: Do you feel like the Tour has done that as well? Has the Tour helped to bring attention to\\nthe area? How might you see that?\\nCMC: Yeah, totally, by the fact that four thousand people come to it.\\nAW: Well, I asked about teachers because when we first came in you showed us right away\\nPeter’s work and then his students work and, though it seems like teaching hasn’t been\\nsomething you’ve pursued, it seems important to you.\\nCMC: So many ceramists were teachers. They just were. It’s how they supported their habit. It’s\\nmuch more common than not. I could show you Warren’s work and Curt’s work and I’m one of\\ntheir students and I can show you there other—this house is filled with all of that, you know, so\\nsure.\\nAW: I find that really interesting that you have that message there. You see these linkages, these\\nnetworks, these connections from one artist to the next.\\nCMC: Yeah, well they kind of all learned from each other in one way or another.\\n02:14:45\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nC. Mayeron-Cowles\\n06/02/14\\n34\\nAW: As kind of a final reflective question, what are your hopes for the Tour in the future?\\nCMC: What are my hopes for the Tour in the future? I guess I was supposed to read these\\nquestions and think about them. I would hope that the Tour can plant a seed for prospective\\npeople that are wanting to do something as crazy as making ceramics as a vocation, as a\\npossibility. Or, that the public is reminded of the integrity that is in handmade objects. We live in\\na fast paced technical world where the bottom line is about dollars. This is not about that. This is\\nlike going to a music fest. This is a different conversation. It is reminding people about a very\\nbasic thing that everybody has which is a creative core and this is expressed through clay. The\\nTour is another vehicle for that message. As long as the Tour can deliver that I think it will be\\nsuccessful.\\nAW: Do you see over time that new hosts will join the Tour? How might that change in the next\\nten, twenty years?\\nCMC: I don’t know, probably. I’m sure I’m not going to do it for another ten or twenty years. So\\nyes, I think logistically you could just have so many people doing it and if I drop out than maybe\\nsomebody five miles away can say, “Can I be in it?”\\nAW: Are there elements of the Tour that you hope will continue in the future?\\nCMC: I think things evolve and change and what is true for me is going to be different for what’s\\nin the future. I don’t have aspirations for how I think it should be.\\nAW: Thank you so much for sharing all these stories and memories and thoughts with us.\\nCMC: Sure.\\nAW: Is there anything else you want to say or anything else we should know about the Tour or\\nanything else about your involvement in the history of the Tour?\\nCMC: I don’t think so, I think it’s been pretty extensive.\\n02:18:49\\nEND OF INTERVIEW\",\"transl\":{},\"fullrs\":{},\"find\":\"96.pdf\",\"dmaccess\":{},\"dmimage\":{},\"dmcreated\":\"2015-02-13\",\"dmmodified\":\"2015-02-13\",\"dmoclcno\":{},\"dmrecord\":\"95\",\"restrictionCode\":\"1\",\"cdmfilesize\":\"330267\",\"cdmfilesizeformatted\":\"0.31 MB\",\"cdmprintpdf\":\"0\",\"cdmhasocr\":\"0\",\"cdmisnewspaper\":\"0\",\"page\":[],\"id\":\"p16022coll44/95\"}]", "geonam_ssi"=>"http://sws.geonames.org/5046990/"}, {"id"=>"p16022coll44:99", "setspec_ssi"=>"p16022coll44", "collection_name_ssi"=>"American Craft Council", "collection_name_tei"=>"American Craft Council", "title_tei"=>"Interview with Richard Vincent, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_ssi"=>"Interview with Richard Vincent, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_sort"=>"Interview with Richard Vincent, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_unstem_search"=>"Interview with Richard Vincent, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "contributor_teim"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_unstem_search"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_ssim"=>["Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer)", "McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)"], "creator_teim"=>"Vincent, Richard, 1955-", "creator_unstem_search"=>"Vincent, Richard, 1955-", "creator_ssim"=>["Vincent, Richard, 1955-"], "creator_sort"=>"Vincent, Richard, 1955-", "description_tei"=>"Richard Vincent (1955-) grew up in White Bear Lake and studied pottery in high school and at Lakewood Community College in Minnesota.

Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb, Project Assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed. Why don’t we get started?\\nFirst if you could tell us about when and where you were born? Where you grew up?\\nRV: Sure. I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, grew up in White Bear Lake, suburban kid of a white, blue-collar family. I was the last of a family of four with older parents who were not highly engaged with me, so I had a lot of freedom. I spent a lot of time in kind of wild places and gathered a real love and interest in nature that evolved into being involved with creative expressions, artistic expressions, towards nature motifs, so-to-speak.\\nAW: So where were you exploring around in your childhood? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n2\\nRV: Well, it was just our neighborhood. Oddly enough, we had swamp fields, or fields across the street with woods and the lake. I was very much involved with swimming and bike-riding. I’d bike ride for hours, just go around the various lakes: White Bear Lake and Bald Eagle, and that just essentially was it. Until I grew up older, I really got a drive for travel. I wanted to explore the world that way and I did some of that.\\nAW: When did you decide to start traveling?\\nRV: In high school, I decided I really wanted to get out and see the world.\\nAW: Where did you go?\\nRV: Well, I first went to the western states, hiking and backpacking—the Tetons, came back from that trip and wanted to do more. Took a car trip with one young friend of mine, a woman friend of mine in high school, and went to the western states, down the coast and stuff. But after that I realized that my desire wasn’t fulfilled, I wanted to do more backpacking, and it was more of a car camping trip. So I pursued more money and then traveled for like nine months. Backpacking in the western states, in national parks, Grand Canyon, and went to Mexico for close to five months. Then it was after that I decided to go back to school.\\nMaybe we want to go to my first interest in pottery then?\\nAW: Sure, if you want to go ahead, yeah.\\nRV: (Laughs) Seems like we’re going off on a trail—\\nAW: This is good background material, so unless you want to jump right into that, there’s a few more questions I have. When were you born?\\nRV: It was 1955.\\nAW: 1955, okay, and you mentioned that you had three older siblings?\\nRV: Yes.\\nAW: Did they also enjoy outdoors and nature?\\nRV: Well, two of them were almost a generation or half a generation ahead of me, so I didn’t spend that much time with them. The younger one that was just closest to me, we did spend a lot of time together. She ended up doing things that I wanted to do. Probably was an impetus for me to kind of grab a hold of traveling too.\\nAW: When you took off for your travels in the western states what were some of your first impressions? Had you been out of Minnesota before then?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n3\\nRV: I had, with the family some, a little bit.\\nAW: Yeah.\\nRV: Well I was thrilled to be able to backpack in the mountains and hang out on the seashore and such.\\nAW: Yeah, and for someone exploring around the Minnesota wilderness and landscape, to be able to go out to the western states to see the mountains for the first time—it’s just really incredible. Do you remember any stories from that time, any first impressions of seeing some of that natural environment?\\nRV: Nothing that I want to share (laughs).\\nAW: Okay—\\nRV: I don’t know, I mean I don’t know how detailed you want to get?\\nAW: Well, I was just curious cause it seems like you’re really inspired by nature and by plant designs and things like that, so—\\nRV: Yeah, I wouldn’t say I necessarily grabbed a hold of my artistic designs from my travels, so much, necessarily. I think that evolved more as I spent a lot of time with gardening, once I got more settled. I got into the gardening thing. I remember a certain period in my life I just really needed a breather. Focused on my work to express myself—and really, I actually asked God, Give me some type of growth in my work. I was kind of in this—I don’t know what you call it, just a cycle of repeating what I’d been doing, so-to-speak. And then I grabbed hold of the botanical theme really big time and I was really inspired by Janel Jacobson’s work. Do you know her work at all?\\n00:06:06\\nShe’s actually Will Swanson’s wife and at the time she was carving porcelain. And I was really impressed with her work, she’s an incredible artist. So I decided to start carving, and that really helped me express more of a botanical theme in my work, more in-depth-wise—\\nAW: Your first interest in art?\\nRV: Yeah, well, I like to say I got my start in pottery when I was about six or something, hanging out with my friends in the backyard. It was a really, really muddy summer and I happened to find this place where we could make bowls out of the mud. And, of course, that’s just a little anecdote but I really got the bug or hooked on pottery in high school, in my sophomore year.\\nAW: And you went to which high school?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n4\\nRV: That was in White Bear Lake. D. Krech was the teacher at the time. We had modular scheduling and it was the big thing then, and so we had a lot of liberality in our time. And I would live in the pottery studio. He’d allow us, even while there were other classes going on, and I just spent a lot of time there. Through my time there and three years of high school I decided at that time that I would like to have a studio eventually. And that was one thing that I could express myself and I was doing well with it. So, I thought, Well, maybe that’s a direction I should go to. And then after those couple years that I mentioned traveling, then I returned to school at Lakewood Community College, it’s now Century. Spent some time with the attendant ceramic teacher there, Mackleberg, during the summer, but then the following year, they brought in—she was a student of Warren MacKenzie, Susan Eggerman. They also brought in a studio assistant. So the studio was open ten hours a day and I just ate it up. I decided I’m going to really focus on my potting and after that years’ time or so I wanted to start my business and that’s what I did.\\nAW: When you were in high school and you realized you had a real interest in pottery, did you have any role models or people who made this a life career?\\nRV: Right, no, the teacher, he had a business, or he was starting a business—\\nAW: And his name again was?\\nRV: That was D. Krech. I think it was David Krech. I think he was kind of D. Krech—\\nAW: Oh, okay. How do you spell his last name?\\nRV: I think it was K-r-e-c-h. I don’t know if he’s still around, I don’t think he’s the teacher anymore, but—\\nAW: Did you interact with him much?\\nRV: Not particularly, his teacher would do some demonstrations and [unclear] would do some work and, it was kind of surface—\\nAW: And then at community college you said that your professor there was Professor Mackleberg?\\nRV: Yeah—well, he was the one that I did some summer classes with, but then after that it was Susan Eggerman. She was a student of Warren MacKenzie’s and she worked with porcelain, and that’s where I got introduced with porcelain. I know she recognized in me, she says, “Well, Richard, you got a bent.” Yeah, I mean I was a student who just wanted to stay there all day long. One day talked to me, “Richard, you know we’ve got other classes and students coming in. So, you’re going to have to give up a wheel.” And I was heartbroken, and I didn’t do it (laughs). I just stayed in class and she never kicked me out.\\n00:10:38\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n5\\nAW: What do you think drew you to do that all day?\\nRV: Well, at that time I had a passion to get involved with pots as an income. I really wanted to focus and after spending that time, like I said, for a few years after high school traveling, starting a family already, and got married, and I just thought I have to get some steady income going here. And so I really wanted to focus, really focus, and see how far I could go with the opportunity I was given there. I mean with the studio open in the evenings too, it was just a great opportunity to just continue to make pots.\\nAW: And how would you describe your work then?\\nRV: I certainly had influence of the classical designs of China and such. I know I made one set of jars called Yin & Yang [brief pronunciation debate with “yang”]. It’s interesting how that happened, and it’s about all I can say about it. You know, it was just exploratory student work.\\nAW: And you said you were interested in finding a way for that to be your main income. So, were you doing shows then? When was your first show?\\nRV: Well, my first show was at the end of my last year, that intensive year. I had a student show at my in-laws house and showed my work from college, and people showed up and I was really encouraged. And so after that, then I started doing the shows around town.\\nAW: So that must have felt great to have—after this intensive year—to have a good show like that and see the support for your work. Do you remember anything from putting that show together? You said your in-law’s house, is that it?\\nRV: It was at my in-laws’ house, yes. I don’t know what to say—it was just great to have people come to look at my work, purchase it, felt really good.\\nAW: How did you get the word out to people?\\nRV: I can’t even remember at this point. It was word of mouth, probably did a mailing—a postcard mailing, I’m really not sure. It was too long ago (laughs).\\nAW: So this would’ve been in the early/mid-seventies?\\nRV: Yeah, it would’ve been the late seventies. In seventy-nine. I started my business—so it would have been ’seventy-eight probably when I did that show.\\nAW: So did you earn a degree from Lakewood?\\nRV: No, I didn’t, and I know I was pretty much doing—just really going there to spend time in the ceramics studio. I did some other classes, an outside interest in music—I studied piano. But I wasn’t really degree focused, and like I said I had a young family that needed me, and I had one child. But when I was in school I was just more intent on trying to get my business going, make money. The professor, she recommended that I go on to college and I just thought of the time A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n6\\nand money involved, and I didn’t do it. I must admit I miss not studying business aspects or getting more tied into the higher level education and relationships in the university setting.\\nAW: What did you think of working with Susan? How did her style or philosophy connect to Warren’s?\\n00:14:58\\nRV: Right, her work wasn’t really the Minnesota—mini—? [Mingei-sota style]. It’s mixing the Hamada work with the Minnesota influence. She was more of a classical porcelain worker. I don’t know how much that intermixed with Warren’s work. She did bring us to a workshop, brought him in for a workshop—we went to his studio—so, I must admit I don’t have as much as connection to Warren MacKenzie as many of the other potters in this group.\\nAW: Was that the first time you met Warren? What did you think about his or the Hamada approach to pottery? Did that work well with what you were doing? Or were you really doing something different?\\nRV: I don’t know, I think I was just kind of clueless (laughs). I was just a student working with clay, you know. I remember one other workshop, it was Taeko Tanaka. She came in and was doing the work, and just a funny anecdote—I asked her how much she made a year with her work And she said, “Six thousand bucks, and that was gross.” And I know a number of us students said, “Wow, I’d like to make six thousand bucks.” (Laughs).\\nAW: At that time was that a good yearly salary?\\nRV: Yeah, to think you could work at something you love like that and make money too.\\nAW: So after this first show you decided you would make a business of it? How did you do that? How did you start putting it all together?\\nRV: Right, I purchased a potter’s wheel. Had it dropped off at the house and it was in my kitchen (laughs), and I found a—\\nAW: And where were you living at this time?\\nRV: It was a lake cabin on the north shore of White Bear Lake, just a small home. And then I looked—I must’ve found my kiln on a notice at Minnesota Clay Company perhaps, probably on the board there. I don’t know how I got wind of that, but it was a Minnesota flat-top that—Nils Lou was kind of leaving town and him and his buddy had this kiln. And here was this huge kiln that I was able to purchase for fifteen hundred bucks. My landlord noticed that I had this potter’s wheel in the kitchen. He says, “What’s going on there?” And I told him and he says “Well, I’ve got this garage right out here, you know, right now I’m just using it for storage so if you want to make your studio in there go ahead.” So, for a little bit of money I was able to rent the building next to the house and it wasn’t far away, and started my first studio and started doing shows, and growing in my work. It was quite the struggle in the beginning. I didn’t make much. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n7\\nAW: Tell me a little bit more about the struggles? About making enough to get out there, building an audience for your work—?\\nRV: Well, certainly, I mean just making work that people really want to purchase, and then learning how to price it, right venues for your work, just growing as a potter, where people appreciate your work. I mean that’s, I think, the tough part, especially coming from where I was coming from. Yeah, pretty much just an independent study person, and I didn’t do the apprenticeship, or higher level training, so it was a lot of trial-and-error. But there was one year I actually worked up a pretty good income. And then I became a housefather. At the beginning I said I had one child, well (laughs), I mistakenly end up bringing forth four children. I mean it wasn’t my plan, you know, I was thinking we’d stop at two. But didn’t make the attempts to make sure that happened so we had four children. And it was just to the point of we can’t afford to take care [pay daycare]—so, I became a housefather, with kind of mixing in sometime when I could work with my pots. I did that for quite a few years before Michelle finally got in school.\\nAW: And your wife, what’s her name?\\nRV: It’s Barbara. She ended up studying food technology and ended up at Pillsbury. So that was a really good financial help for a budding potter.\\nAW: And where did she—which location of Pillsbury did she work at? Did she work at their headquarters?\\nRV: What do you call it? The St. Anthony Main, of course now they’re General Mills.\\nAW: And were you guys living in White Bear Lake this whole time?\\nRV: Yeah, until—well I can’t remember what year, it’s been about twenty-five, twenty-six years, when we moved here. As it turned out, my landlord, which lived right next door, came over one day and said, “Well, I’m going to give you six months’ notice, but I’m going to be tearing down this house and building my dream home here.” He had an older home next door and him and his wife wanted to build right there next to the lake. So we started looking for property within six months, maybe it was three, anything we could afford. We had to get out of town so that was how we found this place. When we saw it, it looked quite a bit different when we came here, but for the price, and close to a school district because we had these four kids still. We knew it was for us and we settled.\\nAW: Here in North Branch—So, you’ve been here since what year?\\nRV: Well, I don’t keep those details well but at least twenty-six years.\\nAW: Okay, so that must’ve been quite a commute for Barbara—\\nRV: Yeah, and it still is, she still is—\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n8\\nAW: Oh, she’s still working, okay—\\nRV: Yup—\\nAW: Wow\\nRV: She still is, yep, she’s struggled with that through the years.\\nAW: Why did you decide to move here?\\nRV: It was economically feasible and the house was an incredible price for the property here and it did have a building that I could make into a studio.\\nAW: And you had space for your kiln?\\nRV: Right.\\nAW: What was it like in those early years when you were setting up your business? And even after you left high school and stuff, how did your parents think, what did they think you were up to?\\nRV: (Laughs) Well, my mother would say—her idea was that I should go to technical school, you know, learn a trade. And my father, I don’t know, he wasn’t one of these strong fathers that’ll tell you what to do. It’s pretty much you make it on your own and you find your way [in life] and do what you like. They came to my first show, maybe another one in the city park, but I didn’t have a lot of strong support [from them] for me to pursue that. I did the Renaissance Fest for years, had an award winning building down there and such. They never even came down to see that one; they were sort of disengaged parents as far as my arts. They were older people—yeah, I don’t know, not highly educated, the arts certainly were not where they were at, per se.\\n00:23:47\\nAW: What did your parents do?\\nRV: Well, yeah, they were just blue-collar people that really didn’t—they grew up in a different era. My father, in his later years, he was working as a foreman at Union Depot in the mail area, and I think all the years I was alive my mother was a housemother.\\nAW: Were they from White Bear Lake originally?\\nRV: My mother migrated from Germany between the two wars. And oddly enough, her family came out here to North Branch. And my father, he was a St. Paul-ite, I imagine, all his life.\\nAW: So, his parents were in St. Paul as well?\\nRV: I believe so, all their lives too. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n9\\nAW: Your mother migrated from Germany—how long was she here in North Branch? How did she meet your father? How did they meet up?\\nRV: My mother’s family eventually moved to St. Paul and that’s where she met him. I’m not sure how they met up, a friend of a friend or something.\\nAW: Okay, now your siblings at this time, what were they up to? What were they doing?\\nRV: At which point?\\nAW: When you were first starting this business. I’m just trying to get a sense of your early experiences and family.\\nRV: Family sure—my oldest sibling, my brother, he was a carpenter. At the point that I was starting my business we were kind of disengaged; we really didn’t have a lot of interconnection there. And another sister was a housewife, and would spend a lot of time with her kids. So as I was growing up I was spending time with her kids, my niece and nephews and she was a housemother. Another sibling was a secretary. The youngest one, she was—I grew up in the seventies and that highly affected my societal thinking. “I’m a child of the seventies,” I say. And they talk about the sixties, but for me it was the seventies and the American revolution—I got really caught up in that. And that was partly too, I mean I was a free will, artsy person. I don’t know how to explain all that at this point, but—. So, I imagined my younger sister, she was kind of thrilled that I was pursuing the arts. You know, she was in college at the time and pursuing arts though she never worked in that field.\\nAW: And what are their names?\\nRV: Well, the youngest is Lynn Vincent and then Tooty, which is Yvonne, she’s passed away, and then the other one, my brother is Joseph, and my other sister is Deanne.\\nAW: Okay, so you’re saying “child of the seventies.” So what did that mean to you?\\nRV: Well, anti-war, counter-culture—definitely a counter-culture person. I suppose I was like a hippie wannabe (laughs).\\nAW: And what year did you graduate [high school] then?\\nRV: That was ’73.\\nAW: What did it mean to you to be counter-culture? Was it the music you were listening to? The lifestyle?\\nRV: Well, even in high school when it came down to it, I did not graduate. I had my focus, I was interested in the arts and that’s what I wanted to do. Thinking back about it, it would’ve been great if there had been like a program that they have now where they have these arts schools. If I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n10\\ncould’ve gotten in a program in high school where, “Okay Richard, this is what your interest is, we’ll help you pursue that.” Essentially I decided, Well, I’m going to do this [pottery] and I don’t have any interest—I mean the diploma, that was like a counter-culture choice. I don’t need a diploma to be a potter. Why? It was like you were going to say no to the status quo, so-to-speak, that’s counter-culture. Certainly going off traveling for months on end, I mean, my mother thought it was being a bum. I just considered it discovering the world and enjoying nature and the beauty of nature. I had read an article in the paper of some guy, I don’t know if he was out of high school, but he traveled with his guitar. And I thought, Wow, I’d like to do that (laughs), and it’s essentially what I did—travel with my guitar.\\nAW: So you play music as well?\\nRV: Yeah, I do play some music.\\nAW: Guitar, and you said piano?\\nRV: Well, I studied piano, but I did not really fulfill that one (laughs). And I’m kind of a half-assed guitarist. But I really enjoy singing and playing. So, it’s an important part of my life.\\nAW: What do you play or sing?\\n00:30:15\\nRV: At this point I suppose it’s hard to describe. I suppose it’s kind of a folk/country type, though I like a jazz influence, and voice. For years I did get hooked up into Christian faith and it eventually evolved into worship leading. So I was doing that for years, but since last year I’m not any longer a worship leader, so—and I must admit I rarely play Christian music anymore (laughs), it’s kind of odd. That’s a whole other story which I don’t want to get into.\\nAW: Oh, okay. Can I ask how faith was important to you in terms of your art?\\nRV: Not so my art, I wouldn’t say—I—you can thank God for your gift. Certainly I’ve had experiences. If you want to get some experiences with my faith and my art, sure I’ll share that. Okay, so, like I said I ask the Lord at a certain period of life, my career, to give me new designs, that’s what it was. And I believe that’s when I started the carving and getting more in depth with the botanical theme on my work. One specific day I was thinking, How can I make a bowl in the shape of a leaf? And immediately I see this vase form. You know how you have a mind’s eye and imagination flows? Immediately I see this vase form and then seeing it cut in half, and then laid on edge, on its side. And then I see—I’m seeing it—how it can get formed into the leaf. So, in some respects that’s really how my faith is integrated. I’ve been baptized in the Holy Spirit, I think my spirit has grown and so receive input from a higher source, you could say. When I asked the Lord how to make a bowl, and I just see that, it was like an immediate answer. So for that question, I suppose that is a good integration.\\nAW: So is the source of inspiration—was it also something that kind of sustained you through the years? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n11\\nRV: Well, certainly, you know, you pray about the weather (laughs)—\\nAW: Particularly with the Tour. It seems like you never quite know—people talking about snow, people talking about rain during the Tour (laughs)—\\nTM: God has a sense of humor.\\nAW: Right (laughter).\\nRV: I suppose at times wisdom, or just needing strength and power to continue, and drawing from the relationship that way.\\nAW: Can I ask if you grew up in a religious household? Did you attend church at all?\\nRV: No, I did not. Interestingly enough, my parents—they really didn’t have a faith at that point. But what had happened was when my parents were married my father’s family was very Catholic so they had to agree with his parents’ wishes for the children to be put into Catholic school. So, my older siblings grew up in the Catholic schools. One of my sisters, who was still living at the house when I was younger, she would attend the Catholic Church, so I attended with her, so I had some experience in the church or with friends, but I didn’t grab a hold of that and—Do you want to hear about my faith?\\n00:34:40\\nAW: Yeah, if you feel comfortable sharing. It feels like this is an important part of your life.\\nRV: That’s fine if you want to peer into my life history. It’s not so much arts related—but anyways—I was coming out of a music venue, I was about sixteen years old and I met this young man—you know how you greet somebody leaving? And he told me, oddly enough, he met God. And I thought, Well, yeah, I’d like to meet God, but I didn’t have time to talk, so that was it, but it instilled the desire for me to meet God.\\nHere, I’m hanging out with my girlfriend—which is my wife at this time—one night. It was a winter night, in my eleventh year of high school, and I sense His presence above me and then hear this voice. I mean I believe that our spirits can hear from God, and so I believe God was speaking to my spiritual ear. He says, “I’m God, I love you, and I have a plan for your life.” I’m thinking, Whoa, what’s going on here? and just happened that we had a meeting planned with some of our friends.\\nIt was a cold winter’s night and we didn’t have a car, but we walked into town and they weren’t there yet, the place was locked up. Two blocks down was my girlfriend’s church, which was the same church I’d attended in the past, the Catholic church. So we decided the go in there, to keep warm until they showed up. Walked in the doors and I hear the voice again, it says, “You’ll be like a Billy Graham.” And I thought, No way, because I was very shy at the time and I must’ve known that Billy Graham talked to a lot of people, though I did not know what he talked about. I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n12\\ndidn’t understand the concepts of the Gospel. So, I just thought to myself, No way, but in my mind’s eye I saw all these people’s faces. It was a very different thing happening. And then one of my friends was there, he was practicing—Saint Mary’s of the Lake had this huge pipe organ—and he was practicing the pipe organ, playing some fugues or something. And we decided to walk up to the altar. And there they had the statue of Jesus Christ on the cross. And immediately when I looked upon the statue of Christ on the cross—you know the Bible talks about revelation—the Holy Spirit gave me this, it was like a download of revelation, of faith, just like that (finger snaps). Jesus had paid the price for my sin. I believed it, I received this gift of faith, it was like I was flooded with light. And you know how I had mentioned that I had wanted to meet God? I knew at that moment that I had met God. It was like I was seeing all my life before. Coming to terms with Christ on the cross for myself, as like, living in this darkness, and that moment was like light, and understanding came into my life. And I know now that at that moment I was born again, like what the Bible talks about, being born again. I didn’t understand those concepts really, though I was living in it, and I was repentant, I was sorry for my sin, I remember weeping.\\nAnd then about two hours later when we were hanging out with our friends, in that meeting place, I had this experience with my girlfriend. She was hanging out across the room—this weird butterfly thing [happened in my belly]—and then I heard the voice again says, “Talk to her parents about marrying her.” (Laughs) I’m in eleventh grade and I’m thinking, Hmm. But it really was a confirmation, because we already had a love relationship and we talked about living together and having a family. Anyways, so you asked about faith, and that’s my testimony on start of my life with God. And I really never did become a Billy Graham in the stadium setting—\\nTM: Did you ever witness him speak?\\nRV: I did. That’s right when he came to the cities years ago. Brought the kids, the family, some friends—went there and that was good. Though I must admit, you know, through my years of faith I got involved with a mission in India. And one of the high points of that mission, like the fifth time I went, we were part of a start-up mission of—indigenous missionaries were asking for help from people in the states. So the beginning of it was just going through the communities praying with these people. Just seeing what God might show or say—interceding. I don’t know if you know the concepts of intercession, where you cry to God for the people of the community that He would come and bring His life and truth to them. And most of these communities were Hindu, and of course being Christian you don’t think of the Hindu faith as the faith to hang out with, so-to-speak. And so from there, after the fifth trip—I mean it started just in prayer and intercession, and now this ministry had grown to sixty church planners, I don’t know how many churches. It’s phenomenal in how much it has grown—But one of the high points you mentioned, Billy Graham is—one of the women in one of these communities who was part of one of these house churches, she invited all her friends to come and visit with the Americans, who were coming to visit. And of course, we were there at that time to meet with people and all to share the Gospel, if given the opportunity. And that night I was able to share the Gospel with the people in that house and many raised their hand and received Jesus Christ as their savior. But, the woman who invited us, she had actually been born again at a Billy Graham concert in New Delhi many years before that, when she’d received Jesus Christ as her savior. I imagine, I think she had grown up Hindu. It was just a high point on that one. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n13\\n00:41:08\\nAW: And kind of a small world connection as Billy Graham moved through, that you were going places and meeting people who had also had similar appreciation for Billy Graham.\\nAW: So it sounds like you had this amazing experience—I was curious that you just seemed to know that pottery was what you were going to do.\\nRV: Right, like I said, I got hooked in high school and I was good at it. I mean I made a casserole and (laughs) and that type of thing, and I just thought, Well, this is something I’d like to pursue. The teacher, he was opening up a studio, like a production studio/gallery type of thing in Mahtomedi at the time. He invited me to come and be a worker for him, if I had interest. But I didn’t take him up on it, I just resisted that one. I was too independent I guess (laughs).\\nAW: Do you feel like you were able to kind of rely on faith while you were starting this business on your own?\\nRV: Well, all I can imagine is—yeah, there’s always an asking, a direction, the inspiration, like I said. The Holy Spirit is a creative spirit, he can lead you, direct you, give you blessings.\\nAW: So, since that time then you became really actively involved in church?\\nRV: I was, very much so.\\nAW: What church did you go to? When you were traveling did you stop by many churches?\\nRV: Oh, you mean in my travel years?\\nAW: Yeah.\\nRV: Not so much. I wasn’t really that strongly connected to the church at that point. I had personal faith, but I really didn’t connect it strongly to, you know, church per se until after I was well advanced in my years and we had a family. I’d experienced what’s called a “charismatic renewal” of the ‘seventies. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of that? That’d be interesting for your history. I don’t know if it came out of the Catholic Church. And that was also when I got baptized in the Holy Spirit. And so that was a strong, you know, connection time of just experiencing God on a very personal level, really powerfully. But then I just kind of—when I was traveling I just kind of got away from that, I really wasn’t a church attender much.\\nFrom here I went to what’s called River of Life Church in Cambridge, this charismatic church. And was kind of longing for that joy I’d experienced in my early years with God. And right away that day, I just sensed the Holy Spirit there, and the flow of life, of God, and so I got very well connected. And then there’s another one you might want to check into if you’re interested in historical aspects of Christian faith. There was an outpouring in ’94, the Toronto Airport Church they called it, something like that. Airport Christian Fellowship is what it’s called now. They A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n14\\ncalled it the Toronto Blessing. I was highly affected by the flow of God during that time of my life too, and I think that was life changing and really got me much more structured into church life. I became part of the worship team and such and started expressing myself musically in a Christian way, at that point, and then being involved with missions.\\n00:45:05\\nAW: So could you describe what the outpouring is? I’m not as familiar with it.\\nRV: Okay, well I’ll talk about the latest one, in ‘94. They called it the Toronto Blessing, in the beginning. The church itself calls it, The Father’s Blessing, essentially is, God for some reason, chooses times in periods of society to pour out His spirit. It’s like God starts making Himself be seen and experienced in very strong, revelatory ways. I don’t know how to explain it. If you go to a meeting where the spirit is being poured out, you can just sense this flow of life, and it’s spiritual life. And if you have any kind of relationship with God, I mean, you understand, it’s Him. There’s deliverance from soul issues, there can be healing deliverances, and there can be some odd manifestations. If you have ever heard of the laughter thing, people get carried away in laughter. I know my wife experienced that once at one of these meetings while in Toronto folks came to the cities, and we’re doing meetings, and it became this healing thing for her. And laughter, it just builds up. It’s coming from the spirit, you can’t control it, and your body is just healed—the soul. And really it’s God impacting the world. And you can continue to connect with Him. You can do it in your own personal time, so-to-speak. He inspires you to work in the world—I don’t know, that’s all I can say about it at this point that I can think of.\\nAW: How long were the Toronto folks here? And where were they from? What church? What organization?\\nRV: Toronto Airport Church. It’s a historical thing. I think somebody came and was doing some meetings. And it’s like, for some reason, God used him, I think it was Randy—I can’t remember his name. And that wasn’t the only place where this outpouring happened, but it’s like it came—the expressions of God’s spirit there was so strong that people came from all over the world to experience it. And I can’t remember how many years—I did spend some time at that church, in like a ministry class years later, but the outpouring weren’t so strong then. I mean, God shows up and, I don’t know how to explain it. I’ve seen it happen, but I don’t know how to explain it. I don’t know how many years that church was so strongly active.\\nAW: But for several years it went on?\\nRV: Yeah, definitely. I’m not sure how long. And there was other ones, just one, in Argentina. Of course the charismatic renewal—and in the early sixties, or the late sixties/seventies—\\nAW: That’s when the charismatic renewal emerged?\\nRV: I think it was the late sixties, I don’t even know the history on that one so much, but—\\nAW: So in the mid-nineties—you said ’94—so is that charismatic renewal was still happening? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n15\\nRV: Well, that was like a new expression of it. I think, yeah, that was like a new outpouring. And I went to this ministry school and they said about every twenty years it’s like God pours out his spirit in a mighty way. And so there was the charismatic renewal of the sixties, I’m not even sure when that started. I got in the tail end of it in the early seventies. And then about twenty years later there was this Toronto thing and that went all around the world. Yeah, it’s interesting. I mean when the Holy Spirit shows up so strong some people can deal with it. Other people go, it must be some demonic thing, you know, the enemy (laughs), Satan’s doing a thing here with these people, let’s get outta here. I mean that’s how intense what’s going is happening. Of course there are some churches who don’t even believe in spiritual healing these days, you know. Essentially to me it’s the fulfillment of, like, in “Acts.” Have you ever read “Acts” and how the different miracles would happen and stuff—outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the rapture of the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues and stuff—healings, my wife, she has a strong prophetic gifting. So then, she’ll hear things either from God for a congregation or for small groups/individuals. We still do some jail ministry. And God will speak directly to some of these guys through her and it’s quite interesting.\\n00:51:05\\nAW: So was that a time when you started becoming more involved in the church and you played music?\\nRV: Right, it was about twelve years at a local church up in Rush City; I was a worship leader, co-worship leader with my wife. And after she left, got brought out into heading up the prophetic ministry. Then I was the worship leader.\\nAW: What church is that?\\nRV: That was Living Water Fellowship.\\nAW: what did it mean to be a worship leader?\\nRV: Well, worship leader is essentially leading the congregation, leading the worship team, preparing the songs, leading the congregation with the worship team into praise and honor of the Lord through songs. And ultimately the idea is that you welcome God in and people start getting back to Him. To honor Him, glorify Him through songs, speak about our life with Him, His life towards us and such. And so, well, at the last church we were at we would, you know, have half an hour to forty-five minutes of praise and worship. It’s a charismatic church, so we gave opportunity for the prophetic gifts to come out. My wife would often get prophetic word to share with the congregation, or some of the others who were so gifted. And, always want more of healing and there wasn’t a lot of healing, per se, manifest, as compared to the prophetic word that was trying to inspire people to draw closer to God or be free from their issues and such.\\nAW: And who was part of the congregation? A whole variety of people? People from mainly this area? Do you get people coming from Wisconsin and Minnesota?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n16\\nRV: Yeah, it was a smaller church in Rush City so it wasn’t huge. You know, it was kind of like a lot of surprise, some people would be coming from St. Paul to participate, or you know, quite a distance. But it’s just because they didn’t know anything else, they appreciated what was going on there at the time. But it’s more like a small, regional church. People would travel a good half an hour to go there at times. At this point I might add that we are no longer part of that church actually.\\nAW: Well, thank you for sharing about that because it seems such an important part of your life.\\nRV: Well, you’re welcome.\\nAW: This is about the history of the Tour, but really it’s about individuals and their life histories.\\nRV: So, you’re really wanting to pursue life history too?\\nAW: I think that it is an important part to understanding you, not just you and pottery. But we should return to—\\nRV: Sure—to the Tour?\\nAW: To the Tour. So you’re getting your business started, and this is in the early eighties. You moved to North Branch—what was that like when you moved into this area? In terms of pottery? Actually, before that, go over the kind of work that you do.\\nRV: Yeah, botanical themes—\\nAW: Anything else to say about the kind of work that you were doing then?\\nRV: No it was the early years, it was very much exploratory, just functional work. And then, like I said, I kind of transitioned. I was doing the Renaissance [Ren] Fest for twelve years. And then I think it was the last year I started transitioning into this carved work, which is very labor intensive. I couldn’t keep up doing carved work and the show. And it certainly, it’s not a great venue for that, you know. So, I just quit the Ren Fest, then after that year end—\\n00:55:50\\nAW: So, that was the kind of stuff you were making?\\nRV: Yeah, carved pieces and essentially it’s throwing the piece on the wheel and then when it’s leather hard you start incising and carving the forms. And I started doing that, so it was just too hard to produce work for Ren Fest. It’s not the venue, you know. Imagine people running around the Ren Fest with something so fragile. It’s not really what they’re looking for. And so, I started doing more shows like the American Crafts Council show. That was very rewarding.\\nAW: When did you start with them?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n17\\nRV: I’d have to look at my resume. I don’t know if it was the second or third year they came to the cities? They were in Minneapolis at that point, I know that. I think they started in St. Paul, and then they moved to Minneapolis. And that’s when I got involved with them, must have been early nineties. And I did a few other places with the American Crafts Council, but never really been much for traveling with my work long distance. I’ve done some, but it’s never really panned out economically well. But I did those through the years, American Crafts Council and other quality shows like Uptown, and transition to Powderhorn, and—I’ve actually stopped doing the summer shows.\\nAW: Why is that?\\nRV: Just a struggle to deal with the heat, the personal work discipline too, I think, is some of the issue. But I had been doing Uptown and then I got juried out one year. Transitioned to Powderhorn Park and that was actually a real nice venue, it was very pleasant. Did well there, but I don’t know, something happened, I don’t know if I was dealing with depression or what. It was just hard for me to build up my work. I’d be canceling for that show and so I just stopped doing summer shows. I hate the heat. Just remember it being in Uptown you know, and one year it was like ninety-five degrees, ninety-five percent humidity, I was like, I can’t handle this.\\nAW: And the crowds of people, you’re just there on the street.\\nRV: Yeah, and I was in a position where—last year—it created a problem for me. We had to set up your stuff on the sidewalk and then at ten o’clock you moved it in the street, or nine o’clock, you know, cause they had the buses going early. I was on Lake Street. And that one year my daughter, she couldn’t—she got an infection, and she was my helper and I didn’t get the set-up. I think that put me on the outs with them.\\nAW: So those were in Minneapolis. Did you do St. Paul art shows?\\nRV: Mears Park. Did the American Crafts Council show then, when they moved to St. Paul for years. And of course, when the Tour started coming around—I mean I did both of them for years, the American Crafts Council and the Tour, but they’re a month apart, and it just got to be too much, trying to be ready for both of them. And a number of the other hosts had dropped out of the American Crafts Council show, just because they knew they could sell their work at the Tour and not pay so much, put so much time into a show, just a month before. So, I finally dropped out, but you know, it was a good show while I was there, but it’s been a lot more pleasant not to have to deal with a show in April when you got the Tour coming up in May.\\nAW: Let’s get to the Tour. So when you first came to North Branch did you know any of the potters here? Did you know what the pottery community was like here?\\nRV: I had met Linda somehow. I did not know the local potters. And I think I met Will and Janel at the Ren Fest. She was there and then she got married and so I met Will there. But they dropped out, almost a year before, or soon after I did.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n18\\nI was not terribly involved with the, you know, the ceramics community of the Twin Cities, besides meeting the people at the shows. Other than that I was pretty much a potter on my own.\\n01:00:38\\nAW: You said you met Will and Janel at Ren Fest and then met Linda at some point. So, when you got here and they started, were there some discussions around the Tour. How did the Tour start?\\nRV: Right—Bob called me one day. I don’t even think I knew him. And he just said, “Richard, we got this tour of studios and we want to know if you’d like to participate.” And I said, “Sure.” And they didn’t invite me to a planning meeting, I didn’t even know if they had a planning meeting. So I didn’t know that much about it but I did the show. And I knew so little about it I didn’t even know if it was a continuing yearly thing. I actually signed up for a different show at Macalester College for that spring, which happened to be the same weekend as that tour. And I know I ended up telling Bob, “Well, I signed up for this show, you know.” (laughs). The communications weren’t that good towards me in the beginning. You know, I really wasn’t in the early start up group. I think they realized, well, we got to get you involved with planning and all that, so you know more of what’s happening. So, in the third year I started attending planning meetings and such.\\nAW: What did you think? Why did you get involved?\\nRV: They invited me to and it was certainly an opportunity to do a show with fellow potters and the Tour, I mean the idea of doing a show. I think I’d done shows here in the past, they weren’t terribly successful. Certainly with a group that was bringing more people in, had more of a customer base. It was just an opportunity that showed up and I thought I should take advantage of it. And it’s been good, certainly. The people that show up for this show, it’s amazing.\\nAW: Yeah, tell us about some of the people who show up? Over the years, are there regular customers? People who show up year after year?\\nRV: Yeah, many do.\\nAW: What was your customer base like when you started the Tour?\\nRV: Well, I had been doing the Minnesota Crafts Council shows so I had a mailing list. I had people that would come to my shows, you know, buy from me, certainly reoccurring customers. Customers here, I don’t know how to explain it. Just some of the people you see in the shows in the cities would show up and—\\nAW: Were they potters themselves?\\nRV: I think they, well, some were potters or students. I think a lot of them were more just collectors, people who really appreciate pots. I mean, I’m amazed at the collector mentality that, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n19\\nthey just have a soul passion to get more pots or to tea pots. And, my family didn’t have that. I still invite my family and they don’t show up, I mean it’s amazing, you know.\\nAW: Are you talking about your siblings here?\\nRV: Yep, siblings, nieces, nephews, they rarely show up. They have in the past, but they just don’t have that mentality of—some people love pots.\\nAW: What about your kids? Did any of them take up pottery?\\nRV: The kids—I invited them in the studio, we made some pots, but they really don’t have that passion. Right now my son will often help with sales or set-up stuff. A daughter and grand-daughters now are starting to help with kitchen work or sales help. So, it’s very much a family operation. And then some people we know from church, they come in and help with the wife with baking.\\nAW: What about your wife, Barbara, did she ever take up pottery?\\nRV: Not really, no. I think, when I decided to go to school, she said, “Well I’d like to do that too.” But she decided to go into more technical studies, she was more science-oriented, and so that’s what she did. And that’s how she got into food technology.\\n01:05:05\\nAW: And when you were starting your business, was it mainly you? Or did she also play a role?\\nRV: Well, she would help with sales and set-up. We’d struggle with different viewpoints and after a while I just realized that I think it’s just better if I (laughs) do my work on my own. I’ll design my own display and you know, we get into too many issues like that, though it was helpful to have her there when I needed her. She was very involved with the Renaissance Festival. We did do a lot of that, we did as a family, you know the kids would dress up. And she enjoyed the time at Ren Fest, she used to—do you know the FOPS at the Ren Fest?\\nIt’s a crazy story, well they used to come down because we had this nice Renaissance style building that was actually award winning. And they’d come on down and play with us. The FOPS, they’re like a pseudo-gay group. Some of them maybe are gay, obviously gay or—they’re just like a weird group of royal court comedians, you know.\\nAnd so they get in to come down to visit her and they’d be across the way and be flashing their mirrors and light into our place. And, “Yoo-hoo” (laughs), and there’d be this extravaganza of playing with them and like a theater setting. She made costumes for the kids and the kids would be out there doing their little thing, having fun with us. And right now she—financial help being a potter, it’s been phenomenal, you know. And it’s been a struggle for her, because I don’t make a huge income. My own personal discipline is not extremely strong, you know. I could say I was raised—we were both raised at opposite ends of the spectrum. She was the first born of a farmer. So she essentially was the farmer’s buddy, you know, to get things going there, and raising kids A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n20\\nand all that too, with her mom—and the cows, and all that. And I was the last born, essentially a suburban brat (laughs).\\nAW: So you’re saying that you guys came from very different—\\nRV: Backgrounds.\\nAW: —backgrounds. So when you were approaching the business—?\\nRV: Like I said, one year after I started my business I was going really strong—had good sales, had quite a number of shows. And then I got kind of waylaid with all these kids, when I decided to be a housefather, and that kind of put a wrench in my business. I can relate to those women who go, “Oh I had a career and then I became a mother at the house, and now I have to get back into my own life.” Even though I continued with pots I was mainly doing the Ren Fest, and build up work through the year and do the Ren Fest. I’ve been doing some gallery shows, I mean, wholesaling besides that, but—\\nAW: What did that mean to you—to be a housefather?\\nRV: Well, I enjoyed it, I really enjoyed it. Of course, I could spend time with the kids in nature (laughs), continuing that lifestyle. I thought I was good at nurturing. So to me it was the most reasonable avenue to take. I’d be the housefather and the wife was very “Type A” strong, more intellectually motivated person—she could take on the moneymaking (laughs).\\nWe transitioned through those early years, that childhood, all those children.\\nAW: So from when to when did you really kind of have to put your work on hold and focus on being a parent? When did you come back to work? When your youngest child was in school?\\nRV: Well then I had my days totally free, yeah. I could definitely start focusing on my work stronger.\\n01:10:05\\nAW: So you were talking about the Tour and joining up. What were your first impressions when you started doing it?\\nRV: Well my first impressions of the group. I thought, Wow, these people are strong, business-minded. They have great connections. Meeting and listening to who they know and this and that, the avenues they walked in, and it’s just a great group.\\nI know my professor, she said, “In the ceramics world it’s who you know that really makes or breaks it in your life.” And they were good people to know. Certainly, being part of this group is a great financial boost in the springtime. It’s something—we work just about all year long in a group, in some manner, like I’m the treasurer for the last eight years, and so the in-depth seeing that part of it, so-to-speak, how the money comes in and goes out and such. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n21\\nAW: Can you tell us a little more about that? How have the finances behind the Tour worked?\\nRV: Sure, well it started out as whatever expenses totaled and each person would report their income, and then the percentage of income in relation to total gross [sales was compared to expenses]. And that’s what you would pay. Will Swanson was doing this, he was the treasurer at that point—and so I sold, let’s say I sold two-point-five percent of the total gross than I would pay two-point-five percent of the expenses. That’s the way it was. So people who made huge bucks would have to pay the greater portion of the expenses. And it was going that way for quite some time. And some of the people who weren’t making huge money—and they were also volunteering, doing their time—I’m doing all this work here, but then I’ve got to pay this. And I actually spoke up, and I was the one who proposed let’s just everybody pay the same rate. I wasn’t treasurer at that point. So we decided then to switch to three hundred dollars down and then [after the show charge] whatever amount was needed from each potter [to meet expenses and our charity goal]. Of course by then we had many guests already sharing the expenses. So then we pay the rest equally. I think that’s a much better idea than doing all this finagling with numbers.\\nAW: Wow, so only three hundred bucks down?\\nRV: Well, like I say, it’s three hundred bucks down in the fall or summertime. This past year was two hundred and seventy-five [dollars] to pay the remainder [after the show]. And then of course, the people who travel, they have to do the traveling expenses. And then we put up tents here, for just about everybody, so then you have to pay your two hundred [dollars] for the tent and then we share the food expenses and that was close to two hundred bucks this year [also] per potter. But that’s all individual [between the studios], how they figure that out, what each potter is paying to share the expenses of the studio—admission and food and such.\\nAW: You’re talking about the guest potters with their host?\\nRV: Yeah, they work that one out, but it’s not an extreme amount. But, you know five hundred and seventy-five [dollars] for the base pay—for how good the show is really. The rest of us, you know, we’re doing work too, along the way—\\nAW: What kinds of work do you do during the year to prep for the Tour?\\nRV: We’ll have a business meeting—it’s actually tomorrow—and we may have another business meeting. Sometimes it’s only twice a year, but then there’s communications along the way. I, myself, am the treasurer. Will Swanson has been putting together, with the help of his wife and a commercial artist, the flyer. I imagine you’ve seen the flyer? Yeah, and that’s quite a job. And there’s a promotional committee, I think Will, [Bob], and Guillermo work on that together, discussing where else we may put promotional funds. And then we also have a charity. Have you heard about the charity?\\n01:15:35\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n22\\nAW: Yeah, tell me more.\\nRV: That’s all part of this, well five hundred and seventy-five [dollars] each total for the show, where we collect six thousand dollars from all the potters. We have a charity fund and then we either choose to distribute it during the year or it builds up. At this point this year we’ve given five hundred dollars to CERF, Craft Emergency Relief Fund. And we’ve committed for—is it five years?—three thousand dollars a year to the Warren MacKenzie Scholarship. I think it’s aiding Northern Clay Center administers, furthering education for ceramics students.\\nAW: Is there a partnership between the Tour and the Northern Clay Center?\\nRV: Well as far as them, they show our flyers. You know, we really haven’t had a lot going with them besides—I suppose having people hear about the show. I know Bob—he uses some volunteers from Northern Clay Center for his work crew. I don’t do that. So he [Bob] has a lot more relationship with—I don’t even show at Northern Clay Center these days.\\nAW: When did they start having the guest potters?\\nRV: I don’t even know which year it was. Will put together this history. [Shows printed document of all potters at Tour.] Jeff, he had [guests] very early on.\\nAW: So there started to be some guests in the nineties?\\nRV: Yep, there were a few guests. I had my first guest in ‘98, Scott Malcolm.\\nAW: Why did you choose to invite him?\\nRV: Well, I was showing at the American Crafts Council show and I really appreciated his work. He had detailed, carved porcelains. Loved his work, you know, he was a pleasant guy, so I decided to invite him. When the concept of guests was becoming more of a thing to do—\\nAW: How did you feel about inviting guest potters?\\nRV: I thought it was interesting. At the time I was showing in my little studio out there, and continued to show in there with him, and that was difficult. He had a small display. But to have my display up in there, and then his small display, and people coming in, him talking, me talking, it just didn’t work well. So I didn’t do that again after that. And then I can’t remember when at what point—oh, right, that next year I was alone.\\nEventually I decided to put up a tent. I heard people were renting these tents, a twenty-by-twenty tent; I decided to put the money into that. So I moved out and it was probably the year when Sandy Byers joined her husband. She did not show outdoors and so I decided to give them my studio and then I’d be out in the tent space. That worked a lot better, just the flow of people who could get around my work. And I can’t remember what year I quit the American Crafts Council show, but it was financially a great move.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n23\\n01:20:25\\nAW: To quit that show and then focus on the Tour?\\nRV: Well, I meant to move out of my studio. To give people more space, because it would always be this log jam trying to come into that little studio, and people would be waiting. And you want people to be able to take the time to relax with your work and look at it. And so some of that was really guest motivated. I had these guests and I had to get out (laughs).\\nAW: Right, so when you first started, how many people were coming to your studio?\\nRV: When we first started? Oh, I can’t even remember. There must be at least a thousand now or more. I don’t know.\\nAW: A thousand now or more?\\nRV: Yeah—it’s hard for me to judge. Some of the people are out there with clickers and stuff and I don’t do that. But it’s been great. I was impressed this year, with the cold Friday weather there were throngs of people, so many people made it. And the collectors have really learned that you want to get the first pick at a show go the first day that it’s open. People show up, they take their vacation day, or whatever, from work. They come prepared to buy (laughs). We’ve had people come from Missouri, I think they purchased a boat up here, and the woman was saying, “Well we’re filling it up with pots.” Yeah, well I don’t know how much they actually had. Another couple, this was the year before—maybe it was that year, both these stories were from the year before this past one—they purchased a mobile RV up in Ontario. It broke down, coming down through North Dakota, and still, they had to get to the Tour. So they intended to come to the Tour with their mobile. They were actually going back to Georgia, I think it was, something crazy like that. And they actually rented a car to get to the Tour, while their mobile van was being worked on. I mean that’s how motivated people are. They didn’t let that stop them. And of course, these days people are flying in from around the nation. It’s incredible.\\nAW: Why do you think they’re so motivated?\\nRV: These people they just have this passion for—the collectors—they just have a passion for pots. They probably have more passion than I do (laughs). Of course, I’m not that big of a collector. I’d love to have more, if we had the space and the money. They just love the quality of living with pots, using pots, and—\\nAW: Are some individuals you can think of? Some examples of a few people who keep coming back?\\nRV: Well these people I see often, spring or fall, it’s called the Bindley’s—have you heard of the Bindley’s collection?\\nAW: Tell us more.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n24\\nRV: This is a couple, I think from Madison. They are avid collectors who actually share their collection with museums. They came this year because they had seen Mary Roettger’s work that she was showing. They had picked up one of her pieces at one of the Madison or Milwaukee shows, a smaller piece, and when they saw that she was showing they had to come. And they got one of her big pieces. Their story goes is that they got so many pots they had to build a new house (laughs). They were talking to me about the boxes of pots under their dining room table and such. It’s like an addiction almost, but it’s an addiction and joy, they so enjoy, obviously, they have the disposable money, they can continue to purchase. They did give me—the wife, she gave me a magazine with a story about their collection. If you want to take that you can have it because I probably don’t need it and you [may] want to read about them.\\nAW: We can just borrow it for now and you can let us know if you want it back.\\n01:25:00\\nRV: It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t have a story about me in it. Though she said—they were giving it to those who are part of their collection. They did buy one of these ones [indicating a piece].\\nSo, those are incredible collectors, the Bindley’s. The other ones, they just show up and, “Oh, I want five of these,” you know, the planters or something. Just people they come back and back. This one woman in—she’s in Wyoming now, I delivered a pot, I think it was last year, that I had asked her if I could keep for photography. And I knew she had had some of my work. She said, “Richard, come and see the collection of your work I’ve got.” She’s got this collection room, so many of my pieces in display cases. I must admit it was a lot of neat work that I’d done through the years.\\nAW: Wow, that’s really incredible.\\nRV: That was really fun to see a collector and their collection of my work. I mean she has way more than I do. I usually don’t keep my work. I don’t have a lot of display space, need the money, so I always pretty much sell it.\\nAW: When you keep an item why have you kept those?\\nRV: Well, this one got busted, so I can’t be selling that. And recently I decided that I like my new cup. This is a new design, I’m starting more—\\nAW: Yeah, it’s a beautiful piece—\\nRV: —just kind of geometric slip textures. So I’ve kept this cup—I’ll get a bowl—\\nAW: Okay—yeah, it’s really just beautiful—the geometric design here on this coffee cup.\\n[RV leaves room to retrieve Briscoe piece]\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n25\\nRV: I had purchased one of Bob Briscoe’s—he calls it a “noodle bowl”—and for years that was my favorite bowl for breakfast. And I thought, Well, I got to start making some bowls. I really hadn’t been doing much in the way of tableware, in these later years, because I really wasn’t happy with the glazes for tableware. And so then I started doing more textural pieces and trying the ash glaze, and I really liked the glaze and the texture, so these are my own personal pieces now. I use them for breakfast and whatever.\\nAW: How did you get this texture?\\nRV: Okay, this texture is the same clay body but in a slip form, just creamy clay. And I add—it’s kind of thick—and I add a small amount of sodium silicate, which gives it a flow-ability. And so [using the cup as an example] when this sets up a little bit—the thrown piece—before I trim the bottom I’ll just take a brush, a flat brush, and brush on—essentially it’s these lines here, but they’re straight lines—and it builds up these lines right here. And I go around, and so it’s got all this lines right here. And then I’ll spin it on the wheel with a smaller brush, and that makes these lines. See? Those are the round lines. And then I finish it off with that same small brush, pulling up. And the slip is moving enough, so it gets these little curls and it’s just a lot of fun.\\nAW: Yeah, that’s really a beautiful piece. And it’s so nice to hold, it’s kind of got that texture as well.\\nRV: Yep, very tactile. I’ve really appreciated the more rustic look, like Bob’s work, but I just didn’t make it. I thought, well, I’m going to try working with the ash glazes. It seemed to get more of the rustic look on a porcelain. I did buy some stoneware and eventually I might actually bring it in the studio because I like how the glazes show up a little bit different, to just have that variety. And so I’d like to develop more tableware. I just haven’t done much tableware for years.\\nAW: What were you mainly doing?\\nRV: Well mostly the vases, planters. I was doing lamps. And maybe do a single display of a bowl or a bigger bowl or some small bowls, but not like cups and bowls, not so much. A little bit of cups, but not so much a [place] setting.\\nAW: So it sounds like you’re still exploring some of these styles—\\nRV: Yeah, a lot of vases—I’ll also show you this one—[RV gets another piece].\\nThis one, I’m actually applying the slip for these leaves by taking a piece of sponge that’s cut in a triangle shape. I just start at the top and then keep going down. I’ll move it with either my finger or my sponge to clean it up. And then after that sets up a bit, then I added the center vein of the leaves.\\nIt’s very labor intensive, these pieces—\\n01:30:50\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n26\\nAW: How long does it take?\\nRV: That one? Might have five hours in that one. I really didn’t keep track of it, but I noticed—I thought I would take it a little bit further this time around, and then add these veins. I really like the veins. Plus adding so much time, I don’t know if it’s—I don’t know. It’s hard for me to produce work that I’m wanting to charge—or needing to charge—lots of money. I had a hundred and forty-five bucks on that and it didn’t sell during the Tour. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t sell at the next show.\\nAW: Yeah, how does that work in terms of pricing stuff for the Tour?\\nRV: It’s a great group to get a decent price. I think there are quite a variety of price points represented in the Tour. I know some people say, “No, they were over.” I don’t know if it was the Swanson’s—they had folks come from out east and they charge a lot for their pieces. I’ve noticed when I’ve been over there too. They must be selling it though, everybody’s doing well.\\nFor me I think it’s just a quantity of work that’s really holding me back. It’s that five thousand dollar limit, though I had a good display this year when it was done.\\nAW: You know, I was just noticing this vase on the table. Is that also part of your new or old work?\\nRV: This one? It’s very similarly made but I didn’t do the pull up in between.\\nAW: I see, wow, very beautiful.\\nWho was the collector you said you went to go see who had a collection of your pieces? Do you remember the name?\\nRV: Terri Chartrand.\\nAW: And did she come again this year?\\nRV: Yeah she did, and she came early (laughs) and she picked one of my favorite pieces. I thought, Yeah, it’s going to a good home. It was a jar, actually in this type of geometric motif. She’s from Wyoming, Minnesota.\\nAW: So nearby?\\nRV: Yep, relatively.\\nAW: Have you gone to other collectors? Have you seen where your pots have ended up?\\nRV: I’ve delivered some pieces through the years but really haven’t seen much, as far as the collection of my work, like I did there. And interesting enough, I became an instructor of a person who was starting to collect my work. She showed up this year and she was starting to ask A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n27\\nabout pottery classes. And I’d been doing community education in the Chisago Lakes school system for years. We had an adult class coming up and she joined in. She realized through the class that pottery was very labor intensive. That’s what she was saying, “This is very labor intensive,” (laughs). She’s got a very good appreciation for the amount of work we put into our pieces.\\nAW: How many pieces do you make on average? And has it changed over the years?\\nRV: Yeah, I don’t really count—I probably had about, maybe a hundred and fifty pieces for this show. I’ve watched Bob Briscoe work, he just pulls that stuff out. Of course I have not seen a lot of his decorative, or the glaze application, how much time that takes. But I’ve noticed some of these people have a very strong work ethic. And certainly I’m weak in that, and personal work discipline. I don’t produce what, I think, many of these other potters produce. Otherwise I’d be doing more shows, galleries and such.\\n01:35:15\\nAW: Well, to have a hundred pieces and they all go, I mean that’s a great sign too, that it’s appreciated.\\nRV: Yeah, the work is definitely desired. I really didn’t count—probably a couple kiln loads.\\nAW: Yeah, when you first started was it around that same amount? Or did you do more early on? How has that changed over the years?\\nRV: Well, when I first started my career I think I just did more bowls, cups and such. And I transitioned to the carved work, a lot of vases, planters. It’s kind of like I’m on an even keel of how much work I do. I think I worked harder before, when I became a housefather (laughs). And then kind of struggled getting into that passion of long hours again.\\nAW: Yeah, I could see how that would be a hard transition. And you probably didn’t really stop being the main parent at home for the kids, even when they were off at school. You were probably the first person they saw coming back after school. It’s a lot of energy, a lot of time.\\nRV: I’m enjoying the slip texturing, I know—I’ve been inspired by some of my guest potters. I don’t know if you know George Lowe’s work? He’s very textural with slips, not quite like this, but—and of course I’ve been doing the botanical slip texturing [but wanted to pursue something different]. His work really inspired me to pursue it, and what I was seeing of the local—my guests—what I was seeing of their textural work, and getting a kick out of it. It’s not so focused as the leaves, the petals, type of thing, which is kind of good too because I do other pieces too that are very time consuming, of the botanical nature. And it takes a lot of focus to do that work. Really a lot of focus and time, and these other textural pieces, they’re more quick and fluid and they just kind of happen. And they still kind of appeal to the eye and hand. So, I like mixing them, I think they work well together.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n28\\nAW: Yeah, yeah, it’s probably nice to have some of that variety when you’re in the studio. So you don’t get into the habit of making the same piece over and over and over again.\\nRV: Right.\\nAW: So talking about guest artists, how have you approached the guest artists over the years? The first person you invited because you just got to know him and you liked his work. Over the years what has been your criteria for guest artists?\\nRV: Well I think the majority of them I did see at the American Crafts Council show, and appreciated their work; just in discussions with them about their work I appreciated their personalities. And I think that what’s been important for me is appreciation of the work and the personality seemed to click. So then I’d invite them and usually they would accept it right away and realized it was a good opportunity for them.\\nInterestingly enough my guest potter, George Lowe, I had asked him early on in the show. I don’t know if he would be my first guest I was asking, but he couldn’t do it. I don’t know if he was aware of the opportunity of the show, but he also had a conflict in a local show down there. And he finally started doing shows, and has been doing phenomenally well here. Though this coming year he’s going off to Jerusalem to start a pottery school in a Christian ministry there, to the Christian Palestinians, through the Lutheran Church system. And so, why’d I mention that? I guess it’s just how I relate with him. So that’s kind of interesting, he’s hoping to be able to come back next year. He invited me to come on over to Jerusalem and visit him (laughs). I’d love to be a workshop teacher in Jerusalem—you know, who knows if anything like that will happen.\\nAnd then more recently Richard Hensley and Donna Polseno—they were at Bob Briscoe’s for years. I really hadn’t met them much, I didn’t know them. But they showed up on a Sunday about three years ago. They told me their story, that Bob was not having them as guests next year, but he said to come on over and take a look and meet with me, to see if they could be guest potters here. And you talked about my faith. So I said, “That’s quite interesting, I’ll think about it, pray about it,” I told them. And when I prayed about it, I heard this response. It was like this “Yes,” and it was like this energy flow, it was just like, “YES,” and it went right through me. So I couldn’t deny that (laughs). So I told them the story of what went on and they came to be my guests. And they’re a really fun couple, so I really enjoy them and they work well here too. A different anecdote about—and then Bob has sent other people too. There’s a possibility of one of his guests who—he’s not inviting for next year—he’s got a whole different story. Did he tell you about the possibility of selling his place and all that?\\nWell, one of his guests is going to be replaced with the person who he’s planning to sell his studio and home to. And so, it’s a possibility that he may be a guest. I know him from the Ren Fest for years and he’s a pleasant guy. He’s actually a co-worker, has been in the past, of one of my guests. It’s a possibility if George doesn’t show maybe he’ll be a guest. Otherwise, I’m not sure. It’s been really hard to say good-bye to guests, and I really haven’t chosen to do that, except the first guy, who wasn’t working to good in the studio. And then another guy who, his second year here, he didn’t do very well. So he really wasn’t interested in coming back. And that’s all I can say, I guess, unless you have more questions about guests? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n29\\n01:42:44\\nAW: Well how many guests did you have this year?\\nRV: We had eight potters here, so I had seven guests. And I’m pretty much at max at that.\\nAW: Are there—so, the Byers, did they continue on for a while?\\nRV: Yeah, they’re still continuing. He was my first guest after Scott Malcolm. And then she came on. And we have a strong relationship where they show here and then I show at their place in the fall. And that’s another tour situation, it’s called the Wisconsin Fall Art Tour. That’s a mixed media show though and it’s much larger than this one. But they actually saw what was going on here with the Tour, in relation with inviting guests. So she’s been working on the committee there and she promoted the concept of guests and they okayed it. So I’ve been a guest—demonstrating potter there—which is quite interesting, showing my slip or carving work and that’s been very good for me to engage the people, to show what kind of work goes into the piece and get them interested in the work. So it’s kind of a symbiotic relationship with them in that respect. I was invited also to show at the Polseno-Hensley “Sixteen Hands” show and the fall show, but I opted out because I don’t want to travel the twenty-one hours to get there.\\nAW: Where are they?\\nRV: They’re in Floyd, Virginia. There’s actually a group of them that show in this show too. Another one of the “Sixteen Hands” people is a guest at Will and Janel’s place. I don’t know if they have Silvie Granatelli, if she’s there too, or at one of the [other] show studios.\\nAW: You said when you met Polseno and Hensley and you had that spiritual moment—how did you connect with them?\\nRV: I really appreciated their personality. She and him, they’re very open, and easy to laugh and joke. I don’t know if they’re Christian or into that at all, I just—that was a private moment, when I prayed. I just shared that with them (laughs).\\nAW: You did share that with them?\\nRV: Yeah, I did share that I prayed and I heard that “YES” just fill me up. It was just so wild (laughs).\\nAW: What was their response?\\nRV: They probably got a kick out of it (laughs). I don’t know. “Cool!”\\nYeah, this show has been incredible for them. They did phenomenal at Bob’s and they’ve done very good here too, though Richard always says it’s his wife’s work. I’ll show you one of her pieces if you want—I’ll get it. [RV shows example of Donna Polseno’s work.] A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n30\\nWhat she does is she makes the original pieces, and then, I think this main piece here is molded—a porcelain mold—and then she does her design work. Yeah, her glazes are so nice, and her little birds and whatever she does.\\nAW: So a similar botanical, natural design here?\\nRV: In some respects right, but her forms are so different with the carving, or the manipulations that she’s doing.\\nAW: It’s beautiful. Who are some of your other guests? And how have you gotten to know them?\\nRV: Bill Gossman, who I met at an American Craft Council show—I really appreciated how he was displaying his work and his forms, his pitchers—his are wood-fired. This is actually a piece of his—this huge—[indicating an example of Bill Gossman’s work]—jar behind you here.\\nAW: Oh wow, that’s gorgeous. Are those dragonflies?\\nRV: They’re fish.\\nThese larger pieces, when I saw them I thought, I’ve got to have that. And this one—it’s kind of a funny story, is that I saw this—it was like a can of spray or something—of cleaning fluid, and I thought, Oh that’s too evident in your display, Bill. And I just decided to come back there and say something about it. But when I went and saw it, I saw this thing, and it was displayed lower and I hadn’t seen it before, and I just thought, Oh my god, I got to have that. (Laughs) So I do have some passion for some pots, but his pots really grab me. He’s very playful, he does a lot of different things. And so I got him to give me a deal on that one (laughs).\\nAW: They’re just beautiful, wow.\\nRV: Yeah. Did you get enough on guests or did you want some more?\\nAW: Well, the guests you had this year—Bill was part of it, and—\\nRV: Yep, and the next one over is Steven Hill.\\nAW: Where is Bill Gossman from?\\nRV: He’s from New London, Minnesota, and he’s actually been there for two years—(laughs) smaller town.\\nAW: And you said Steven—?\\nRV: Hill, yep.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n31\\nAW: And how did you meet him?\\nRV: I met him years ago at a local show that the Minnesota Crafts Council used to do at St. Kate’s. And then at Bob’s, he was there for a number of years, I can’t remember how long. As it turned out I just felt like, what do we have, like two, three guests here? I was thinking, Well, we need some new blood. And I was just asking our [tour] group at our business meeting one spring, who’d be a good person to bring in some new blood. People might be really interested in seeing their work. His name was one name of many. And so I decided to put the word out to him to see if he had interest, and he did. So he’s been coming—do you know his work at all? Here I’ll—[RV gets example of Steven Hill’s work].\\n01:50:00\\nAW: We were just talking that it’s amazing that you have all these pieces from guest artists here. It’s really fun to see.\\nRV: He has transitioned into cone six electric work, and he does a lot of workshops teaching that. And he gets into some odd shapes, he does some slip too. He sprays his glazes. I think it’s all porcelain.\\nAW: He sprays his glazes?\\nRV: Yep, he sprays his glazes. And he’s highly collected. He actually had this pitcher—and he gets a phenomenal price—that cup is fifty bucks and this pitcher was five hundred [dollars]. He gave me this pitcher, I would never have bought it, but I was just admiring them one day and he said, “Well Richard, you can have this.” (Laughs). I never objected, I guess. Well, I did object, I mean five hundred bucks for a great piece like that—so, I’ve either purchased or been given—\\nAW: It’s incredible. Did you purchase many of these? Or were these gifts from the guests?\\nRV: It depends who it is. These large ones of Bill’s I definitely did purchase. He gave my wife—sometimes my wife will get a gift for all the food preparation and stuff, and all the work she puts into it—he gave her that one. And all these bowls, that’s from Win Byers, and these platters I’ve got up here. He usually gives my wife one and then Sandy Byers, she always gives me a piece for letting her show in my studio. So she’s given me a collection of these [shows objects] through the years.\\nRV: And her pieces start now at like a hundred and twenty [dollars] (laughs), for those. And these, well these go up to five hundred [dollars]. This one she had three hundred bucks or something on it. And she had some that have these square angles on this one year. And I know she’ll be giving me one, so I said, “Could you give me that one?” And of course it had like five hundred bucks on it (laughter). I was just throwing it out there and she said, “No, the collectors want that one, but—” She ended up giving me that one; I couldn’t believe it.\\nAW: It’s really amazing to see everything together you can really get a sense of connections between the guest artists and your work. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n32\\nRV: I should show you—[RV gets example of George Lowe’s work]\\nAnd this is a George Lowe, very earthy. He used to do wood-fire, but if you know anything about the wood-fire you know it’s very labor intensive to fire it up with wood, hours and hours. It’s a lot of serendipity, who knows what’s going to happen to your pieces so he started doing a different process where he can get more of the earthy wood-fire look, but it’s still gas.\\nAW: How did he do that?\\nRV: He’s putting on a slip and then over his stoneware clay, and then he’s sponging some of it off. And then he’s spraying on some other stuff, and he sprays his glazes on. I don’t know how to describe it, but if you want to see him describe how he does his work there’s actually a video that I put on YouTube. I think it’s under “Richard Vincent Pottery.” I actually did an interview of him about his work, the potters’ tour, what he thought about it, and then describing his work and he describes the work process of his work, and it’s kind of fun to watch. If you have an interest, get more detail about his work. He speaks about his work really nicely, he’s been a professor so he knows how to give a spiel (laughs).\\nAW: Have you done any instructing over the years?\\nRV: I did do a workshop at Anoka Ramsey and that was really enjoyable. It was kind of like getting paid to have an audience as you do your work (laughs). I did some carving and slip application, and it was a lot of fun, and then I did a slideshow. Besides that I would like to do more workshops, but I’ve been doing a lot of community education teaching for kids, kindergarten through middle school, and then adults or parent/child groups through the Chisago Lakes, been doing a lot of that. We just got done with a series of four different class groups, plus adults. And you’ve heard about these grants? The Community Education got a grant to bring in various motif or themed artists. So I was the potter. And they had painters, drawers, theater—and at the end of all these classes they gather the kids work and we do a big art show at the high school. It was really cool. But I enjoy working with kids and they pay well, so that’s been a good part time job. I really haven’t pursued the workshop thing besides what I’m doing with the Community Education and the one workshop at Anoka Ramsey—that was invitational.\\n01:56:05\\nAW: Who invited you?\\nRV: It was Mark Lambert. He’s actually done a number of the workshops with the host potters. He asked to be my guest one year, but I just didn’t want to go for that for some reason.\\nAW: But he is a potter himself?\\nRV: Yeah, he does pot, though he is a professor so I don’t know how much potting he does.\\nAW: Now why do you like community education so much? Why do you like working with kids? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n33\\nRV: Well, I like sharing my knowledge with kids or adults. I do more of the kid’s classes because they’re more readily scheduled. I was invited to do that, and interesting enough—we talked about the charity program—he started out with one rented potter’s wheel, and I was there doing the potting with a kid at the time, while the coordinator was doing hand building with the rest of the kids in class. And he said, “Richard, it would be great if we could have more wheels. Do you know how we could get some more wheels?” And I thought, Oh yeah, I know, I could ask the potter’s group if they wanted to donate money for wheels to the Community Education. So I went to the business meeting that spring and they said, “Sure.” So they granted six wheels that were transportable. They were beginners’ wheels, so they’re light, but they’re stackable and stuff. So then the program—it’s just grown, it’s just amazing. I think that was one of the great charity gifts because so many kids through the system, and adults, have worked with those wheels. And they ended up donating a kiln also. So the kiln gets use for those same classes.\\nAW: What is it like to be—I’m just thinking back to when we started this interview, talking about being in high school and taking this class and starting to really enjoy it—what is it like now to be, at this point in your life and your career, to be looking at kids who are experiencing their first time with clay? Or maybe their first time centering a pot or something? What is it like to be around them and to see them learn about this craft?\\nRV: (Laughs) Not sure what to say—well, I can see the difficulties, with the young kids it’s quite difficult. You end up giving them a lot of help along the way. But to see them growing, it’s very rewarding. Thrilled to see the creativity of some of the kids, it’s just phenomenal how much they can produce. They really have a passion. This one young girl, she came up to me at the class one day and she says, “I love this class!” (Laughs).\\nI like to see them growing in their work, appreciating their work. The school system, with Community Education, is kind of difficult because we don’t have set classrooms where all this work can sit here until next week necessarily. It’s always put into a storage area or you’re competing with a teacher in her classroom a little bit. And then you have to set it up and tear it down, so it’s a lot more work then I necessarily appreciate, but for the amount of time, I’m getting paid well. But I appreciate working with the students. It’s very rewarding to see the art show, and some of the kids come in and see their work displayed, sharing it with their parents, and their parents getting involved.\\nYeah, I’m just wondering if we’re making progenies? I don’t know if any of these students—. For me, it’s so different. I got a little bit of taste in ninth grade of pottery, but I didn’t grab a hold of it. But some of these kids they keep coming back even in their young years, through middle school—and so they’re really growing and learning somewhat what clay is about. Most of them don’t get to glaze their own work or see the kiln situation, but the adults do, and some of the parent/child groups. It’s very rewarding though to see them enjoying it. And then some of the pieces that they turn out—it’s amazing—some of them have good, innate talent to create, and it’s kind of fun.\\nThe newest thing I started was four-by-four tiles. This one young guy he did a little tile so pretty, it was so pretty, really nice. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n34\\n02:01:30\\nAW: Why the tiles?\\nRV: Well, I think it gets something simple—the coordinator has really been focused on the wheel work—personally I think hand building or wheel, it’s just working with clay and there can be a lot of creative expression in the hand building. The tiles are very simple for younger folks to relate with. A lot of what the kids are making in the younger classes is just a bowl, because they can’t pull up or they can’t get the vase form too easily. The bowls are the easiest. They’re creating simple forms that unless they’re embellishing it much they don’t really look like much, but a simple little bowl, you know? But the tiles, there they can really have some liberality, because you can draw on it, you can stamp on it. And sometimes it just really catches the eye, can really appreciate the design work.\\nAW: Have any of the kids and their parents come to the Tour?\\nRV: There has been some yes.\\nAW: What has it been like for them?\\nRV: I think they got a kick out of it. One young girl, her name was Ella, she was quite young to participate in the parent/child group, and there were only two parent/child groups in that class so I could spend a lot of time with her. And she made a tea—a little tea set and stuff—so she was very creative. And they came, and they really enjoyed their time. Some of the other adults and students showed up. I don’t get much of the child groups coming in with their parents for some reason. I hand out the pottery tour flyer to the kids and adults a lot. I think a lot of those people, if they’re participating; they’re going to more of a local studio. At least I have not been aware of any of them coming. That one collector, Terri Chartrand, she was an adult student with a friend of hers one year. But she comes and—I think it’s one thing to put your kid in a pottery class where they can enjoy working with clay, and quite another thing to get involved with actually bringing them to a show where pots are being shown—if they don’t have the passion themselves. I have not done a specific mailing or personal invitations stating this is what I do, and it would be great if you could come, so-to-speak. I share it with the kids, they bring it home and their parents see it—I don’t know if they even understand what it is. (Laughs) Who knows?\\nAW: The parent and kid classes, those sound really interesting too. Can you tell me a little bit more about those?\\nRV: It’s an opportunity for a parent to just learn pots and potting with their child. We do hand building or the pottery wheel, whatever they want to work on.\\nAW: Do many of the parents that come to this class have previous experience?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n35\\nRV: Sometimes they’ve had some, maybe in high school or college setting, but most students haven’t had much, if any, at all.\\n02:05:05\\nAW: Are they grabbing on to pottery as something they could keep doing or is this something special?\\nRV: Well, there are a number of students, especially the adults that talk about how, “Oh, I’d love to get a wheel,” or “I’m getting a wheel,” you know, and “How much does a wheel cost?” “How much is a kiln?” It’s kind of like, it’s not a cheap hobby and then you have to have the space for those things too. Some seem to be more serious about wanting to at least learn and grow. Whether they will purchase the equipment that it takes, or not, time will tell I guess.\\nAW: You said George is going to do this workshop that’s also kind of a mission—?\\nRV: Well, yeah, I think it was mainly tourism [that brought them] over to the Middle East. He wanted to go to the historical birth of Christ and all that stuff, work with the Palestinians and stuff like that. They went to this ministry his wife’s parents had been involved with through the years. They found out he [George] was a professor and they wanted to add some classes to their school and one of them was pottery [so they asked him to teach]. It sounds like she’ll also be teaching basketry—his wife’s a basket person.\\nSo—what was the actual question?\\nAW: If those kinds of things were common or if you had been on any trips like that—where you go, and travel, and teach pottery in other parts of the world?\\nRV: No, no.\\nAW: Have you ever done anything like that?\\nRV: No I haven’t. That would be great; I’d love to do that. When I went to India I did see a local potter in action but didn’t get involved really and that would be fun. I know George; he’s worked with Potters for Peace in Nicaragua, where they produce the water containers for purifying water. They teach local potters how to make them.\\nAW: So, back to the guest artists, we’ve gone through most of them. Are there any others that you want to mention?\\nRV: Yeah, I think I pretty much described them all.\\nAW: What do you think the Tour has meant for them?\\nRV: It’s been incredible for their sales. Donna Polseno, she says they haven’t had a retirement account and this show has helped them really build their retirement account. Each one of them, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n36\\nit’s a financial boost, it’s really good for them. Mainly it’s that--they enjoy the show, the people, they’re so motivated to come; they appreciate the work. Obviously many of them have a local clientele from doing the American Craft Council show or local shows through the years.\\nAW: And what is your process for the week of the Tour? Does everybody come a couple of days early and set up? How does that work with your guests?\\nRV: This year I asked that they [RV’s guests] be sure to at least start setting up on Thursday. Some people require that they be all set up on Thursday. As it turned out, for us, some of them showed up later, thankfully we had the tents. But we had a deluge on Thursday, by the time a number of them showed up. But we did have a good portion set up. So most of them just come, I’ve had maybe one guest just stay here through the years, but I usually don’t host them at my house, so they are at the local hotels. I said I wanted everyone set up at nine [o’clock] on Friday, you know the Friday of the show. (Laughs) I was the worst offender! I ended up doing some last minute photography of my work. There was new work and I just had to photograph it, and I finished up with that Thursday evening. So Friday came upon us and I wasn’t quite ready at ten [o’clock] (laughs)—\\n02:10:22\\nAW: But you got everything set—?\\nRV: —But that’s the way it goes.\\nAW: You said your daughter helps, and does your son help too?\\nRV: My daughter comes on weekends to help the wife cook or carry out stuff to keep the table filled up. We do cookies, fruit water, and mixed fruit essentially—tea, coffee. So, my wife—we buy wholesale, the frozen cookie dough she would get from General Mills. So she’s cooking either brownies or cookies all weekend long. And helping the folks to eat, she makes lunches. The son helps with some set up or sales. I might take a daughter to help with sales too, or my granddaughter—she’s very mature for her age, she’s fourteen now. So she sometimes does sales with me. And the rest of them, some people require a helper, I don’t require that. I’m pretty comfortable in my approach. Just want them set up and to be around for the show. I don’t know what else I could say.\\nThis year we did a Saturday evening get together for dinner here. Friday evening, Bob has been doing a get together at his place, so those who want to go to that went to that. And that’s about all I can say.\\nAW: Then Thursday evening is Connie’s place?\\nRV: Yep, Connie, she has a group dinner for whoever signs up and wants to pay for that, they can go and do that.\\nAW: So, it sounds like there are a lot of celebrations after each night. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n37\\nRV: Yep, and then Sunday evening Will and Janel—for those that want to congregate at their place come and maybe half the show shows up there. As far as the potters or some helpers, you get in your last good-byes and visits.\\nAW: How has the community developed amongst the hosts and with the guest artists? It seems like these dinners are a great way for people to meet each other.\\nRV: It’s true, and I imagine relationships have been built up through that intermixing.\\nAW: Do you feel like there’s a strong sense of community among the participants of the Tour?\\nRV: Some of them, generally, yeah. I mean some of them have strong relationships even before they got here and that’s why they invited them. I’m friendly with these other potters, we don’t get together typically and talk pots. I know once we did a salon at Connie’s, where we actually had dinner and then brought our pots and talked about them. People gave comments or whatever too.\\nSome people have more friendships that are kind of ongoing. I know Linda and Guillermo, they were friends before. She was the one who kind of introduced him to the group and asked that he could be a host. And some of them maybe meet more regularly.\\nAW: Do you meet up with many of the other [host] potters?\\nRV: Not besides business. You know I’ve done some, like skiing with Will in the past, [and] different shows. It’s called “Art—” I can’t remember the name of it—it’s this gallery in Stillwater, they did a group show with us as host potters. And then this past winter we did what they call a “pop-up gallery” in an empty shop that they were able to move into for the holiday season. Many of us showed at that and that was good. Both shows have been good for us.\\nAW: Now you’ve known Will and Janel for quite a long time right?\\nRV: Right—\\nAW: So, have you guys maintained a good friendship here through the pottery? And how did you get to know Janel?\\n02:15:00\\nRV: Well, I met her at the Ren Fest just walking around the show, seeing her do a little demonstration. So I met her and then Will showed up in the scene, met him there. And we spent some time—I’m not that sociable of a person though. I’ve skied with Will before. We talk when we meet. Usually it’s in relation to business, besides that it’s not like, “Come on over we’ll have dinner,” so-to-speak, and let’s do this and whatever. Once in a while it’ll happen, but it’s not so much of a—we’re supporting each other along the way—maybe some of them are much more A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n38\\nthat way. I don’t know if some of them went to school together, if they’ve had a relationship even before the Tour?\\nAW: What has being part of this [potters] community meant to you?\\nRV: It definitely gives me the opportunity in the springtime to show my work to a very appreciative audience—extremely appreciative. It’s helped me to meet other potters, I suppose, spending time building relationships with these guests along the way. Certainly that symbiotic relationship I have with the Byers that gives me an opportunity for a good show in the fall too, at their place, spending time with them and their family. They’re more of a business relationship, but with the other potters it’s been good. I’ve certainly met some more people, like at Northern Clay Center, or Mark Lambert. I suppose they’ve taken notice of me more by meeting me along the way—on the Tour, that I’m a part of it. I suppose it gives you, as a potter, a certain respect from the general audience out there, if you’re a potter in this show. It is considered a high quality show of potters.\\nAW: Tell us a little more about that, what the Tour has meant to the larger community?\\nRV: I think it’s been an example for other groups to draw from, and I know there have been a good number of offshoots, so-to-speak, where they saw the example of what the Tour was doing, and many tours, I think, have developed by seeing what’s going on here and how successful it’s been for us. I know there’s been lot of people who would like to either be a host—and we haven’t wanted to add more hosts because we’re kind of at a manageable size right now, it seems to work well. But the addition of the guests has expanded it and also added interest.\\nAW: Speaking of the connection to the greater public, and other public audiences, before the Tour how did the public interact with your work? You said you did a few shows?\\nRV: Yeah, I did the American Craft Council show, a number of summer shows in the cities—\\nAW: And then you said you got a website set up at some point?\\nRV: I have a basic website, though I’ve been really lagging behind on my internet presence. I’ve got a site on MNartists.org that I put together years ago, and it’s very much needing updating, which I haven’t gotten to. For some reason I haven’t made that a goal and a priority to get to. I don’t have my new work on there. I did purchase a domain, richardvincentpottery.com, but I haven’t—I was thinking of producing one through one of these “fit in your parts,” like on Weebly. I haven’t found something that works and I’m thinking that I should get more serious about that and get a webmaster to work with me and put the money into it. I’ve certainly, through the years received a good number of purchase orders through my website. People see me online, even from other states surprisingly. But it needs more up-building to get “with it” in the technical era that we’re in here. I think web presence is good. I’m considering the Etsy thing, and I haven’t got that going yet.\\n02:20:30\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n39\\nAW: How do you think new technologies and internet have changed the Tour over time?\\nRV: Certainly the website that is produced has been very helpful to connect with the greater public, nationally. I imagine—have you seen the website? Yeah, and people can tie into the mailing, tell us a little bit more about who you are. Helps people to judge where they want to go, perhaps, I’m not sure. It’s interesting when you listen to people, “Oh I’ve come to the Tour for years, but I’ve never been here,” but they’re thrilled to have found us. For whatever reason they didn’t choose to come here, they may have ties to some of these other potters, who are really big in the collector’s world. And so, it’s thrilling—people really enjoy it when they get here.\\nAW: What have been some of your fondest memories of the Tour?\\nRV: Fondest memories? It wasn’t so much this year, but for many years it’s been where Bill Gossman’s brother comes and plays guitar. He’s a great guitarist. On Sunday after you’ve lived with all this appreciation of your work, people pouring out their money into your household and mixing that with this beautiful guitar music, it can just be this overwhelming joy. That’s—I’ve experienced that through the years. I used to experience that at the Ren Fest too (laughs). It’s just great to have your work appreciated by people, they want it—it really is great.\\nAW: What have been some of the successes of the Tour?\\nRV: Certainly, as a whole, the financial gain for the potters has been excellent for most of them, many of them, national notoriety, where collectors will fly in from around the nation. I’ve heard of other people from different countries, but I haven’t met them so much. It has a lot of respect with the quality of the work.\\nAW: What makes it successful do you think?\\nRV: Certainly the promotion. And the different people who are the hosts, who have strong connections to the potting world. There are a number of them that are the caliber that will get accepted into the top shows, like the Smithsonian Craft Show and such, and have wide-ranging connections to education institutions where they can encourage students to come, participate in viewing the work, see what’s going on here, the galleries and schools that will help promote it. And certainly that’s helping to draw in the students, many of them come and buy too. And many of them are learning along the way from the potters too [also].\\nI suppose that’s some of my fondest memories too, is when you get to interact with students or people involved with different stages of their work. They really want to know what you work is, and you can describe it and how you go about it. For the last couple of years we actually had a high school tour coming and that’s been fun. This year they seem to be much more open to asking questions and receiving the ideas. To me those are some of the fondest memories, when you really get involved with the work and describing it, and people really have a passion, and maybe want to do it themselves.\\n02:25:25\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n40\\nAW: What have been some of the challenges in doing the Tour? Have there been any challenges in doing the Tour?\\nRV: Just in preparation. We have this large, grassy yard, and I feel like I have to clean it up after winter. And so getting people to help with that, and getting that part prepared, getting my own work done, learning how to time it all, making sure I’ve got the help. You know, for the last eight years I’ve been the treasurer and one of the biggest challenges is trying to get this—I’ve chosen to have the final fee finished up prior to the event starting so that’s been kind of like the last week thing. When you’re trying to finish up your work, trying to get that done too—the expense statement, so I can come up with what our balance needs to be. Just getting it all set up.\\nCommunications, I mean it’s a challenge having to communicate with all these artists, make sure they’re getting their slides in—well, now it’s digital—and images. Getting paid, sometimes you get a potter along the way somewhere who can’t pay, you know. But you work that out. And just doing the bookwork with that, it’s an added responsibility though I enjoy giving that part of me to the potting community. For years I was more just helping get the word out, spreading the flyers around. I thought I would take a more active role and I seemed to be needed, there needed to be a new treasurer.\\nAW: How exactly did you get into the role of treasurer?\\nRV: Somebody did it and they said they couldn’t do it anymore. I thought it was time for me to step up and take a more active role in the group and giving to that community, so I said, “I’ll do it.” And thankfully my wife, she has good spreadsheet [skills] she knows how to set that up. So she’ll actually help me write that up for the group too, when it comes time to finalize it all for the expenses of the year. I mean the checkbook is not that hard, but—\\nAW: So how did the Tour do this year? Despite these really cold Fridays--?\\nRV: Well for me I think I had my best Friday. The weather didn’t hold me back at all. I probably had close to my best year monetarily. Some of the years I’ve gone to the end of Saturday and think, Oh I don’t have much for Sunday. This year I had a pretty nice looking display on Sunday and I still did well. For me it was a great year. I still need to learn how to get out four kiln loads instead of two—that would help. I heard that everybody did well, some of them did a bit more, a bit less, but everybody is happy. Some people here had their best year or close to it.\\nAW: Why do you think this year was the best year?\\nRV: As far as some who did the best, I wouldn’t know. If they had more work, time was right for them, other people, their pricing, I really don’t know. We had good attendance here.\\nAW: So what would be the highest that a studio host and a guest could total?\\nRV: Oh, in a studio?\\nAW: Well, I mean, yeah, for one of the— A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n41\\nRV: Or a guest? Or host?\\nAW: Host and guest together. Do you compile that each—?\\nRV: I did not this year, I only heard from some of them.\\nAW: Okay—\\nRV: What they did and\\nAW: What’s the ballpark?\\nRV: Well I’d say if you’re going to talk about potters as a whole, from studio to studio, maybe a few thousand to twenty thousand [dollars], close to twenty thousand, fifteen to twenty thousand. I mean I’ve heard that number in the past. I didn’t hear from anybody what they actually did, as far as the hosts. Some of those hosts, it’s phenomenal though, what they’ve done. So that’s a great financial uptick.\\n02:30:30\\nAW: Now for individual guest artists—what’s an average of what they make? Or does it change a lot from year to year?\\nRV: I think it depends on who. Here at this place we’ve had anywhere from—well, the low end close to sixteen thousand [sic; corrected by RV to one thousand]—that was the guy who didn’t come back the following year. The high end has maybe been about ten [sic; corrected by RV to fifteen] thousand, so that’s what we fluctuate around here.\\nAW: So, an individual would be making that much?\\nRV: Yeah, an individual.\\nAW: Oh, I see.\\nWell that’s great!\\nRV: Yeah, for three days of sales.\\nAW: Yeah, and it seems like weather is always a factor, but it doesn’t seem to influence—or maybe it does encourage people to buy more?\\nRV: I think if it’s crappy weather maybe they move faster? You know, “It’s cold I’ve got to keep moving.” But this year it didn’t hold people from coming and buying. It sounded like a lot of people had really good Fridays, and that was really a lousy weather day.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n42\\nSaturday was decent, the weather was pleasant, sales weren’t quite as strong for me, but still very good. Sunday was kind of like the “off day,” sounded like, for a lot of people.\\nAW: Is that typical from year to year?\\nRV: Usually it is, and the Sunday crowd at shows can often be—you know, many people who aren’t as motivated to get there right away. They don’t necessarily have all the money, they just want something to do on a Sunday afternoon, take a look—so I’m sure, that’s the only day they could get there and they’ll buy. It seems like a different crowd on Sundays at most shows.\\nAW: Who is there on Sundays typically? Do people come for Mother’s Day celebrations?\\nRV: Well sometimes it is, but it’s just less people. And less of the strong, motivated collectors who know they have to get there the first time around. It’s just more casual people.\\nAW: When did you guys start offering cookies and brownies and food and drinks and stuff?\\nRV: I think that all started in the beginning. We don’t offer alcohol here. I think Guillermo offers wine, I don’t know if he does beer. I know it’s Bob who has been big on his kegs of beer through the years. It’s a bit of a concern for some of us because it is a driving tour. And thankfully we haven’t had any major issues when it comes to the actual driving. I think sometimes people get too intoxicated over at Bob’s (laughs), but—when you have free kegs of beer—\\nAW: When you’re out in the woods, in this beautiful landscape—\\nRV: Yeah, some people kind of just live there too, cause maybe they’re volunteers, maybe they’re staying the weekend—nothing to stop them. I don’t know if the people who are actually doing the Tour do a lot of [drinking and] driving, hopefully they’re not getting too intoxicated. I haven’t heard of that one.\\nAW: Yeah, right. Do you think it helps to have the food and stuff? Does that kind of welcome people? Do many tours do that?\\nRV: Oh yeah. I think many do at least something. We get comments about the hospitality; they really appreciate that. I know that one thing that’s different about this tour [site] is that we do our own sales. I think the majority of the hosts have central sales tables. But I’ve never wanted to do that, my guests don’t want to do that. It’s a whole different thing when you have to go to finalize the sales portion. Actually, my wife heard a comment this year about that, which was interesting, I’ve never thought of it that way, that these people were talking about how they really appreciated giving their money to the potter because we, as the potters are selling work directly to them, as opposed, they said, to some of the other places feeling like a Target cashier, where you’re just coming up to anybody cashiering. I was surprised to hear that. I’ll share that this year since at the business meetings some are thinking that’s the way we should be going. They haven’t forced us to do that. But I think it can be a little interruptive for some who want to buy their stuff and get moving. If they’re buying from multiple potters in one spot, then they have to go to each potter to pay. But I was surprised to hear that comment from a visitor, that they really A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n43\\nliked sharing their money directly. And that’s what some of my hosts [guests] have said; they really appreciate that opportunity to meet with the costumer, and the passing of money and the expression of appreciation they get in that moment of the sale.\\n02:36:00\\nAW: Yeah, I could understand that too because you don’t get to do that very often any more, with the way that business is conducted now online all the time.\\nRV: Or at the galleries, or consigning your work, or wholesaling.\\nAW: Well, thank you for all of your time. I just have one or two last reflective questions here. This is kind of a big question, but what has pottery meant in your life?\\nRV: It’s an avenue for my creative expression. I’ve thought in the past that I’m just somebody who has to create. Obviously with my connection to clay at an early age and I just got hooked. So that’s been my avenue for creativity. I’ve also been doing nature photography for a number of years, but I haven’t found that to be particularly monetarily fulfilling. But knowing that any business you have to promote, and promote, you have to market photography. I know nature photographers say that you have to market like eighty percent of your free time, and that’s not my thing (laughs).\\nAW: Why do you like the nature photography?\\nRV: I get involved with the nature, not just to look at it and experience it, but to capture it and share it with others. It’s that capturing and sharing which is fun. It’s capturing the moment, the beauty of the moment.\\nAW: What do you see pottery meaning now and into the future?\\nRV: Well it’s definitely my livelihood. I feel like my wife wants to retire coming up next year, and so I really have to get on the ball and learn to make more income out of it.\\nAW: So you think you’ll actually increase production?\\nRV: Yeah, I can definitely see a lot of opportunity there to increase production. That’s why I’m wondering about the photography. When I was a worship leader I was putting in quite a few hours in a weeks time with that too. Even though I enjoyed it, there was a lot of responsibility there too. Now I don’t have that [worship leading], it’s just getting myself motivated to produce and come out, work and bring in the income.\\nAW: Are there other crafts or art that you’re pursuing? Or other passions you have in life?\\nRV: No, besides the music and photography, no, not that I would say.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Vincent\\n06/09/14\\n44\\nWell, gardening, I used to have quite a passion for gardening. I did the vegetables and the flowers. We’ve got some gardens, they’re mostly perennial, but they still take time. We’re growing another little garden out here just for landscaping purposes. I was a birder so to do the garden, to increase hummingbird activity in the garden, and butterflies, so I still do some gardening. But it’s hard to spend a lot of time in the soil (laughs). That used to be a strong passion of mine—organic gardening.\\n02:40:10\\nAW: You were just describing to us this new design that you’re working on. Do you hope to continue doing more of this tradition?\\nRV: The slip texture? Definitely. And add more tableware; just expand my line of products. And if I could make more in the year, I guess I can improve my sales.\\nAW: That’s great! And then the last question, what are your hopes for the Tour in the future?\\nRV: Just that it keeps going strong. We’re all getting old—older, put it that way (laughs)—it’s hard to know what will happen in the coming years. To me it seems like if it could just continue similarly the way it’s happening, well, that’s just great. It seems to be doing what it was intended to do, give many potters the opportunity to show their work, meet with collectors, sell it, and financially support themselves.\\nAW: Any comments about what the Tour has meant in your life? You said it’s helped you build relationships. Anything else about what the Tour has meant to you?\\nRV: I suppose I’ve grown, just intermixing with the potters, and being the treasurer, just giving me great opportunity to show my work. I’m not sure what else to say about it.\\nAW: Well you have said a lot already so these reflection questions sometimes go back over some things. But sometimes new things come up, so it’s important to ask. Thank you so much Richard, for sharing all this time and your stories with us. Anything else you want to add?\\nRV: Thank you for having an interest and doing this work. Hopefully it’ll inspire somebody else I suppose, who takes a look at it, or to consider it historically if that’s their interest. I don’t know, it’ll be interesting to hear of anything that actually transpires because they heard of this.\\nAW: Yeah, yeah it will.\\nWell, thank you, we will end here.\\n02:42:58\\nEND OF INTERVIEW\\n\",\"transl\":{},\"fullrs\":{},\"find\":\"99.pdf\",\"dmaccess\":{},\"dmimage\":{},\"dmcreated\":\"2015-02-06\",\"dmmodified\":\"2015-02-06\",\"dmoclcno\":{},\"dmrecord\":\"98\",\"restrictionCode\":\"1\",\"cdmfilesize\":\"421803\",\"cdmfilesizeformatted\":\"0.40 MB\",\"cdmprintpdf\":\"0\",\"cdmhasocr\":\"0\",\"cdmisnewspaper\":\"0\",\"page\":[],\"id\":\"p16022coll44/98\"}]", "geonam_ssi"=>"http://sws.geonames.org/5039450/"}, {"id"=>"p16022coll44:102", "setspec_ssi"=>"p16022coll44", "collection_name_ssi"=>"American Craft Council", "collection_name_tei"=>"American Craft Council", "title_tei"=>"Interview with Edie Abnet, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_ssi"=>"Interview with Edie Abnet, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_sort"=>"Interview with Edie Abnet, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_unstem_search"=>"Interview with Edie Abnet, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "contributor_teim"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_unstem_search"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_ssim"=>["Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer)", "McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)"], "creator_teim"=>"Abnet, Edie, 1947-", "creator_unstem_search"=>"Abnet, Edie, 1947-", "creator_ssim"=>["Abnet, Edie, 1947-"], "creator_sort"=>"Abnet, Edie, 1947-", "description_tei"=>"Edie Abnet (1947-) is a painter who was married to the late Richard Abnet (1934-2011) , a potter and founding host of the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour.

This interview is for the A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, made possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grants. Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb who is our project assistant. Thank you, Edie, for agreeing to be interviewed. Why don’t we get started? If you want to start with when and where you were born and when and where Richard was born, your former husband?\\nEA: Richard was born in 1934 in February in Le Crescent, Minnesota. He was the son of farmers and he was also Swiss. It's down in the Le Crescent area where the ice flow never went, so it's extremely rolling and hilly country along the Mississippi River down there by La Crosse and Le Crescent. The Swiss loved it when they moved down there in the late 1800s and set up farming. That is where he's from, Le Crescent, Minnesota.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n2\\nAW: Do you know much about his childhood?\\nEA: He was the second of six children. In 1934, by that time it was the very early stages of the Depression—the worst of the Depression. His father was one of four sons, living and renting a farm from his grandfather's—the father's father—who was kind of a mercenary guy. Farmers were not making money at that time; they were trying to sell hogs and they couldn't make enough money selling their hogs to pay the rent, so the grandfather kicked, essentially, the son and his little children off the farm so they had to move in to La Crosse. Those sort of things greatly influenced Richard, but also the aesthetics of the land was very important to him and the attitude: the work ethic of the farmer. You get up in the morning and before you care for yourself you have to take care of the livestock and you have to take care of the land, and it was a deep respect for that aesthetic that influenced his life as an artist, a craftsmen. Richard would never refer to himself as an artist; he called himself a craftsmen. In the thirty years that we were married there was not a morning that he did not get up—unless the last few years of his life when he was quite ill but working as an active potter—that he wasn’t out in the barn by eight o'clock every day and that was his regime. He was not, by any means, a dilettante. He looked at it as a very serious thing and deeply involved, as a potter, in the process of the land and the pots and the clay; it was all one and the same for him.\\nAW: When he was growing up, what was his schooling like?\\n00:04:03\\nEA: For the first six years of his life he went to a one-room schoolhouse and there were twelve people in that schoolhouse, and he was related by blood to eight of them. So for six years he did that and then when they went into junior high and high school, they had moved and he went to a La Crosse school, he went to Aquinas High School, which was a Catholic high school; so that's where he finished his education.\\nAW: Did he ever reflect on those experiences? The schoolhouse, what was that like?\\nEA: Oh, amazing. He had amazing stories. We have tapes of his storytelling and some of the characters. He had very vivid memories of when they farmed—the farmers in the Valley all farmed together. This was during the end of that great agrarian period when farmers, before things became extremely mechanized—before he was 10 years old, he could hitch up a team of horses and plow and take care of fields. And what's interesting about that, in terms of the believability, is that The Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, I read an interview of her and she had said, “I had to increase the ages of the children by three and four years, at least, because nobody would believe what little children were doing at that time.” And then there's another history I read, Lark Rise to Candleford—which was a series on British television—but in fact is the name of a book, a history book, of the last of the agrarian period before the Industrial Revolution. I sort of liken Richard’s experience as similar to that. Children, in this book before they went into school—there wasn’t schooling—so toddlers by the time they could walk and speak they were taking care of infants; they would be in groups taking care of infants. And pretty much Rich’s childhood—he was the second oldest—and the three oldest would get up—I mean, we’re talking grade school—and have to go out to the barn, the smallest A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n3\\nboy who might have been six or five, would be so tired he often would fall asleep in the hay mow, but the boys would muck out the barn, they would have their cows that they milked, feed the chickens, and any other livestock. So there was a real sense of work and responsibility and he never saw it as a burden, he himself never saw it as a burden. At the same time he said, “We used to pray for rain,” to give themselves time off. But the parents worked extremely hard right alongside them and this all influenced the idea of working with his hands was tied in with that agrarian background, very closely, and the caring for the land.\\nAnd when he bought this place in 1960 that was all part of it. This was an old rundown—well, this was a horrible rundown farm. This was one of those farms that you go by in the country with the broken buildings and the pathetic cattle and the trash everywhere; this was literally what this place was. It's unrecognizable to what he bought. There were no trees; I have pictures of bald hills and a rundown barn in between. This house was built in stages, between the original house and the barn was this massive trench because—this is the third stage of the St. Croix River historically, the St. Croix River is an ancient river and all the lands graduates down, slowly goes down to the river, tilts that way. So the hundred some acres up on the hill all run and they would run by between when it rains or melts, it would always run between this house and the barn. But anyway he saw that there was a hill back here and rolling reminded him of Le Crescent and when he saw it, he knew immediately, he had been looking and looking. When he got out of graduate school—he went to the School of American Craft in Rochester, New York—when he got out of there he moved back here to look—he had saved all the money when he was in the Marine Corps, he had saved everything he ever had—and started looking for places to set up his pottery. And it was like setting up a farm basically for him. But he was married—by this time he was twenty-six—and had a baby so they moved into a pretty rundown place.\\n00:09:39\\nAW: To back up a little bit, when he transitioned from the schoolhouse into the high school, did he ever reflect on his experiences?\\nEA: It was hard. He always had a deep sense of art, and he used to talk about—there is a lot of soil that has a lot of clay in it and he remembers that he would go off and he always wanted to leave something of himself and he talked about making little square cubes of clay and leaving them in the hillsides hoping that this would be preserved and he was leaving something of himself on the landscape. He talked about it because when he went to Aquinas he was a country farmer boy and there were city kids and he was painfully always aware of—because they always worked in the barn before they went into the schoolroom--they probably smelled like cattle manure and that was always, “Oh.” But education and reading were very important in that family. Everybody's got a college education—every one of them has a college education, except the oldest brother. It was natural back than that the oldest brother got the farm.\\nAfter high school, what they did was they all—from the father—they were expected to work for a year before they went into the armed forces. So he enlisted in the Marine Corps and that was right after the Korean War. So after a year of working on the farm—and his brother at that point had bought it—he went overseas. It was a huge experience for him. He did basic training at Camp Lejeune, I think, in California and then shipped out to Korea. One of the things that he A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n4\\nsays about that—well, he says a lot of things that don’t apply anything to his career—but once he became a potter, when he looked back in an appalled manner about was, historically—the Koreans were the first aesthetic artists of pottery. That was where pottery started: was in Korea. There was pottery shards just laying in the fields, and he thinks, “My gosh, how I never could have even noticed it.” After the Korean War—that was a four-year brutal battle, 58,000 Americans killed and the countries of North and South Korean were so devastated—it was so appalling just to see the refugee problem that he talked about that. Then when he went on leave to Japan and again the architecture of the temples all made of wood, but he was unaware at that time of thinking in terms of ceramics. That happened after he came back here and started at St. Mary's University. He started taking classes at St. Mary's University in Winona and then after a year he transferred to the University of Minnesota. Just left the farm and said, “I’m out of there,” much to the chagrin, of course, to his father and brother. But he was never going to work under an older brother. It was just never going to work. They were bright men that needed to go on and there was going to be only one owner of that farm and that was his brother Greg.\\nHe wanted to go into architecture—that’s what he hoped to do. He started in architecture and one of the prerequisites, of course, is that you take art classes. He talked a lot about—what was her name? It’ll come to me—and he had her as an art instructor. He was there a year, I think. He also worked as an orderly, a nurse’s aid, and so he worked at the university hospitals as an orderly and worked his way through—that was when you could have a job and get out of the university without much debt. But then he talks about that he had to sign up for a class with Warren MacKenzie. Warren was ten years older than him exactly—actually his birthday, Warren’s birthday—in fact I saw him a couple months ago and he had just turned ninety in February and Rich’s birthday was in February too; Rich would have been eighty. He said he walked in there and literally his words were, “Blown away,” and he never looked back. He decided that when he started that class that that was it. He was so smitten by it that Warren would give him the keys to the pottery studios. He would go in there after hours. Nobody would be there but he “could not work,” he said—he couldn’t work because everybody was goofing off, and he was a very serious artist. He was single-minded and he went in there and just threw and threw until he could throw the way he wanted to.\\nAfter he graduated he accepted—I don’t remember all the places he applied for. Back then he was a very focused person; he knew what he wanted to do. He knew what his dreams were. It wasn’t like, “Oh, maybe I’ll do this.” No, he knew exactly what he wanted to do. So he had met his first wife at the University Hospital and she was a nurse and they were married and within a year they had a baby. She was pregnant when they went to the East Coast and he was accepted into the School for American Crafts. He studied under a man named Frans Wildenhain who was at the Bauhaus and who had escaped from Germany. There were a couple famous German artists that were there, and the attitude of these people really influenced him. He always thought in terms of functional pottery, you know, ceramics and doing pottery as a functional form for people to use in everyday life and use. I think it was Bob Briscoe—I don’t know if it was unique to Bob Briscoe, but maybe he doesn’t take credit for it—the idea that you could make something that somebody would put their lips on, probably appealed to him too. But he would've always made something, built something with his hands, that's the way he was. He was also, I used say, “A frustrated carpenter,” but he clearly wasn’t frustrated. He did a lot of carpentry on this place. When he left he actually was the first from that university [School for American Crafts] to get a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n5\\nmaster’s degree in ceramics. Nobody had ever gotten that before. They had always gotten their degrees in design and he wanted it in ceramics. Here is that Rochester Institute of Technology [letter] that talks about that.\\n00:18:45\\nAW: This is a letter from 1960: “The Graduate Selection Committee has met and has approved your candidacy for the MFA Degree in Ceramics. This is rather an unusual honor, for customarily this selection committee asks that the candidate work for his Master’s in the field of Design.” Wow, that’s really incredible. Did he reflect on that, what is was like to be the first one to do that? What his students, fellow colleagues said or faculty said?\\nEA: No, no, he was a very modest man. He didn’t reflect on that. You know, when we would have discussions about art—I am a painter. I was married--both Richard and I were married--we were in second marriages. He had four children and I had three, so we brought very complicated past lives to our life together and we were married thirty years. But it was interesting as a woman. I had a grandmother, who was a painter, but she didn’t have a formal degree, but she was very creative and she wrote poetry and I have some of her paintings, which are dispersed throughout the family. But at the same time I always felt inadequate because I didn’t have that degree, but painting was clearly very important and he really supported that. He had this bona fide, you know, important background and it was very important to me to be encouraged by him, but when I would get frustrated and say, “Oh, I’m just doing schluck,” and dismissive about what I was doing, he always said, “It’s not your job to worry about that. Your job is the process, that’s what’s critical here; it’s only the process, if it’s important to you, this is what you do.” And that was how he saw himself. Did he ever pat himself on the back? Never, no, he was not that kind of person. He never, never talked about himself. He would talk about art, he was very self-effacing, but he had a real sharp sense. He didn’t have a lot of time, though, for people that used their creative talents in any kind of social way as far as getting ahead or getting involved in a certain group; he had no respect for that at all, and it just wasn’t who he was. He was here to make pots, make art, and that was it. He didn’t feel he had a responsibility to do anything but that. He was a huge reader of history and greatly respected the whole attitude of the Asian artisan and their single-mindedness in terms of devotion to their craft, and that superseded even the individual or who they were.\\nAW: Did he go to Japan and study with anybody or do workshops?\\n00:23:20\\nEA: No, right after MIT here he was married and at that point, there wasn’t birth control--they were Catholic, you know--it was baby after baby and so he had to get a job. And when he came back to Minnesota, it just seems impossible when you think about it. He got a job, if you can imagine, initially working for a framer. Can you imagine anybody making a living, supporting children working for a framer nowadays? And then he eventually got a job with Economic Labs, and he was probably there for about ten years I’d say, somewhere in his mid-thirties--he said by that time, I think they were done having children, and she started getting part-time jobs and so he decided to devote himself. In that time, he was restoring and renovating and fixing up this place A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n6\\nand building his studio. And whenever he had extra money everything went back into making this place livable and he would do it in a variety of ways: he would he hire a bulldozer to come in at fifty dollars an hour, he said, and just bury everything, all the garbage, and sculpt the land. Then he started planting trees and then he mucked out the barn and started building his studio in the barn and putting on a show room, and once he finished that, he started it—because for over twenty-five years he taught twelve students twice a week, and during that time in the early years he worked as a ceramics instructor for several years--\\nAW: He worked at the University?\\nEA: Not at the University, the other one, you know the big art school connected with the school of Minneapolis Institute of Art? There’s this school there, MCAD. Anyway, he worked there for several years. He was working there, he was teaching there. Basically it was always in his mind to work on his own. He felt that if he affiliated himself with a university, that what happens when you do that is it becomes less about what your work represents and more about the teaching, and it was very important for him to just work on his craft and although he did have to teach—he did teach students and he had some students for over twenty years that would come here and work with him. Nobody ever worked for him. He would have a variety over the years of young people that would come in here and want to be an assistant. But the problem at that point was he worked there by himself and they would always want him to pay them and he would always say, “That’s not the way it works,” and he couldn’t afford to do that.\\nAnd early on he got involved with communities. I don't know when the Minnesota Crafts Council was established, but he was early on involved with them. He was involved in the very beginning of the Uptown Art Show. He was involved with shows up and down the river. When I met him there was a group of us that were getting together, it was the Marine Art Guild [Marine on St. Croix]: it was a range of professionals and nonprofessionals, and we wanted to establish the Marine Art Fair. But as the Marine Art Guild we always felt that we needed some gravitas and so we wanted to get Rich involved. We asked him to be a part of it and he was not interested in the art guild, but he was interested in establishing a Marine art show. So for a while there we did it twice a year and at the time, before we were married, he never had shows here but he had an open studio, and the studio and the showroom were always open, people could always come out here. He used to jokingly say, “If it had been up to the people of Stillwater and Marine, I would've starved to death a long time ago.” People from Minneapolis and in the Cities came out here to buy his stuff. He had a variety of shows. He had shows at the MIA, he had shows at the Walker, he was an established potter, and was getting a lot of recognition.\\n00:29:00\\nAW: And when did you guys get married?\\nEA: We got married in 1981. Of course there was never a question of where we were going to live or how we were going to do this because he had a business, so I moved in and soon I was very influenced by this extremely disciplined guy who got up every morning and said, “This is what you do: you go out and you go up to the studio.” So I did the same. I would get up when the kids would go off to school and we would both go to the studio. In twenty-five years, he came up A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n7\\nor I went down to look at what he was working on or what I was working on. He would always come in and sit down and look, and I would set my paintings up and we would discuss and he would critique and we would discuss that, and then when I would go down; it was the same thing and there were just rituals that went on for years and years and years and then we met here for lunch and again it was always discussing what I was working on, what he was working on, and in that time our work was changing. I mean, he had people who collected his things for years, and he went from pretty dark, earthy, black, dark glazes and they got lighter and lighter and lighter; and little floral designs somehow crept in and what have you. People would go, “Ah, something’s having an influence on you there,” and it was always kind of a grinning thing.\\nAnother wonderful thing that was a part of our ritual was when he was firing—and I never went out there when he opened the kiln—I stayed in the house, made a pot of coffee, and waited. It was what he preferred to do and I knew that. So if it was a beautiful firing he would start walking over to the house with pots in his arms and lay them out all over and say, “Look at this, look at these glazes, look at this.” He and I would just go crazy together over the pots. If time went by and nobody was coming out--I mean, [if] he wasn’t coming--then I knew I had to go over there to see what went wrong, but that wasn't that often. For all the years, even when he was sick, for all the years of our marriage I never did a painting without him looking at it or giving his critique and vice versa. We were very involved in that way, and felt very fortunate. I mean people would often say, “Well, two artists? That must be fiery.” But no, nothing further from it—it was very simpatico.\\nIn that time, as far as our involvement with community, Rich always would do demonstrations for local groups or work within the grade schools where his children went to school. He never went over to universities; he never did things like that. But he did do a lot of work in terms of demonstrating with the children up in Marine’s school and various groups who would call him and ask for demonstrations. He was wonderful that way. Groups of people would come from the Walker or whatever to visit his pottery and he would do demos, and a lot of that went on, always, so his involvement in terms of that community. When we were married we started doing shows here at least twice a year and then there were several shows. He did the Uptown, we did the Marine Art Fair, we did Afton—we started the Afton—we started the Stillwater Art Fair, we did Hudson—there [were] just numerous [shows]. But he didn't travel; some potters travel all over the country. The thing is when Rich was young he got rheumatic fever—his father and two uncles had died before they were fifty-five of rheumatic fever; there wasn’t antibiotics. So he was in high school, he was about seventeen years old, when he got severe rheumatic fever that damaged his heart. And at that time nothing was ever diagnosed, you didn’t diagnose things back then, but he spent a year in bed. So there were health issues early on; certainly by the time he was sixty, he was being diagnosed at that point that there was heart problems. So he wasn't going to start traveling all over the country; he was going to do the focus of his craft here.\\nBut the other thing that he did was the property itself. The buildings never were static, the gardens were never static; we had huge gardens, the flowerbeds changed, he was digging up, putting in, putting in walkways, constantly reworking this piece of property. When I married him it was fifteen acres. When he bought it it was a hundred acres but after the divorce he sold off eighty or some acres, but it was always changing; he did ninety percent of it by himself.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n8\\n00:35:35\\nAW: Did he reflect on why he did that?\\nEA: Never. I think there were a lot of reasons, probably, looking back at the time. He would always say, “I'm not that deep.” Well that was so not true, because he could not hardly stand to go into a place like Perkins. There was not a restaurant, building, anything that he didn't walk into and wasn't doing a running commentary on their obnoxious aesthetics and how nobody had any aesthetics.\\nAnother thing that was very important in his pottery career was he became involved with designers. Then there was a couple of design companies that he worked for that were designers out of Minneapolis, and one had a pottery business and they also sold clay and he would make objects for that. But the other guy did huge jobs for churches and Rich was just about the only potter in the country that he worked architecturally with—the guy that owned the catalog was Grant Gilderhus—and the other guy, he was an architectural designer, so he designed baptismal founts and even alters and the work that would go in them. Rich worked with the designer, would walk into churches and talk about alters and he would do large crucifixes and massive baptismal—St. John's Abbey has his work—and he would do whole communion sets and one of the things that he did was he would do individual communion cups, maybe four hundred. He would be called from all over the world. He did communion ware for Africa; everywhere they called and he would do them. He also would sometimes work for—if people wanted tiles, he would make art tiles but not a lot of that. I think in the Uptown area that building, I don’t know what it’s called, but it still has some of his ceramics that was done specifically for a restaurant. But he did a lot of that stuff and he was very well known for his large work in churches.\\n00:39:00\\nAW: Speaking of that work, you said he grew up in a very strong Catholic household. Did he ever reflect on religion as influencing his approach to his work?\\nEA: When we were married we were not—there was first of all, as a result of the divorce and the changes that were going on in the church, he wasn’t—Rich was a spiritual man, but he wasn’t religious by any means. We didn't go to church. Both of us had Catholic backgrounds and both of us were appalled at the rules of the church with divorce, barring divorce—it was just stupid. So subsequently did his religion have an influence on his art? No. He knew historically—he was a great reader of history—he knew the importance of church and art and that the Renaissance in many regards, you know, the preservation of art as a result of what the church fathers did was important or their benefacting influence in that regard. But no, it didn't have any influence on him. But he had a deep regard aesthetically just for nature, but he was a pragmatist too; it was interesting, he was an interesting man. He loved literature, he loved history, and he never considered what he did as influencing and important in society; he did what he did because it was his process. He didn't have an inflated idea about who he was in the world at all, which was interesting because he did influence people, but he never thought in terms of that, “I have to do this because this is going to be a legacy for somebody.” In fact, his ashes are in an urn the next room; he's shuddering in there that I'm still here, he wanted me out of here, he didn't want me to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n9\\ncontinue any kind of legacy because this was our retirement, we were both artists essentially. I worked part-time as a nurse, but this was how we made our living and so I don't have largesse to keep it going.\\nIn terms of the pottery community, he was very aware—the Ceramics Monthly was very critical, and he was very aware, plus he had a mind like a steel trap so he remembered. There would be sales, and there was not one customer that ever came into that pottery—and he had a lot of people that bought a lot of stuff—that he didn't know when they purchased, what they purchased, and what they paid for it. He knew that sort of thing; it was always amazing for me. They would say, “Do you remember back in ’78 when I bought--,” “Oh, yeah, you bought that blah-blah-blah and you paid whatever for it.” So if they came in and said, “Well I paid this for it,” he knew exactly what they paid for it and they couldn’t argue with him.\\nAW: That’s a question, if his kids took up pottery or his grandkids have taken up ceramics?\\nEA: You know what? He didn't encourage it. [Pulls out photographs] This is the opening showroom, and what you can see in here is the tons of work. No, he didn’t encourage it, although he has a son that’s an architect who lives in Brussels and who has been there for twenty years now: Greg, who is fifty-three.\\nAW: Is he the oldest?\\nEA: Yes, there’s Greg. Julie, who is a registered nurse and lives here in Minneapolis and an up-and-coming photographer, but she works as a nurse but she has great astute eye. Her last name is Abnet. Julie Abnet, Greg Abnet, and then Kevin Abnet, and he's a doctor and he’s a surgeon and an anesthesiologist, lives in Burlington, Vermont. Then there's Christian Abnet who is a scientist who has worked for the NIH now fourteen years and branch manager, basically, at the National Institute of Health. So he's got two sons, one with a PhD, one a doctor. Julie is a degreed nurse from the University [of Minnesota]. Except for Christian, who went to the University of Oregon at Portland, they all went to the University of Minnesota. In fact, when Rich died I got a letter from the then president of the University, because Rich had been alumni. They all have deep aesthetic taste, but he didn't encourage anybody to become an artist because he thought it was too hard, and his wife's father was a doctor and had been the head of the Department of Family Health or something at the University hospitals and that was kind of encouraged more, to go into the sciences, and they all had good math aptitudes.\\nWhat was interesting is that he had more of an influence on my children who were seven, ten and twelve when we got married. My daughter has a degree in art and has continued and worked as an art teacher out in California and has continued to take and took pottery at the University and has continued to take pottery and often talks that, “I can feel dad there with me.” She talks very strongly about how it had been years since she was throwing and she was on the wheel and finally something clicked and she had this overwhelming feeling that Rich was right there with her, guiding her. She also has a direct line to eBay so that if anything of his goes for sale, they immediately contact Jenny. She is buying up his stuff left and right. So is my daughter Megan, who’s an English teacher, and then my son Christopher, who is a family therapist. All these kids love art and art was incredibly important to them, and even when they were young the idea of my A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n10\\npainting they always would say, “Are you selling? Are you painting? What are you working on now, Mom?” It’s what they grew up in; they grew up and art discussion was just part of the family.\\nWhat was interesting about Christopher is that the very first pottery tour show, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago—we went out West. We had bought a Ford Explorer and I had never seen mountains; we had just worked, always. We would only go away for extended weekends. So this was the first big vacation we ever took. We left Chris here because Rich didn't think it would end up being anything. At some point, I think it was Utah, we called to see how it was going and Christopher went, “My God, they come in buses. This is horrible!” He was alone handling that all by himself with all these people coming. Rich was just stunned at how even then, people showed up, people just came, for the Pottery Tour.\\n00:49:25\\nAW: Can you tell us how he got involved with The Tour?\\nEA: Bob Briscoe told me this; he certainly knew who these people were. I think as far as I would know, I don't think this group of potters were hanging out together; they were pretty much individuals doing their own things, except I do know that Linda is deeply involved and she's always over the years gotten grants and done workshops in the summer, done a lot of things like that, you know, traveled and taught, and so she's very involved in that as a woman and a woman of a certain age, you know, very influenced and important in that regard. I think Jeff also did a lot of traveling and grant getting. Now I'm not sure how much Bob did that, and Bob has been very generous in his compliments about how much he was influenced by Rich and the fact that Rich just set up his thing and did his craft and that's what was important. The others—Connee Mayeron is a different level and I think mainly because to me—it’s sort of like when I wanted to find women who influenced me as a young painter and an artist I looked for women that had children and were married, you know, and not necessarily the marriage end of it, but the mother end of it. I wanted to know how those women balanced their lives and how they managed to do that and over the years I would have young women that would graduate and come and say, “How do you do it?” Well, I don't know how you do it; you just do it one day at a time. I did it because it was a generational thing. It's a totally different generation of my daughters--but they are in their forties--it's a totally different thing of women in their twenties and thirties, and yet some things change and other things stay the same and it takes a long time. So Connie, I think, I always felt that she was fortunate enough to have money behind her so she never had to worry about, “How am I going to pay for this project,” or whatever.\\nEvery artist has to figure out how to make art work, what are they going to do to sustain their muse, their dream, and their business—to put food on the table and pay the utility bills, more or less. As a practical farmer coming out of the Depression, Rich, as a practical man who had seen firsthand what happens when things fail, he was going to do his utmost to make things work and he didn't want to align himself with universities because he just thought there was just too much politics going on; that wasn't what he wanted to do. What's interesting is he didn't have that kind of academic outlook, but at the same time he was very much academic because he's so respected and he always talked about Asian pottery. It was always interesting to him that this whole A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n11\\nmovement of potters that started to make pots spontaneously, to mimic the Korean craftsman that would do these spontaneous fresh little bowls that were like quick pencil sketches, they were so fresh and important. Somebody had once said, “You’re digging up these graves and everyone thinks these are great vessels in these tombs.” Well, maybe they’re in the tombs because they were the crappy ones. Anyway, what was important for him was refinement and his work was very refined: in uniform and beautiful, and there was a lot of criticism because it was too perfect and was too refined. And so as the movement in pottery went more towards things more spontaneous, I think that he was never quite understood because that wasn’t what he was about; he was about something much more refined. When he started painting, because his shoulders were just gone, when he started painting, he was so meticulous and such a detail person and it would make me crazy because I was not that way. And I thought, “Just go in there and throw some paint on that canvas,” and he never could approach it that way.\\nHow did he get in [the Tour]? I can't speak to that. I just know that they called him. I think it was Bob. He was also close to Will Swanson, but I don't know. I think it was Bob who called him and said, “This is what we have in mind, would you come up and sit in on our meetings?” So he went up as the senior statesman, what have you, to be a part of it and give his opinion and see how it went, and he was pleasantly surprised, I mean, he just really was. Although when we did shows here people showed up always, tons of people. We did shows in the fall and in the spring and sometimes we did three shows and people always came and bought. And still today people come and say, “Oh, I have his pots. I eat out of that cereal bowl every day and I love it.” That never turned his head; he never thought of it in terms of that it was because of him. It was just that he did a job well done, that’s just the way he looked at it.\\n00:57:30\\nAW: On that note and getting back to some of his early experiences here. So had he taken a class in ceramics before Warren MacKenzie’s class or that was the very first time he had any experience with ceramics?\\nEA: No, he wanted architecture.\\nAW: Did he reflect on that class? What did he say about meeting Warren? You said he really was changed by that class; any more specifics around what was it about Warren’s teaching?\\nEA: Warren also had an aesthetic that he admired and I think that it all collates with this being the son of a farmer, living close to the land, and the idea of working for yourself and making a craft was just completely what did it. He wasn’t ever a follower, and he talked about that and I'm sure in the class he didn't speak—I mean, he and Warren knew each other. Over the years, Warren has had students that he's been closely aligned with, but Rich wasn’t going to be closely aligned with anybody. Rich was his own person and he was going to go off and he was interested in doing his thing. He respected, again, the discipline and what Warren always taught about the beautiful pots that were being designed to be used and to be made and to be functional in a home and that whole movement, influenced by Bernard Leach, where Warren had worked, that whole philosophy was very important to Rich and not far from the whole idea of being an architect: working, doing something that influences how a person lives, perhaps. But I don't know, he A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n12\\nwould talk about it better than I am talking about it, which I feel bad about; too bad he's not here. I feel bad because I'm doing it in such a limited level.\\nAW: I wanted to follow up: so when Rich was in the Marines and then came back and decided to pursue school and then took the ceramics class, what was his degree in from the University of Minnesota?\\nEA: His degree would've been in Art as a BA, it might have been a BS.\\nAW: So that’s what he finished with at the University of Minnesota and then he went to Rochester. What did he talk about what his parents thought of any of this? What was that like?\\nEA: Not good. This was the early Sixties, they were appalled, and when he bought this place they were appalled. The tragedy though was this was twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, and his father died of heart disease at fifty-four and a disease from rheumatic fever that would eventually take Rich’s life. They would come down here and they could never—even his brothers—they would come and say, “Well, how is the pottery going?” These weren’t uneducated people. In one year three brothers died all together and a son-in-law so Charlie had died first and then Greg and then Rich and then Stewart so within a very short time four men of that family have died. Except Charlie, who did not have rheumatic fever, Rich and Greg both had rheumatic fever; it was cancer that killed the other two brothers, actually three brothers. So they all respected but they didn't understand, and I get that completely, I get that completely. When I graduated from high school I wanted to go to the Minneapolis Institute of Art and I was roundly told by my parents, “We are not having any beatnik in our family.” A beatnik, really? It was so discouraged. You will do something practical because, who cares?, you’re only going to get married and have kids anyway. It would be worse now but back then you expected it almost.\\nYou weren’t being supported but you didn’t know a whole lot of women that were being supported. Most of your high school friends—some were going off to college but most of them who would never finish would get married and have babies. Or if they did, you have to remember, it was only a few degrees open that were really practical. Women became teachers, they became nurses, and they became secretaries. You didn't know a whole lot of women that would individually go off and become doctors; you had to have a very unusual family that would support you in doing that. And then if you are in any of those areas and you got pregnant, God forbid, or were married and got pregnant, you had to quit work because you could not work pregnant. I just retired from nursing. I was a licensed practical nurse because I said, “I'm not going to become an RN because I am going to work my way through art school, with just this minor degree.”\\nActually I’m glad I got that degree because it sustained us as far as health insurance. Many artists we knew never had health insurance, which we were very fortunate to have; we were happy about that. I only worked part time but it also gave me a broader sense, you know, you don't get too wrapped up about what is working and what isn’t working. At any rate, it was years before anybody knew I was an artist and then it was like, “Oh, you paint? My grandma paints.” You just didn’t go there. These were different things. And then by the time I left young nurses or young women would come up and say, “I saw your stuff at a gallery around town, you really are an A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n13\\nartist aren’t you?” The thing is with other artists I can discuss it, but unless you really go live in the warehouse district and are working and living in a community of artists like that you just don't go talking about it because I was of the generation that when my parents first went to shows that I was having—now his mother painted and was a poet and his father was a lawyer and there were doctors and lawyers so these weren't uneducated people. They were all, way back then, very educated. And I said, “Well gee, Dad, you didn’t say anything about the artwork?” He said, “Why? You know it's good. I’m not going to give you a bigger head than you already have.” I say this because Rich understood that implicitly. What's interesting about it—and this probably had a lot to do with the greater influences in terms of his first marriage—his children barely asked him and barely talked about art with him. I think that had a lot to do with his first wife. But it was my kids, particularly my daughters, that really respected and they all do, you know, now, in hindsight, but he didn’t over talk about that. We’d talk about it here and there but it's sort of like, it's the process: don't worry about whether it’s good or bad, it’s the process that's important; you do it because you need to.\\n01:08:30\\nAW: It really sounds like a lot of social pressure at that time, family pressure to not go into this field. So for both of you to have pursued this is as you did is really incredible.\\nEA: But even today I will have family members or friends who will talk about children with creative, or deeply creative leanings, and they kind of go “Eww,” like it's a disease—not a lot of people, but still, you don't meet a lot of people that want their kids to become artists. The first thing you’re going to say is, “How are you going to make a living?” You can’t even make a living now barely as a historian. When Christian, who is forty-seven, got his PhD he immediately went back, he got a degree in biology. Even back then there was not a lot of stuff going around, jobs, so they said, “Don't get a Master’s degree, that's not going to get you anywhere. You have to have a PhD.” So then his wife, I love Rebecca's degree, she has a PhD in feminism and literature with a leaning in science fiction. So I go with her to Madison to WizCon. Anyway, I’ve learned a lot by Rebecca. But were there jobs? Well, she could become an English professor but they had children and she devoted herself those first ten years to those kids; then you have to bide your time and do stuff on the side because you become nervous as a woman thinking, “Well, ok, I’ve got to keep a foot in the door,” because you become irrelevant. I’ve worked with young women all my life of course in medicine and I work with, have worked with, very young women coming out being obstetricians because I worked in OB. Then after about five years they want to have kids and they go, “Why did I go into this business?” Because basically as advanced as we are, you’re still doing the majority of what’s at home, they’ve proven that with statistics, you’re still earning the money, making the meals.\\nAW: I think that’s really important because that’s come up in our other interviews with Linda and Connee—the kinds of challenges they faced not only as potters striking out trying to make a career with pottery but as women potters trying to have that all happen. I think it’s good to talk about that and also talk about the continuing issues we’re facing.\\nEA: I’ve read things over the years and it’s pretty interesting—I remember reading, in fact, an interview with Ursula Le Guin, who is a writer of science fiction, one of the first. WizCon is A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n14\\ninteresting to go to because it is heavily feminist. What you go and find is that especially within the science fiction genre, there are so few women and they are being fought against by the men, who have dominated science fiction, and now minorities, you know, black women and black men trying to break into and be relevant in the science fiction genre. It’s so fascinating. Ursula Le Guin, in these interviews said, “Historically, artists,”—she was talking about writers but it could be across the board, any kind of artist—“Men or women: the women would put their heads in ovens if they ended up with children, like Sylvia Plath, or the most successful men or women eschewed children, or stable relationships. They just didn’t because you couldn’t. You could barely, barely do it.”\\nFor my own art, it’s been hard enough to paint since Rich died, since my muse died, and the man that was the only person I ever met that said, “You are an artist, you can do this, do it.” When I quit working as a nurse because it was a discipline like all right, “I'm working these days so this day I’ve got to be in the studio.” My art always took a backseat, always, a backseat to everything, the house, the kids, and I just knew that that's what it was. If you get crazy and angry you’re never going to do anything. You have to just do what you can do because if it isn’t those things it will be something else. It can be health; health can kill you. Life is going to throw you curves. Rather than sitting around worrying about it, you just don’t know. Life threw Rich curves and he would still go out in that studio. And then to make himself energized he went in his yard or into the house and built. In the wintertime I used to say I would go to work or go up to the studio because it would be so cold sometimes in the barn he couldn’t work. He wouldn't teach through January and February; he’d start teaching again in March and he would start creating again because when it was really bitter, firing the kiln was not practical so he wouldn't fire. He would have a month or so when he would take off and so then he would come into the house and start cleaning out cupboards and cooking and cleaning. I was like, Wow, I’m so lucky. And I worked with women at the hospital who said, “Oh I hate it when so-and-so gets in to my kitchen.” Really? Not me. Anyway--\\n01:16:15\\nAW: We were talking about his family’s response. So his father died pretty young, and his mother?\\nEA: His mother lived to be in her 90s.\\nAW: So she saw his career progress?\\nEA: Yes she did. How he turned this place around, she saw that. I remember once when we were first married and of course he was very private, nobody knew circumstances. His sister has about forty degrees and was a very singularly independent woman, really different, lived out in California, always worked as much as she could. She was always getting a degree in this or that, and she was a fanatic birder. She came here once with her mother and they were looking around at all the stuff and it was sort of funny, his mother said, “Look at this man: is there anything he can’t do?” And I said, “Well yes, as a matter of fact he can't hold a tune and he can't dance.” They just looked at me; they didn't think it was even funny. Certainly by the time—they all bought his pottery, admired his pottery; he would always give deals and all the children had a set A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n15\\nof dishes. In fact, when he started getting sick, that was one of the things that Bob Briscoe and I worked on because when he died unfortunately there was over three hundred pieces of unfinished pottery in the barn and most of it had been formed on the slab roller, because he couldn’t throw anymore because his shoulders were so gone. He had had numerous shoulder surgeries, worn-out rotator cuffs, so he couldn’t throw basically because there was nothing left.\\nHe was making things with slabs and forming and he had three sets of dishes out there. After he died I kept trying to get somebody to help me bisque fire it, and then I finally started bisque firing on my own, not in any gas kiln, but in the electrical kiln. Slowly with help from—actually the summer after he died, I had this potter from Iowa come up, and did a workshop here through the science museum—it was wonderful. Then Linda would come down, Bob would come down and Will would come down, but these are busy people and they couldn't do it. Finally Bob said, “Edie, just bring it up. We’ll do it.” I didn't care if it was his glazes I just wanted it done. I needed to settle for these kids getting their dishes. So I got a friend who had a van and we put all eighteen massive containers of his glazes and all the pottery, hauled it up to Bob's, and in one afternoon Julie, myself, my friend Dave and Bob and basically it was just three of us, but we glazed all of it. Then it was going to be a huge snowstorm. They went back because they had to work and so I stayed up there and went there early morning to help Bob load the kiln, and we started it up. Two days later I went back up there with Dave, we put all the glazing back in and all the finished pottery, so we opened up [the kiln], and I have pictures from that.\\nSo, me and Bob, we just got it done, and Bob was very involved in this very seminal, important thing and he was a very generous man and we were all happy that this got finished. There’s still stuff out there that I was going to do this June that haven’t been finished but I have a show now at the Stillwater Library, and because they’re mainly big art pieces, I don't know what I want to do with them. They’re big pieces and raw bisqued and they’re so sculptural, I don’t know. Some of them are down at the show in the library.\\n01:21:35\\nAW: Wow that's really an incredible story to get the last pots all glazed. Those were ones for his family or for the kids?\\nEA: For the kids, right. It was a huge deal; in fact, there was this young man who was a filmmaker. He’s a teacher and getting his PhD; he does the Square Lake Film Festival; he’s done it for 10 years. He was going to do a film on it because he remembers coming here as a child because his parents bought a lot of Rich’s work and going into the showroom and the kiln was firing and he, [Paul], said he said he must've been six or seven--it was such a vivid memory--that Rich pulled out a piece of what was called a glory hole and so this firebrick that you can handle that it's like foam, but the one end was like burning ember but it doesn't transmit the firebrick and he showed him. [Paul] remembers how it never left his mind that you could hold that brick in that fire and the expression in his eyes, that twinkle in his eyes. I feel bad that I didn't pursue it more with him, because he did want to do a film of finishing those pots, and I didn’t pursue that as much as I should have.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n16\\nAW: Well, a busy time and a tough time it sounds like right after he had passed, so it must have been a really tough time to be doing all of this stuff. But speaking of this young guy, you said his parents brought him here. Who came to the studio early on in his career? Who was the audience for Richard’s work? Where were they from? How did he build up an audience over time?\\nEA: They were from the Cities. He did a lot of shows and he sold a lot of his work in Minneapolis and he worked as an instructor at MCAD. He did shows in small galleries all around town at that time and he was just recognized as a good potter. He was always recognized as a gifted potter, always.\\n01:25:00\\nEA: Paul Creager is the filmmaker. Paul Creager, remember that name and you’ll see he’ll go far. He is an independent filmmaker and he works closely with film in Minnesota and he is the man that is establishing the Square Lake Film Festival, which has been going on for two years, and he's such an interesting young man. Now he and some other people have taken over the Lumberjack Days in Stillwater. I don’t know if you’re familiar with it but this guy that was running it started absconding with the money, wasn't paying bills, and might go to jail. So they didn't do it for a number of years and they wanted to do it again, the Chamber of Commerce, and so they had people make presentations. Three people made presentations, and two of the people, two of the companies, were turning this festival, Lumberjack Days that had been a small community thing. It was wonderful; there were a lot of small community activities going on and it turned into some big biker, big-name Rockfest stuff that nobody who lived in town wanted to go to town because of this stuff. So Paul and some other local people said, “We want to do it and we want to bring it back to its roots,” and it is going back to its roots; another wonderful history thing. When I've have had fundraisers for ArtReach Alliance, which is run by Heather Rutledge, ArtReach Alliance is a very community-based art organization that is important in terms of how the community of artists throughout the Valley, which interestingly, you know, when Rich was alive we just did our thing and raised our kids. We were in the community but it wasn't the focus to drag the community into the awareness of how important art as part of life should be. But since he has died it's because of Heather and Paul and Guillermo and I was involved with the pottery tour this year because I had people staying at my house. In fact now since he died I always wanted to get a potter back in here and it never worked out. Now a young potter is coming who’s worked up in Two Harbors—it's just trying to figure out how I can open the pottery again, I don't know how I’m going to do that.\\nAW: It’s an amazing thing to try for.\\nEA: I really want to do it but the logistics of that. This is the problem: where is he going to live? Do I open up the house and say, Yeah, you can live with me? The thing is I've been alone for a while, do I want that? And then it gets back to, well, a lot of people would do it. Linda would probably do it. Here I am, I do want the pottery open. It's like trying to be a farmer nowadays: they have to have a place to live, they have to have another job, and they can't come from the Cities and do that economically, it just isn’t going to work. So where would he live? How are we going to work this out? I don’t know. I would like it to work but I don't want this young man to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n17\\ncome here, he’s twenty-six, and not be aware that maybe in six months I might go, “Eh, this isn’t going to work, you can’t be here, this is not going to work.” That's not fair, so I don't know.\\n01:30:26\\nAW: Well maybe a trial run of some kind, just to figure out if this is going to work. It is a big commitment particularly what you were saying about sharing the studio with Richard and how that space is really meaningful to you. And you continue to paint in the studio?\\nEA: He built a studio for me; I’m up above and he was down below. I don't care about having someone in here; I don't want to make it a mausoleum to Rich. I want it to function; the only way that barn is going to stand up is if it keeps activity in it. When activity goes in there, when Sally did that workshop in there, it was wonderful. Just last week I had the kids in there, a couple of my grandkids, we were making slab pots. It needs to be somebody working in there. It's the rest of that, how to make that work. It's pretty basic out there, there's no running water, Rich hauled water; there’s a rain barrel with water and they’d have to come use the toilet in here. None of that bothers me but it is not like he can be out there and there's a toilet; it's got a furnace, it’s heated. But he sounds just thrilled with it, but he still needs a place to live and he probably needs a part-time job, besides trying to make pots.\\nAW: Have you thought about looking into the art grants around, or has he thought about looking at grants to see if you could maybe get something?\\nEA: Well no, we haven’t. But at the most it would be $10,000 for, how long is that going to last? There could be, there could be some options, right.\\nAW: You’re in an interesting time here where you’re trying to figure out what’s happening next.\\nEA: The first three years I had a young pottery couple that was going to do it, but then she got a job as a curator out in Arizona so they went out there, and another young man came along, and then none of it ever panned out. I’ve even had women sort of like Joan Mondale, women who liked to make pots, but they want to come down to places like Northern Clay, they don’t want to come all the way out here, and they don't like the idea of no running water back there.\\nAW: I'm sure something will get figured out; this is too beautiful a place for the barn to be empty.\\nEA: Well actually there's a couple of thing that I sort of backed away from, I didn't want to do, but now I have another woman coming on Friday—so funny after three years, and I think it's become more critical because I don't work anymore and I don't have that basis of income—who is a wedding planner, because people want to get married in spots like this.\\nAW: What do you think Richard would think about that?\\nEA: You know what, in the few months before he died, he just wanted to say, “What are you doing here? What are you going to do?” because we hadn’t gotten out of here, he got too sick. I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n18\\nwas very emphatic about how I was going to be okay, that I was going to turn this into a business that it was going to be okay. And he was like, “Ahh, get out of here.” But he just got sick too fast so we couldn’t get out of here. Plus I really believed that the move would just kill him. So we didn’t leave and here I am, but we never thought of being here forever—this was like a farm; it was to be sold and this was retirement income. The thing is that these size properties are not selling well. Home sales are not really great yet. There are six homes for sale just in Marine not even half this size. He said don't give it away, well there's a lot to—I have a leaking roof, too.\\n01:35:50\\nAW: You were saying a little bit earlier, initially he wasn't really as involved in the community or didn’t seek it out.\\nEW: We started art fairs, he worked in schools, and he would do workshops in schools when they called. There used to be a lot of state money for that, artists in residence programs in grade school—I did a lot of through that the museum in St. Paul. There was money for artists to go into schools and teach for an hour so that they would get art credits and that was really big in the 1990s and in the 1980s. But then it all went away, and there used to be another thing that really hurt the art community was that corporations used to get tax credits, and so did artists, for artwork and you could get tax credits as an artist for art you sold. Now they only give you credit for material. So they screwed every which way they could, and so it’s wonderful that there is now this legacy grant for that.\\nAW: But I’m curious about the community’s response to Richard’s work?\\nEA: They loved it, and over time they definitely did. He was wonderfully charming and was a great demonstrator, but I would freely go up to schools, and this was interesting, he wasn’t terribly hardnosed about it. This is what bugged him, that the schools needed the artist just to come in but they didn't pay you anything, they wanted you to just do it. I always did it where my kids went to school, and I did it in other places. They might give you some money but basically they didn't, and he didn't like that.\\nAW: Tell us a little bit more about the Tour over the years, like how the first year you said you headed out west and your son Christopher was here and had to manage it. What happened the next couple of years?\\nEW: He would go to all the meetings and become involved. As it developed there was—as time went on there was a relationship of camaraderie developing that meant a lot to him, that meant a great deal to him. He really started to develop it with Will Swanson and he really liked these people. It meant a lot to him. Then, of course, I think the last ten years of his life, he had been part of the pottery tour for twelve years and I want to think that it might've been 2005 maybe; he went to 2005 or 2006. I can't remember. He was getting sick and I think inside he knew he was dying, he was a dying man, and he said, “This is what I want to do. This is not what I want to do,” and he had just decided. First of all he couldn’t throw, and what’s interesting about all that is that he had an incredible pain threshold, so he never said, “It kills me to throw.” He never would say those things, he would just say, “I just can’t do this anymore,” so you knew he was in A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n19\\npain. It really moved him when he had to announce to people after one year, after one of his pottery tours, that it was his last: he couldn’t do it anymore. I think Linda started crying and he just was overwhelmed by their emotion for him—it meant a lot. The pottery tour meant a lot to Rich because he was involved with potters and working with the community more so than he ever had. He had always been pretty alone doing this so it was a real important step for him and their friendships meant a lot. He was always amazed at how big it was getting and it was growing exponentially every year and he just couldn't get over that.\\n01:41:35\\nAW: Who were some of the regular customers? Who were some of the people coming during the Tour?\\nEA: He had regular customers that came all year round. We could never be in that part of the house; we’d always have a dog that would bark. We had fun little dog at the end: Max. And Max was great, he would bark, bark, bark and then we would know someone was out there and he would stand in front of the birch, and he would stand and look at the house and bark his head off like, “Hey somebody is over here, get over here.” He was so funny.\\nBut I think it's because he did a lot of shows in the Cities and he did a lot of one-man shows at galleries and he built a reputation that way. It wasn't so much the Valley that was supporting him in the beginning. Certainly certain people from the Valley would come; even when we were married in the Eighties, the preponderance of his customers came from the Cities, came from Minneapolis. Locals did not buy his stuff, which I found interesting because he always was very adamant about going to the local garage and local grocery store, local hardware store; he was very adamant about keeping things within the community. But I think that art in general, it's like whenever painters have an art show, whenever I have an art show, it’s the same old people that always show up, same people. There were never new people when I have a new show ever, maybe one or two, but it’s the same people that buy art and show up, thank God, in support.\\nAW: Why do you think there wasn’t much support? Who was the community at the time that Richard moved there?\\nEA: It was pretty agrarian even back then, over fifty years ago—that was pretty agrarian. So of course there was Marine on St. Croix, which had a reputation for sort of a bedroom community of wealthy people because they lived on the river, just like White Bear Lake would have been a bedroom community of wealthy people. A lot of people that lived in Marine or bought into it had cottages or homes on the river and lived other places. But the other half were the working stiffs, so there were some people that bought in the town and some of those wealthier people would invite us to certain goings-on and Richard always laughed and said, “They wouldn’t have anything to do with us if we weren’t artists.”\\n01:45:13\\nAW: So did he start seeing a shift, though? Now that the art shows are here?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n20\\nEA: That shift has come in the last ten years.\\nAW: How and why did that happen do you think?\\nEA: Well maybe little more than ten years. Stillwater, when I was growing up, I remember the big flood of ‘65 and I was a senior and nobody wanted to go to Stillwater—it was just like a black hole. Then it became a river town and people had a little more money and a little more time to spend and art fairs started developing in the Seventies. In the Seventies and in the late Sixties, but particularly the Sixties, art fairs started in the late Sixties developing across the country and at that time an art fair, you didn’t go and find anything but high quality painters and craftsmen. That was just the real beginning of the whole craft renaissance. So how has this developed? There are people that still get out and about, but there are still a limited number of people that buy. Pottery is different; pottery is functional for the most part. You buy it and you can use it; it's like a woman and jewelry: you can always find a reason to spend the money. A painting is a totally different ballgame. Usually people who buy paintings are buying them for themselves. A lot of people buying pottery buy them as gifts. You’re not going to spend $400, $500, $1000, $2000 on a gift for somebody, unless you have a scad of money; you just don't. You just buy pots.\\nI don't go on the pottery tour regularly, for one thing Rich and I were too busy, and we would never would go on—although they tried one year, this was the kicker, and Bob always feels so bad about that. They decided one year that they were all going to visit everyone’s studio. Everyone was going to stop and we’d have a little something to eat and just visit the studios. So we went around and nobody showed up; they all said it, Rich took them at their word, but nobody showed up except Bob and a couple of his guests. Everybody else was just too busy and it was just one of those deals. Poor Bob always has to apologize for that, that’s so funny, but it's amazing how many people show up for these. I had potters stay with me for this pottery tour, and the thing is ever since Rich died I would always say whatever I can do, if someone wants to live with me and create pots in the studio, then whatever. This is the only year that somebody really did anything. Then I went up there to this paella dinner that he had and Warren MacKenzie and his wife were there and a lot of those acolytes and a young man that had just gotten a Fulbright grant and had been in Taiwan for six months, and they were all this community of people interested in each other and warm and talking and it is something I never witnessed with Rich. I think this is a new thing, maybe not. But when Guillermo and Bob do the pottery tour they have an eight-course meal—this takes scads of volunteers. They’re not doing it on their own. They have a huge number of people that come in and work for them for nothing, prepare food, make food, donate food. For me it was like to really finally get it, what Heather Rutledge—who runs ArtReach Alliance—says, “It is a community, it is striving for the community that makes art successful, makes a better community, it is all of us together, it in enhances, enriches, improves relations in cities and towns.” When people do this sort of thing. It has to be advertised and emphasized that this is what this is about and you see that in action at those two places, and I don't know that anyone else puts on the food.\\nBut when they first started the pottery tour—now there’s the Southern pottery tour, there is the Western, the Eastern, there's pottery tours all over and they were certainly one of the first in the Valley and now it's become huge. And it's really interesting how it's grown and how it's A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n21\\ndeveloped and thousands of people, they fly in for it; you’re just not going to have that for a painter because the money involved is just so totally different. But you can buy a pot for $40 or $15.\\n01:53:00\\nAW: Why do you think it grew so much? Why has it been successful?\\nEA: It's a beautiful area, it’s a destination, they’re feeding you for nothing at two of the places, you can go to the others and go get something to drink and then you can have a meal at Bob's and Guillermo’s. I don't know how they do it. But I don't know that that's the only answer. But I think it is a conflagration of all kinds of things that happen and then once it starts snow-balling it has a life of its own, it's just exponential, and the mystery of it just begins. So then it always gets great press in the big newspapers, now it probably gets national press because it's huge. How do they explain it?\\nAW: Part of it is getting everybody together and joining the mailing lists certainly then opened everybody up to everybody else’s mailing lists. That opened up the amount of people that might come visit a studio. That’s one of the reasons. It’s interesting that just changing the brochure to a full color brochure made a big difference. I can’t remember for sure but the amount of visitors doubled in one year because of that. The power of marketing—you find the right kind of thing that speaks to people and they flock to it. The number one answer is the quality of the work—that that’s what keeps bringing people back and people tell other people, “Come to this. You’ve got to check this out.” That’s been something too. The guest potters—they bring more and more, the guest potters bring their own groups of customers and networks. Did you guys bring guest potters too? Did Richard have any guest potters?\\nEA: No.\\nAW: Why was that?\\nEA: Because he didn't have a huge community and he was getting sick. If he was only in it for twelve years, first of all you just see how it goes, and then you realize you just can't do this anymore because he couldn’t make pots and his health just wasn't there.\\nAW: Actually if we could talk about his health for a little bit. You said at first his shoulders? Is that common with potter?\\nEA: I don’t know if it was from throwing, although Bob Briscoe has had rotator cuff repair. It has to do with the fact that you're handling huge amounts of weight and Rich worked like a stevedore, he was a very strongman. When I had my rotator cuff repaired they talked about the acromion, the orthopedic surgeon said, “Well, you have a shoulder and the acromion is this bone that comes out and here’s your joint and this is all covered by cartilage. If you’re lucky, your acromion is out like this. If you’re not lucky, it goes like this.” That’s the way mine is shaped. The more curve you have in your acromion the more impingement and problems if you’re A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n22\\nphysically, extremely active. Musicians end up having serious problems with that repetitive motion disorder. People don’t think about that but if you’re doing eight hours of music a day.\\nBut he had serious heart issues from the fever and after we were married about ten years it became evident. He had high blood pressure and certainly was on medication by the time he was in his early fifties and was being medicated and he would have halter monitors and tests. He had a huge, enlarged heart. What's interesting is a lot of the real breakthrough cardiac medicines were just coming into being in the Eighties and Nineties and, again, he wasn't talking about his health.\\nHe didn’t talk about his health: he never complained. That man, he went through two open-heart surgeries that most people will never survive psychologically let alone one open-heart surgery—he went through two just because he has such a high pain threshold. When we got married, I lived in a little rambler down the road and I had a huge 1880s upright piano, it was beautiful and had a sounding board and it literally weighed five hundred pounds. When I got the movers to come and get it they took apart that beautiful piece of furniture, destroyed the piano, and still couldn't get the sounding board out of the basement. By that time I should have just told them to smash it because you’ve ruined the piano. Rich single handedly grabbed that sounding board and humiliated those guys and said, “Listen why don’t you do it this way,” and he showed them how to haul it up the steps and the guys just sat there letting him do it by himself, this five hundred pound sounding board. Finally he said, “Would you come here and grab this?” So that didn’t help his rotator cuff but he always worked. I think that the fact that he did work so hard, so consistently, probably helped him live to be seventy-seven years old. He never smoked, he never drank and he was extremely physically active and always thin.\\n02:01:25\\nAW: When did he stop doing the Tour?\\nEA: I think it was like 2005, 2006, something like that maybe?\\nAW: When did he pass?\\nEA: In 2011. He may have done it up to 2008? I think it was 2007 or 2006. The last two years he was really ill.\\nAW: When he stopped doing the Tour had he stopped most of the art shows by then? Was the pottery tour one of the last things to go?\\nEA: Yes it was. He stopped throwing, he couldn’t throw anymore and he just started painting. By seventy-three he just knew without ever saying anything, he never said anything. The only time he ever said anything was one time when we went out to visit Christian in Maryland and we're getting in the car and Christian was walking around and he put his head down and just started to cry. It was so awful, and he said, “This is the last I will ever come back,” and it was such a stunning statement. He was right, he knew he was dying and that he didn't have that much longer and this is what he wanted to do, he wanted to do his yard work and paint, and that’s what he did. Within those last five years we made one last trip to Europe to see his son Greg. But when the pottery tour would come up after that we didn’t go. He used to say we would have this A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n23\\ndiscussion because he wanted us out of here; he didn't want me stuck with this place. I wanted him to just be able to die here and then I said, “I’ll get rid of it myself; it'll be a cathartic thing for me to slowly get out of here.” And now here I am, three years later, still wondering what the hell am I doing? What am I gonna do? He wanted to know that I had an idea and that sort of helped but he would say, “You don’t understand, I don't need this, I can walk away from this.” He said, “You’re the artist, you’re the one that has to always create, not me. I can do many things but you can’t, you only do one thing.” And he would always say that, “No, you’re the real artist.” I always said, “No, you can’t walk away.”\\n02:05:32\\nAW: Now that you’ve talked about your background too: Where were you born? Did you grow up in Stillwater?\\nEA: No, North St. Paul.\\nAW: When were you born?\\nEA: In 1947.\\nAW: And when did you develop a passion for art or painting?\\nEA: I don’t remember, always. I drew from the time I could hold a pencil, that's all I ever did. That’s all I ever wanted to do. That's all I ever did. I grew up in a household that appreciated art but not so much doing art, like painting or pottery, but they loved literature. Opera was in our house all the time. Music was huge in the house so opera always was big. My mother and father were basically first-generation immigrants; my mother was first-generation Lithuanian; my father was second-generation Scotch but his mother went back probably to Plymouth Rock. Basically I grew up in a household that had heavy accents and spoke in universal terms. They didn't speak in terms that were provincial. But still they were not forward thinking in terms of what they wanted their daughters to do. They believed in education and they weren’t going to say, “No you can’t,” but they thought women ended up getting married anyway.\\nAW: How many siblings did you have?\\nEA: There were six of us; I was the youngest of six so I have a brother that’s going to be eighty-five in the fall. The gap was sort of interesting; Rich and I were thirteen years apart, but my parents were older than his parents so there was no generational [gap]. We grew up Catholic, we grew up with parents that had gone through the Depression and we grew up knowing World War II. We grew up of the same mind. It wasn’t like there wasn't some big difference between us because of the age. I have nieces now that are ten years older than their husbands, which I find delightful in some regard though I can’t imagine marrying a younger man. (Laughs)\\nAW: So where’d you go to high school?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n24\\nEA: I went to high school in North St. Paul and then I went to St. Joseph’s School of Practical Nursing and then I went to the University of Minnesota, but I didn’t graduate from the University. As far as art goes—I always wanted art so my mother—when I was in grade school I would take the bus into St. Paul Art Academy. A couple years, I would take classes in there. I was always taking art classes. I took art when I was at the University—of course that was when everybody was stoned out of their mind. That was in the height of abstract expressionism so classical atelier study was out the window. They just thought it was dead. People like Rauschenberg and those kinds of painters—they just felt like non-traditional painting. It’s funny realism is gone but now it’s coming back: photorealism. Abstraction isn’t so much “it” anymore. It’s a combination of medias that is now important in art. Mixed media—audiovisual, performance art, it’s really interesting what’s going on nowadays. It’s a huge variety. I don’t know how anybody makes money now.\\n02:10:55\\nAW: They do. I think certainly technology has helped.\\nEA: In terms of selling, yes, exactly.\\nAW: Did you guys run a website?\\nEA: No, it was so funny. He wanted a computer so we got a computer. Then he was the one interested in it but then, of course, I was advancing on a computer because I worked outside the home, and you had to use a computer at the hospital; that's how everything went. Then, interesting enough, when I was at hospice I had really hurt my shoulder so I couldn’t go back and so I went back to the hospital and I became secretary and then that's all computer work; and now that job’s completely changed, so at sixty I changed a career there, more or less. Since then I've been all over the map lately.\\nAW: When did you start working as a nurse?\\nEA: In my early twenties. When I was married the first time I had stopped--we were having children—and then I went back into nursing when Rich and I were married. Both of us—our previous marriages—were married and had the insurance, so somebody had to have the insurance so I went back and worked as a nurse part-time and then we had health insurance, so I did that right away.\\nAW: And your art—you said you went to the St. Paul Art Academy, doing all kinds of things as a young artist?\\nEA: For a while I lived in Oklahoma. I went down there and I would take classes down at the Gilcrease Center for the Arts. That was real influential on me because I met working artists and I would take drawing classes. I would, at night, go up to these big figure studies classes and I was so young—I graduated from high school when I was seventeen—and so then I was eighteen/nineteen and everybody was a lot older than me and I was just young. But they were so A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n25\\nwilling to impart their wisdom. I would go to these live drawing classes and it was all nude models, my God—it was amazing. So that was a great influence on me.\\nAW: And when did you start producing paintings? When did you have your first show?\\nEA: I started producing paintings in my first marriage. I started taking classes—I took a class in watercolor with Judy Blaine because I couldn't work—I had a reaction to oil and I wanted to do something that was easy cleanup—I was always the practical one—and I had children so wanted to do something that was easily cleaned up that I could set up and take down that would be immediate, and I thought of watercolor. So I would get these videos from the library and then I would take every watercolor class that I could get my hands on. They have big watercolor three-day workshops. I did that all the time. I would see these videos from watercolor artists on the West Coast—and at that time the American Watercolor Society was pretty strident how its approach to watercolor—everything had to be translucent in the classical so-called English style of plain air painting. But these California artists from early on did what they damn pleased; they used chalk, charcoal, wash, and they did all kinds of different things when they painted. And that was so appealing to me and drawing—what I preferred most about watercolor was the real visceral fact that you held your objects right in hand and that they dried—it was just very appealing to me.\\nSo I started selling—my sister, we used to have a little antique shop and I would frame up and do paintings and sell it there. I would walk into galleries just with a portfolio of my work and just say, “Look at my stuff,” and they would all—I would go down the list and ask for appointments and they would let me in and laugh me out. That happened again and again. They would ask things like, “Do you have a degree?” and I would say, “No.” “Well, how do you think you’re going to compete? You can’t even draw.” Constantly doors slammed in my face. I just kept trying and trying and then me and a couple of women did a little tiny art show. This was before the Marine Art Guild and I think actually we started the whole idea and I would sell my paintings for like $17. In fact people have come up to me and said, “I have three types of your paintings.” First it was Edie Vendel, when I was first married and then I would sign Edie Vendel Abnet, and then I signed Edie Abnet. My father was very disturbed—because his mother was the painter—that I didn't keep my maiden name. When I divorced my first husband I went to a woman lawyer because there were abuse issues with my first marriage, so I found a woman that was used to handling abuse situations and she said, “So you paint? Well why don't you bring your work in and let me see maybe we could do a trade.” So I traded art for her services and she handled my divorce for basically nothing.\\n02:17:30\\nAW: So what brought you to the Stillwater area and Marine on St. Croix?\\nEA: My first marriage. There was a place for sale; he worked for 3M. My brother had moved out here and his wife and they had talked about a little place further towards Marine that was for sale and it was very reasonable. I had gotten money from my parents from the sale of a cabin we used to have and so we bought it and that's how I got to the area. I just would slowly sell my things at—I would go to art shows. Rich got me—when he first got involved with the Art [Guild], he A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n26\\nwas doing a show out at Apache Plaza, and Apache Plaza had a national reputation. There's this famous—it’s in Indiana, what is the name of that University in Indiana? It had a famous art fair, big national reputation. At any rate, he would sell out—Apache Plaza is over by Fridley—he would almost sell out in the first four hours. People waited in line to buy his pots and so when we first met he said, “I know the people that put this show on. I think you should get into the Apache Plaza show.” So he opened up venues for me in that regard and we used to drive there and laugh; we were friends, we were good friends. So that's another beginning of how I just started doing it. And I would paint at night after the kids would go to bed and I would just start painting.\\nAW: And Richard would be in his studio all day?\\nEA: This was before Rich. The end of that big room out there was my first studio and so I painted here. And then after maybe five years, when he decided he wanted to tear the old house down and make that addition, he also started building the studio above the pottery for me so that I was able to move up there. And that's when I'd be upstairs and he would be downstairs creating art. That was now quite a few years.\\n02:20:25\\nAW: I find it inspiring the kind of connection you guys had through art and craft that you were making.\\nEA: It was inspiring. It was special. I know a few widows and I feel—I think basically from pretty early on we knew Rich had a bad heart and we had been through so much with both of our bad marriages that we never took anything for granted with each other and we knew it was a gift: that relationship that stimulated him, stimulated me, stimulate our creativity, our art—it was special. Rather than I wanted more of it, my attitude is, I was lucky I had what I got. So few people have those connections. So few people ever find their soul mate, not that it's blissful throughout the whole thing because it wasn't; it was very difficult with seven children and the insanity of the spouses that you dealt with and didn’t know what you were dealing with. We worked hard at everything but we also know we had been given a gift. Although in one regard, people would come in here and look around and say to Rich, “Boy are you lucky.” If they only knew, he said, “Luck has nothing to do with this. This is hard work.” I don't know if he would even correct them but it was one of those things that made him crazy. It’s the same with relationships. People will say, “Oh, you’re so lucky you have talent.” Well talent only takes you so far; brains, anything only takes you just so far—you have to work at it. Nothing else will follow if you don't apply the sweat equity. Why is the pottery tour successful? Because of the sweat equity, because they work really hard. And you go up there and there's so much work and so that nobody goes up there and just does nothing. Then they get volunteers who simply love it, to work as hard as they do. Somebody said to Woody Allen once, “What does it take to be successful?” And he said, “You just show up. That’s all it takes.” That’s not all, but for jobs or anything, you just have to show up. There are a lot of people who can’t even do that.\\nAW: I think you’re right on with sweat equity. Just hearing from the interviews we’ve done how much time has gone into preparing for the Tour, managing the Tour, when they’ve brought guest A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n27\\npotters in how to make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. All of that is a lot of work but it seems to have created this amazing tour here.\\nEA: I wonder what's going to happen because Bob talks about retiring. Jeff talks about retiring. I don’t know how old Jeff is, but Bob is exactly my age.\\n02:25:20\\nAW: Do you have hopes for the Tour in the future?\\nEA: As you would have hopes for art in any community you have to keep giving back. What's interesting too is—have you ever been up to the Franconia Sculpture Gardens? That has taken off—again, another sweat equity. But what helped establish them was a wonderful financial base, the Cowles, and then the sweat equity followed and the enthusiasm followed. Obviously just throwing money at something isn’t the only thing. How will they replace?—that’s what’s going to be careful. Now when Rich left, they got Guillermo—wonderful, and wonderful who he brought in—so it depends. But none of them are thirty, the main group of those potters. I wonder as a group do they talk about it?\\nAW: I think some are starting to talk about this but Bob is definitely reflecting a lot on this and thinking through this.\\nEA: Yeah, and he had said—when I was up there and we were finishing Rich’s pots—that he was hoping that a young potter will come in there. How young? Does he have money behind him so he can buy your place? I know hard it is has been—and I get it, you get it better once you’ve tried. It will be interesting to talk to this young man.\\nAW: I think you’re touching on something here that the personalities of the people who started the Tour, the potters—they’re not replaceable. Is this something that will sustain beyond those original founders?\\nEA: Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever and you have to love something and it just doesn't; my years in hospice taught me that and you have to accept that. You can try but just nothing does.\\nAW: How has the Tour served as a model?\\nEA: It has served as a model for what can be done when people work for a common goal—when art is a basis. Art enriches a society, a culture, a community. It improves finances, it educates, it gives depth. When they first opened China to the Olympics after it had been gone they did little film vignettes of everybody—and what was interesting was the Chinese have the attitude of looking holistically at the human being. One of the important aspects of a human being is their spiritual and creative needs. Every human being is creative, but it's what happens in a culture to that creativity.\\nNow the pottery tour, certainly, it is feeding that basic need that people want of things that are original, hand made, of the earth, that more and more our society falls away from. Now that you A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n28\\nhave terms like the holistic attitude, you have mindfulness, maybe clichéd, but there is an important mindfulness about loving a beautifully made pot and looking at it and looking at its nuances and putting it to your lips and knowing that a human being made that. There used to be people that would come in here and say to Rich, “I can go to a garage and buy a mug for five bucks. What makes you think I'm going to pay fourteen bucks for this mug?” So there's this whole discussion of that, Well right, but you can't educate that attitude—well you can, what you can do is hopefully maybe if not that individual but their child. And we have taken away art in schools. We have said it isn’t important. We have said it's not a part of who we are as human beings, and yet people flock because they really do need that. You can walk into the plainest downtown Minneapolis apartment and it is depressing if they have nothing on their walls. If you throw up a few paintings it alters that rectangular room. Why is that? You walk into a hospital, and if it has art on the walls it is comforting—even for somebody who was a total rube that has never paid attention to anything in their lives, they feel it. People feel things even if they don't know why they feel the way they are feeling—I mean, if they walk and they can’t even describe unaesthetic places—but people have a sense in neighborhoods if everything is painted beige with four car garages right in the front on the curb with no sidewalks and they walk into a 1950s neighborhood with sidewalks and no garages and a big old elm tree—they have a sense of something, it's as simple as that. And hopefully something—if not the pottery tour—but then somebody else's tour will keep going; art will improve.\\n02:33:56\\nEA: People can harp all they want about young people; I think that there is sensitivity and a communal feeling in young people that is very impressive to me. They talk about cell phones but I have a sense that they are establishing a contact and a basic sitting-around-the-fire-telling-stories sense of togetherness that in generations past they didn’t even think they needed it. But now these young people are creating, they’re calling it, “This is my tribe,” or whatever—and it's not simplistic; it's wonderful how they hold onto each other and talk to each other, and I’m not saying they’re all perfect. So goes art. Art does that for you. Beautiful things do that for you. I went to visit my daughter—the little artist lives in Albuquerque—and they have a balloon fest in October, hot air balloon fest. Five hundred hot air balloons go up in this massive valley before you go to the Rio Grande. You get up at five in the morning and you go down this valley, and it's shoulder to shoulder and the mountains—the sun is coming over the Sandia mountain—and these brilliantly colored balloons are filled with whatever the gas is, and you walk on them and there is such a feeling of joy and love I have never felt—well I have actually—that feeling of everybody was happy and you could feel it, it was such a vibration. When you go to a beautiful performance—I was just at the Matisse show—when you're up at Bob Briscoe’s, when you're in those atmospheres, you'll feel more whole as a human being because it's the truest sense of it is going on. Although, you know, a good Twins game when you’re up in the grandstand of that beautiful stadium, that's also pretty exciting. My son who has lived in Belgium twenty-plus years—Rich’s son—and he brought his daughters and Marianna and he said, “Europe doesn't have this sort of thing. First of all, they don’t encourage sports with young women. You can pay for it but you have to pay for it. There’s nothing in the schools. There are, but they’re not as common. The fact that everybody of all ages, of all social economic polyglot go in to watch a Twins game—there’s a ninety year old and a five year old—nothing like that exists in Europe.” I mean they have football, they have soccer, but they don't have the age—they don’t have the huge A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n29\\nvariety because they can be pretty rough and tumble, so it doesn't appeal to as many across the board—I mean it is hugely appealing, soccer, of course, to bazillions of people, but it is different than going to a Twins game.\\n02:38:20\\nAW: There is something about bringing everybody together to enjoy one sport together. Earlier you mentioned other tours and other shows?\\nEA: There are a lot of tours that go on now, especially in the spring.\\nAW: What is the boundary of the St. Croix River Valley?\\nEA: There are no tours that I am aware of that go much beyond Harris, which is Bob and those guys. But then it goes all the way down to Prescott and that’s the end of the St. Croix River. The St. Croix River starts somewhere in northern Wisconsin, but that's wild river—that’s all forest and wild river. But the river all the way down to Prescott—there's art fairs down there because that's where it empties into the Mississippi River. Hudson's is great because they have the Phipps; there is a huge art community that goes down to River Falls. There's some nice art and pottery and River Falls always had a great art program too, the University of River Falls.\\nAW: Do you think the Tour has influenced some of those other shows?\\nEA: Oh, of course, absolutely. Everybody wants some of the action.\\nAW: Do you have a sense of what the Tour has meant for the local community in various ways, maybe financially or in terms of supporting local artists? What has the Tour meant for the St. Croix River Valley?\\nEA: Well of course the potters are feeding them so they’re not going to restaurants, but that's probably not true. I know how you measure that but I don’t know. When we did the Marine Art Fair, for example, we would limit it to seventy-five artists. Now it's close to three hundred and it's a mayhem, and nobody goes up there because they say its all schlock and the town hated us. You don't have that kind of attitude any more. That's how things have changed in the last twenty-five years. You go from small communities that don't want these sorts of festivals, but now they come to people like ArtReach Alliance, and Heather Rutledge down there put on a workshop, but they talked about the community connection and how to get art festivals and how to get communities involved in the arts and how it is better for everybody. You're certainly familiar with southern Wisconsin and all the little restaurants and pizza places and how huge that is. They've got all these little breweries and cheese places; people from Minneapolis can't wait to go down there and there's these places that are set up for just pizza and beer—and the idea of doing weddings here. So things are just moving in that direction of basic stuff, making things with your hands, being out in the country, it's beautiful out there, those are beautiful places to go, and even if it's raining they like to go up there.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n30\\nAW: We’ve heard from others about the weather. Did the weather ever affect the showing of the audience, the various people who would come or not? There’s all kinds of weather the Tour has experienced being in early May.\\nEA: I don't think it's ever affected them that I'm aware of. How did the Tour do this year?\\nAW: I think they did really well, maybe as good as or better than last year, even though it was rainy and cold.\\nEA: I know that I've heard Bob talk about that it was like half his income; it’s just huge what they do.\\nAW: This is good. I think we’ve covered a lot. There are one or two reflecting questions so this might be hard because I’m asking you to think about what Richard might reflect on. What do you think pottery meant in his life?\\nEA: It was a way of expressing who he was. Pottery expressed his need to make things with his hands. It expressed his relationship with the land and with his environment. It enriched and fulfilled him.\\n02:44:48\\nAW: And I’d like to ask you too, what has painting meant in your life?\\nEA: It saved my life. I think Rich could have done a lot of stuff, but painting did save my life. I can still up and work and I always feel better when I work, and when I don't work I don't feel good, but I've got to be more disciplined. I could work my way out of a lot of bad stuff. Art always helped me express myself and it's not that I do stuff that is necessarily socially relevant—I do decorative things, but they’re original to me.\\nAW: Thank you for sharing that. You’ve talked about some of this already but any final thoughts about your life here with Richard or about Richard’s work or about the Tour and what the Tour has meant for you guys?\\nEA: Actually I didn't think much about the Tour. It’s just now meeting Guillermo, and the Tour became more important after Rich died. What was interesting about the way he and I worked was—you didn’t pot because of the Tour. He didn’t make pots because of the Tour and Richard wasn’t making half his income at that point. The Tour has really taken off the last twelve years or ten years. It was always up-and-coming, but it’s just grown in the last—what would they say? It’s always successful, but it's just really gone beyond their wildest dreams lately. I think that's the thing, but it wasn't like, Boy, we’re onto something big here. We never had discussions like that because there were pretty critical things going on at that point. I think that those are questions that have become more relevant with the Tour of late, you know, post-Rich. I think it's wonderful and amazing what art can do in a community and what it means. I think everybody should stand up and take notice, but still it's the pottery tour so that there's a lot of people that don't know anything about it, just basics of it. I bet if you go down to the Marine Brookside Bar A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n31\\nand you sat there and talk to people they’re not going to talk about how wonderful, “Boy, what the pottery tour does for us economically.”\\nAW: So there’s still some kind of separation between the local community and the Tour?\\nEA: Yeah, in general. I'm sure there’s a huge portion of people that work at the hospital who have no idea about the pottery tour or if they've heard about it at all but they don’t think about it in relevant terms or how has it had an impact on the Valley; that’s historians or the potters themselves. First of all there never were this many potters in the Valley. Now it's sort of like every other person you meet is a potter, for God sakes. (Laughs) How many potters live in the Valley? It's just huge. There weren't that many potters even ten years ago. Guillermo hasn’t even been here fifteen years. It was Rich and Warren MacKenzie, and Warren was a university professor. Is that a function of the pottery tour—that there’s so many potters?\\n02:50:45\\nAW: That’s what we’re trying to find out.\\nEA: There are a lot of things that have gone on too. St. Croix Falls has a huge arts center, The Art Barn, and then there's festival theaters all over the place. I don't know that it's just a function that it’s potters, but art is going on more and more. The Worm Farm—have you ever heard of the Worm Farm? In this little southern Wisconsin town how The Worm Farm is sort of grown like the Mayday Parade. The woman that runs the Heart of the Beast Puppet Theater just got a huge thing, basically it’s [a McKnight Distinguished Artist Award] for what she’s done in a community—it used to be this little tiny parade that’s now huge; even Vietnam Vets want to get involved now. So these things start creating a life outside—you know, the pottery tour, of course, it's good for local businesses, but it is other things happen. One time a woman showed up at the Marine Art Fair and she said, “How do you get into this?” and Rich said, “Well you make something. You're an artist. What do you do?” And she said, “Nothing, but I'll think of something.” There is sort of that that goes on. I get six flyers those two months around the pottery tour of various things going on. Now fall is coming up and they never did anything in the fall but now they don't have a pottery tour, but the artists, they have individual shows. There's this snowball effect that's happening.\\nAW: Did Richard ever compare the ways that the art shows happened and the Tour happened, or any kind of differences about how and why they worked and the relationships between them?\\nEA: I think for one thing artists have always kind of known that people love to go to artists’ studios and see where people live so that in itself is a critical component to the pottery tour. Initially you’d think, “God, gas is so expensive. Why do you want to come from south Minneapolis to drive all the way up there?” Well because it's interesting to see how these people live and then to see other potters. There’s the quality and there's the food and even if it's raining, who cares? You're seeing where the wildlife live; you’re in their environment.\\n02:55:00\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nE. Abnet\\n06/23/14\\n32\\nAW: That’s a really important point of what is bringing people.\\nEA: Oh people love to look, “Can I see where you paint?” “Sure.” They do, it’s important. You know it’s like how they preserve writers’ places; you want to go in and see where people created their works, sat at that desk, where’s the typewriter, what window they looked out, what they thought about—to look at environments. They look at those environments because they imagine themselves working these humdrum lives and so they go in and they see these different environments and they wonder if they could do it and they know they couldn't do it: the whole mystery of what an artist is; it’s all fascinating for people.\\nAW: I think so. I’ve certainly enjoyed getting to talk to everyone and to see where they’re living and working. I’ve learned a lot more about the people behind the crafts that they’re making. We’ve taken up a lot of your time. Thank you for sharing your stories and your memories. Is there anything else that you want to share or we should know?\\nEA: I talked more than I ever thought I would. A lot of your questions I wish I could answer them better. I know in general the impact to questions like how is the pottery tour impacting our community? It's impacting it in an obvious and not so obvious and subtle ways.\\nAW: Well thank you so much, I think we’ll end the interview here.\\n02:57:35\\nEND OF INTERVIEW\\n\",\"transl\":{},\"fullrs\":{},\"find\":\"102.pdf\",\"dmaccess\":{},\"dmimage\":{},\"dmcreated\":\"2015-02-12\",\"dmmodified\":\"2015-02-12\",\"dmoclcno\":{},\"dmrecord\":\"101\",\"restrictionCode\":\"1\",\"cdmfilesize\":\"363751\",\"cdmfilesizeformatted\":\"0.35 MB\",\"cdmprintpdf\":\"0\",\"cdmhasocr\":\"0\",\"cdmisnewspaper\":\"0\",\"page\":[],\"id\":\"p16022coll44/101\"}]", "geonam_ssi"=>"http://sws.geonames.org/5048815/"}, {"id"=>"p16022coll44:105", "setspec_ssi"=>"p16022coll44", "collection_name_ssi"=>"American Craft Council", "collection_name_tei"=>"American Craft Council", "title_tei"=>"Interview with Robert (Bob) Briscoe, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_ssi"=>"Interview with Robert (Bob) Briscoe, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_sort"=>"Interview with Robert (Bob) Briscoe, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "title_unstem_search"=>"Interview with Robert (Bob) Briscoe, A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley, Minnesota", "contributor_teim"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_unstem_search"=>"Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer); McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)", "contributor_ssim"=>["Wilhide, Anduin (interviewer)", "McNabb, Tierney (project assistant)"], "creator_teim"=>"Briscoe, Robert, 1947-", "creator_unstem_search"=>"Briscoe, Robert, 1947-", "creator_ssim"=>["Briscoe, Robert, 1947-"], "creator_sort"=>"Briscoe, Robert, 1947-", "description_tei"=>"Robert (Bob) Briscoe (1947- ) grew up in Kansas City, Kansas and studied pottery with James Vandergriff in Zarah, Kansas, then with Lou Wynne in Colorado Springs, before moving to Minnesota where he established his pottery studio and co-founded the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour.

This interview is for the “A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,” made possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb [Project Assistant]. Bob, thank you for agreeing to be interviewed. Let’s get started. If you could, tell us when and where were you born? Where did you grow up?\\nRB: I was born in Kansas City, Kansas in 1947 and I grew up in Kansas City, Kansas. I went to high school in Kansas City, Missouri college preparatory school for boys called Rockhurst High School. Really excellent, Jesuit preparatory school. Very tough. I wasn’t probably as smart as I needed to be for that school but it was good for me. I lived in Kansas City until I was nineteen. I moved to Colorado to serve in an apprenticeship with a couple of potters in Colorado Springs and then came back to Kansas City in 1971 to—I had fractured my knee and I had no money and I had to come limping home to my parents. When that healed I decided to get a job and save A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n2\\nmoney to start my own pottery. I did that for six years and saved every penny and got married in the middle of that, too, to Johanna Von Meyerhauser. We’re divorced now but we’re still best friends. She’s now Jo Severson and she’s still a potter now. Anyway, we had a studio in Kansas City during that six years and then we bought property in Minnesota just because the land was cheap. Minnesota had no other attraction to me other than there were winters here, which I really wanted to get away from Southern heat. My father had been in the National Guard and he had trained every summer at Camp Ripley in Minnesota—literally the only connection I had to Minnesota—there were no pottery connections, there were no art connections, there were no friends; I knew nobody here. We just moved on a lark. We bought land by Little Falls, Minnesota and built a studio and house and started out our career as potters. Pretty much failed immediately. First I got a job bartending at a little tavern nearby my place there. Then I got a job at the Brainerd Foundry and worked there for a year and a half. Worst job I’ve ever had in my life. Most interesting job I’ve had outside of pottery, but it was medieval at best. Physically, the most demanding thing I’ve ever had to do at a daily basis. It made being a potter look like vacation, and being a potter is actually fairly hard, too. I quit that job in 1978, and I’ve had no other income but pottery since. That’s kind of my general history. I’ve been a professional potter ever since. I’ve been selling pots since 1971, but I didn’t consider myself a professional until 1978 when I made the leap.\\nAW: Can you tell us more about what it was like growing up? What your family was like?\\nRB: My father was a manager of a grocery store at a local Kansas City chain—a small chain. Very family oriented business. Our whole lives were surrounding his job. He worked all the time. He started out as a sacker at this store and worked his way up to be a manager and eventually, after I moved away, he became a Chief Operating Officer or something like that. My mom—stay at home mom. There were four brothers and sisters and my grandmother lived with us in kind of a Catholic, blue-collar neighborhood. Art was not part of our lives. I think my mother wanted it to be, but we were just blue-collar to the max. She was sort of a writer. She was published several times but minor things. I think she probably would have been good at it if she hadn’t been a mom.\\n00:06:00\\nAW: What were your parents’ names?\\nRB: Vernon and Charlotte. She was all Irish and he was Dutch English. We had a huge family, mostly on my mother’s side. My father didn’t have any relatives; they were all dead. My mother had hundreds and it was a pretty tight-knit Irish clan. There would be a Fourth of July party would be four hundred very closely related, almost no other ethnic people. One of my aunts married a Polish guy, and that was the shock of the family that she married someone outside the Irish race. They weren’t rude—I mean, it was more kind of fun but Matt Portaberry (??) he fit perfect and he was a hilarious character, so they couldn’t do anything to him. It was a good environment.\\nAW: Had they grown up in Kansas City, too?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n3\\nRB: Yeah, they were born and raised there. My father left to go to the war, that was it. They had no desire to leave. After he retired they went to Ireland for my mother’s sake—she was chasing down her family history because it was important to her. None of my siblings were into art. I have a sister that is a medical technologist and married a cellular biologist, a brother who is kind of in sales of medical equipment, and a younger sister who works in human resources for a big corporation in Dallas, and my younger brother became a kind of world-renowned macro-biotic teacher and philosopher: David Briscoe. He’s written books and he’s really quite the famous fellow in that world.\\nAW: Where do you fall within the order of siblings?\\nRB: Right in the middle. One each above and one each below.\\nAW: Tell me more about your early education experiences.\\nRB: I went to a Catholic grade school and went to an all boys Catholic Jesuit high school, which was very discipline oriented—not military school type—but rigorous academics. I played sports. There was no art program at school, absolutely none. I don’t think we ever talked about art. I’m not even sure the word was ever mentioned. Their whole focus was to get you to go to college, and ninety-seven or ninety-eight percent of them did from that school. It was a really, really good school. I got a really great education there, and it taught me a lot about the academic search. You kind of went to school, you went home, and studied. I mean, I was out of breath the entire time I was in high school. I was up until ten or eleven at night trying to get my homework done. I don’t remember if there was a day that I went to high school that I wasn’t completely terrified of being unprepared. But I enjoyed it.\\n00:10:00\\nAW: How did you get into art and ceramics especially?\\nRB: I went to a junior college that was in my neighborhood—Catholic, as well—I don’t even know why that’s a theme, but it is—but it was cheap. It was $140 a semester, and I could walk to school. It was taught by Benedictine nuns, and I had an art appreciation class that I didn’t want to take, had no use for it. They had a young woman professor who’s husband was the sculpture professor at the Kansas City Art Institute and so she would bring in students from the Art Institute to do demos—drawing, painting—and one of them happened to be a potter, and I was flabbergasted by it. He demonstrated it. My first reaction wasn’t, I want to do that. It was, I want to have some of it. I like to cook—I’ve always liked to cook so I thought, These pots would be great, you know, for cooking. I started seeking out pots. I didn’t have any money, but pots were cheap. There weren’t very many potters, actually. I found this one fellow named James Vandergrift at a little craft art fair in Parkville, Missouri, and I bought a couple of coffee cups from him. Later, I saw him at another event and bought some kind of serving bowl. He suggested that I come out to his studio and give it a try. That was like, Really? Me? So I did, and it was a blast; by the end of that summer I went every day. I worked from three-thirty to midnight, and I’d get up at six in the morning and I’d run two miles and I ‘d take a shower and then I’d go out to the studio and I’d work all day until two-thirty and then I’d drive to my job. I did that. I was A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n4\\nterrible. At the end of the summer I wasn’t a whole lot better than the first day I went there. But I had completely put on the mantle that I was going to be a potter the rest of my life. I was nineteen, and I was smitten, as much as you could be smitten. That was the summer of my first year at Kansas State University. I only went there because they had a bakery management school and, within the bakery management school, they had a restaurant management division. My plan was to learn restaurant management, go to France, learn to be a cook, come home and open a restaurant. That was my big plan, which I’ve always been grateful that that fell through. But I took art at Kansas State, but I couldn’t take ceramics until I had Design 1, Drawing 1, and there was some other class that I had to take. Again, I didn’t want to take any of this. I just wanted to take a pottery class. Finally, the next semester, after I’d worked at this place over the summer, I went and I signed up for ceramics and changed my major to—around that time I was in the College of Commerce—I had decided to give up on the bakery thing—I was in the College of Commerce and I hated it, and I transferred to the Arts and Sciences. I ended up getting a degree later in economics, but I also took ceramics, every course they offered. And, Design 2, and you know, whatever else they made me take. It was a good experience. A guy named Angelo Garzio was the ceramics professor, and they had two or three other professors: Eric Abraham and—can’t remember all of them. Anyway, the Vietnam War was raging and I was actively protesting the war in Vietnam, and I dropped out of school to do that full-time because it was really the other passion. I went out to Colorado and I apprenticed with a couple—after I dropped out of school—for another year and a half out there, named Lou and Al Wynne.\\n00:15:30\\nAW: How do you spell that?\\nRB: W-y-n-n-e. He was a painter/potter and she was a potter. She taught junior high art. They took me on as an apprentice and it was a really wonderful time. It ended a little badly over a minor thing, so I went on my way. That next year I went back to Colorado to Fort Collins. I had really loved Colorado, and I went to Fort Collins to be a—I was thinking of going to school there but it was so expensive I just couldn’t—out of state tuition—so I thought, Well, I’ll just become a resident and then I’ll get cheaper tuition. In the meantime, we formed a group at this gallery studio. There was a leather worker, a candle maker, there were two potters and a photographer. Out of the basement of this big gallery we ran classes and had an arts center, of sorts. We all had fantasies of buying a building together and—I was never a hippie but it was kind of that alternative living stuff. And then I broke my knee right about then and had to leave. At that time, the sum total of my wealth was a 1964 International Travel all that had no windows that were not broken and a potter’s wheel and whatever clothes I had on my back. I moved back to Kansas City to heal, and then get a job. I got a job at the grocery company that my father worked for in the produce department, which I liked. Eventually I became the manager of the department, and I did that for six years. It paid well and I was able to save a lot of money and buy land in Minnesota. As soon as we had the building built and the land paid for, we had no debt and we moved up here, in September. And, by January, I had no money and I was looking for a job. I think that brings it up to the Minnesota phase here.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n5\\nAW: Yeah, thank you, and if we could go back a little bit. When you had this moment when you realized you were smitten with pottery—why do you think you became so? Over the course of the summer, you just realized this passion? Tell us a bit more.\\nRB: I think there were some real distinct reasons. I think because my parents wanted us to not live their life, you know; they didn’t want us to work with our hands. They wanted us to go to college—they didn’t get to that. My mother did eventually. My father, you know, he renovated houses and then would rent them out. We all did the work with him—painted the houses, fixed the plaster—but he would never let us do any of the mechanical kind of things: the wiring, the plumbing, all of that. We’d just hand him tools. I think there was a desire to work—the hand part. I think when you finally start realizing that you can actually make something from your imagination with your hands, you start seeing the possibilities. You can start visioning a life of being in control of what you do with your time. Also, because of my mindset about Vietnam and the lies that were being told, you know, government, and family, and everything about—when you’re nineteen and you wake up and realize that there’s a big lie being told. I’ve always used the analogy it’s like seeing your father walk into a motel with a strange woman. Suddenly you’re like, Wow, you’re life kind of falls—the bottom falls out. In pottery, it was like I could be the person who controlled the lie. If somebody was going to tell a lie, it would have to be me. That became really important to me, besides the joy of actually imagining something and then putting it into three dimensions through clay. That in itself was huge, but if you put this other set of circumstances around—and then, when you get into making pots and then you start building kilns, start designing the materials—you become a carpenter, bricklayer, an engineer, a chemist. All of those things in conjunction with being an artist, and then, later you then have to have business skills—it just felt like this complete package, and that was new. That felt really good. It felt like you could be a whole person and it felt authentic. I can’t emphasize enough the idea of who’s telling the truth. You can live your value system through being a handmaker because you’re describing what it is to people; they’re buying it, they’re using it. You can hide anything, but, you know, you’re the person who’s doing that lie. It’s really important to me: my values are.\\n00:22:30\\nAW: I think that’s so interesting the way you’ve put it and if you could say a bit more about that. What would be the truth? Can you say a few more words about that?\\nRB: Somebody asked me one time, “How do you price your work?” and I think that question is wrapped up in this answer. You imagine the exchange between yourself and another person. They’re clearly wanting something that you’ve made, which, right away, is almost payment enough, just the fact that they want it. Second of all, you know how much time you have in it and the cost of materials and your life and your mortgage and all that. So you balance what you give and what you receive. Where it feels like it’s valuable in both directions, then, that’s the price. It might be less than other potters are charging, it might be a lot more. You wrap all it up in your own set of values about the world. I don’t spend a lot of time in the studio thinking about the business part. I’m not pure about it, but that’s kind of my place where you make from the joy of making. I don’t conceptualize a product, you know, where I’m going to manufacture something that will be a hot item, or, I know people will love this. You do it for yourself, and then you figure out how to sell it. You try to do it in that order as opposed to figuring out what will sell A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n6\\nand then make that. If you give enough time to it you actually start knowing things. But like I say, I’m not a purist about it; I’m doing this to make a living and I get to do it on my terms, which is huge. And the art part of it—I probably haven’t talked a lot about art because art was never part of my growing up. It was never part of any direction we were pushed towards or offered, so the art part of it is always mystery, and always will be. I don’t consider myself an artist, but I do consider myself on the path to making art but whether I have? I don’t know. That’s one of things you strive for. Art is a really difficult plateau to achieve because it’s really rare, I think. I think in some ways we give that title to too much, too easily. And I think that it’s something that—I’ve seen it. I’ve felt it. I’ve seen it in museums; I’ve seen it in friends’ of mine’s work; I’ve seen glimpses of it, maybe, in my own work, but it’s a rare thing.\\n00:26:30\\nAW: What would be the pillars of a piece that is art?\\nRB: This is oversimplified, but there are some things that sort of vibrate the space they’re sitting in. They’re not neutral. They’re not passive, they’re active. Sometimes that can be a really good design, could be a really good color or whatever, but when all that comes together and the piece has presence, it’s unmistakable, whether you made it or somebody else made it. You walk through a museum and ninety percent is like, That’s amazing. That’s wonderful. That’s a handsome thing. Suddenly, you’re stopped in midstride and you’re like, Wow. That’s kind of how I see art, but it’s individual. The art piece has always been—I wouldn’t say a struggle, but it’s an achievement that I think you point yourself towards.\\nAW: Hmm, interesting. When you first realized you were passionate about pottery, how did your family react?\\nRB: They were horrified. You can imagine two parents have five children; they didn’t get to go to college; they grew up in the Depression when they were hungry on a daily basis. And then for someone who is in college, looks like the brass ring is there for you to grab, and you thumb your nose at it—I’m sure they were really dismayed. Well, they were. But when you know, you know. Actually I was surprised a lot by their reaction because I thought they were really cool about raising us to be individuals. We weren’t to tow some kind of line. They kind of liked that we were all different personalities and they applauded that. But, when you actively choose to go in that direction and to see them react—I mean, they weren’t negative, but their advice was to do something else. My father—who for years said, “This is great. I’m behind you all the way”—on my forty-seventh birthday he called me up and wished me happy birthday. At the end of the conversation that was probably thirty minutes long, he said, “Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you: are you still thinking about graduate school?” [Laughs]\\nAW: [Laughs] He’s still hoping.\\n00:30:00\\nRB: I’m damn near fifty and he’s like--\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n7\\nAW: --“Have you thought of these other options?”\\nRB: You’d think by then they would have figured it out. But there was a lot of trauma in the beginning. My girlfriend at the time dumped me because she thought I was wacko. I had a falling out with an older brother. My parents were just—I mean, literally, they would come to my house in Kansas City, which was only two or three miles from their house where my shop was, my studio, and they wouldn’t get out of the car. I had to meet them down on the curb. I would sit on the grass and talk to them through the window of their car. I always thought they just were not willing to approve. If they came up and, you know, looked at the studio, it would have been a sign of approval on their part and they weren’t going to do that. It didn’t matter. I used to sit there and smile. I’d tell my wife at that time, “Yeah, my parents are here. I’ll go out and visit them down at the curb because they won’t come up.” I thought it was humorous. It wasn’t going to change me. This was—it’s real clear to me right now: those emotions of you knew what you were going to be doing the rest of your life. Really lucky.\\nAW: I would say so, just to have that clarity of mind and purpose at such a young age, that’s amazing.\\nRB: Yeah, and there were no potters. That was the other part that was weird. I couldn’t point myself at a model. A lot of the arguments I had with my father was, “Show me an example.” I couldn’t. All the ceramics people that you would even look at were all professors. They all had a job at a university somewhere. There were no potters that you could find in 1967 who were making a living. I think they were out there, but they were very few. There might have been a few in North Carolina, you know, the traditional little potteries. Dotted here and there, there were people that were making the same decision. I think there was a cultural wave going across the country because of the Vietnam War because when I started doing art fairs in 1971, and more seriously in 1974 and 1975, there were a lot of us. There weren’t a lot of potters, but there were always a few potters in every show. Those were really interesting times because everyone was in the same boat. There were no books. There were literally two books that you could put your fingers on that had any information about being a potter, [about] any technology. It was Clay and Glazes for the Potter, by Daniel Rhodes, which came out in 1967, I think. Then there was Bernard Leach’s, A Potter’s Book, which was published in 1934 and then republished in the United States in 1950, I think. That was about it. Then Rhodes came out with a book on kilns maybe a year or two later. Then there was a little more stuff starting to happen. You go to an art fair and if there was another potter at the art fair, you’d hardly ever spend any time with your own pots. You’d just spend time talking to other people. “How did you get that color?” “How do you fire?” “How do you this?” “What kind of kiln do you have?” “What’s your clay formula?” People were really generous. We all were, in both directions. The whole thing was building fairly rapidly. I never really thought of it as any kind of pioneering,. It’s just like, Well, if there aren’t potters, I’ll just invent that person. I didn’t want to be a teacher. Nothing against teachers, I just I had no passion for that idea. I really wanted to be this independent, in my own space, telling my own truth on my own terms.\\nAW: That you were able to build that in a place where there weren’t a lot of examples is really a testament to being resilient in your sense of self and sense of direction.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n8\\n00:35:00\\nRB: Yeah, when you’d find someone it was just like a miracle: Wow, somebody else. Then it became more common; then you realize that there’s probably some kind of cultural phenomenon happening here. I think it was the Vietnam War that, you know, people were waking up—I was born in 1947 and so the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit—I don’t know if you ever read that book or not, and there was movie by that title—that was kind of the world that you were going to inherit. Then there was the movie of The Graduate, where the guy takes Dustin Hoffman aside and says, “Let me give you some advice,” and he said: “Plastic.” I think that was the world that we were supposed to inherit and I think a lot of people thought, Nope, I’m not going to inherit that world; I don’t want any part of it. You know, most people did but it was just—to me, it was an offer of money, and 2.3 children, and a house in suburbia. I just wanted to explore some other paths, and if I ended up getting to the house in suburbia and the 2.3 children, that would have been fine too. I would have had no problem with that, but I would like to have done that on my terms, as well.\\nAW: Some of the tension in your family that you had mentioned—was it also around the Vietnam War or was it mainly focused around your decision to choose pottery?\\nRB: I think it was both. My father was a career military guy—you know, National Guard. He was very heroic in World War Two. He was a bombardier pilot and he was shot down three times. It was really a big part of his life. And here’s his nineteen year old kid is, you know, taking the opposite view. He kind of came around. I think the truth started coming out about the war, so he was less dismayed about it. My older bother, on the other hand: we never saw eye to eye since then. We were actually kind of friends. He had gone off to the army and when he came back he seemed like a changed guy. We had never been close, but suddenly we were going on double dates and we were having fun together. Then, my stance on the war was just unfathomable to him. Also, choosing to sneer at my college degree and go off on this path, he just couldn’t figure it out.\\nAW: So, in two ways you really decided what you valued and cared about and moved ahead in that direction. That must have been tough to not have the support of your family.\\nRB: You know, it just seemed like what everybody is supposed to do. You live your own life. I never thought it was any of their business. They weren’t funding anything. I respected their opinions. I always thought my father was a really smart fellow, and I never thought of him as from another generation that just couldn’t fathom our generation. My mother was very smart. She was a sweetheart.\\nAW: Another thing that you said that I thought was interesting for understanding the historical context of the time—you said the idea was that people were being pushed to want the 2.3 kids and suburban lifestyle, but that wasn’t really the lifestyle that your parents had, or was it? You said they came from a working class culture. You felt like there was that pressure there, even then, to live in the suburban lifestyle?\\n00:39:44 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n9\\nRB: I felt like it was a pressure, you know, the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit sort of view of the world. I think my parents—a inner city neighborhood or suburban neighborhood—they were no different to them. Having a big gang of kids, you know, that was your job. Not just because they were Catholics, I just think that was the norm, you know the formula: you get out of school, you get married, you have children, you move to a bigger house, try to get a better job, you know, better yourself. But even back then, there was a lot more respect for—if somebody were the parks keeper or the janitor at the school. There wasn’t this kind of pressure like I think there is now to be somebody, a big deal. I think people gravitated to where their skills were. To show you how old I am, we had gas lights in Kansas City on one street. It was like the last street. It was Sandusky Avenue, and there was a lamplighter. There was a guy that, every night, he would walk, he had a little ladder he put on his shoulder, and he had a little tool, and he would climb this little short ladder and he’d lift up the lens and he’d turn the gas off. I think they only had those gas lanterns because there were probably only two guys left in the city, you know, they were going to let them work until they retired. As soon as those guys retired those lamps were probably were electrified. I don’t remember that process but I remember walking along with this old guy who was a lamplighter. Everybody tells me, “You just imagined that,” but there were several of us. We kind of chased the guy around. We just thought he was a character, and we’d follow him down and he’d like light five lamps and then we’d leave him alone. We weren’t pestering him; we were just interested. I’ve always respected people who did what they wanted to do. I really like people that work with their hands. They’re not all wonderful people, but I respect it. It’s hard, it’s hard to carve a life. I had a friend of mine, who is a photographer, and we were at an art fair one time and there was a young potter who came into my booth and asked me a question and I got talking to him. He wanted to know about one of my glazes and I gave him the formula. He walked off and the photographer said, “You just gave him your formula?” And I said, “Sure.” And he was there for about an hour, we were talking, and another young guy came in and wanted to know my slip formula. And I gave it to him. And he said, “I don’t get you guys. Potters are crazy. Why are you giving away your secrets?” I said, “Well, because anytime you recognize somebody by their questions that you know that they’ve gone through enough ceramics to ask that question, you know they’ve failed miserably a lot, and, so, you respect that because they’re still doing it, even though you know they were getting their butt kicked regularly. Ceramics just does that to you. If you survive it, you have to respect it.\\nAW: How so? How does it kick your butt?\\nRB: A pot can fail at every point in the process. You can drop the pot, you can squeeze it too hard, you can crack it, the materials change. I mean, they mine this stuff with shovels—big scoops—and you know, small limestone rocks will fall into it and if that gets into your clay you fire it, then you put the pot in the kiln and it blows the side of the pot out—a little speck of limestone, you know, that you couldn’t see with your eye and it’s just enough to ruin—and it might ruin all of those pots. You might have an entire month’s worth of work just ruined. The glazes—you can mix your glaze slightly wrong and you open up the kiln and it’s all blistered because you put too much calcium in the glaze. And then there are all the aesthetic failures besides the technical failures. It’s just an endless string of failures, and you slowly build up a knowledge base where you can avoid most of the failures, except the accidental ones. You know in the beginning, any young potter, even if they’re not so young, anybody that’s done it for a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n10\\ncouple of years, you know they’ve had miserable experiences, as well as fabulous ones—that’s why they’re still doing it.\\n00:45:33\\nAW: And so you want to support that initiative.\\nRB: Oh, absolutely.\\nAW: Let’s get back to those early art fairs that you were describing. Where were they?\\nRB: They were in Kansas, around Kansas City. Later, I started doing shows all over the country. In the beginning you kind of did local ones, you know. Actually, back then, a lot of shows wouldn’t let crafts in. They were banned. Banned in Boston. Most of the big shows wouldn’t allow it. The guy that I apprenticed with in Kansas City was the first craftsperson of any ilk who was allowed in the Kansas City Plaza Art Fair, which is still a really good art fair. He was the very first non two-dimensional, or sculptor, who was allowed in. He broke that ceramic barrier. They didn’t have weavers, glass blowers, potters, woodworkers—none of those people were allowed. Even photographers weren’t even allowed.\\nAW: Who was that person?\\nRB: James Vandergrift. There were shows in Chicago that had these very rigid rules. Even after they allowed crafts, if they were functional crafts, they wouldn’t allow those. There were a lot of wrestling matches that went on to be able to access the marketplace. You know, there were enough that allowed it that you could struggle and make a living but—so, I was doing art shows, maybe four or five a year, and then after 1978, I was doing fifteen a year, sometimes more. The logistics of that are crazy. In order to not do them all here in the Midwest—because in the Midwest they’re only going to be in the summer—you had to find shows in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Georgia, California, Arizona, New Mexico. The other part of that was I got to see the country, and I really discovered that I liked being a roadie. Now that I’m sixty-seven, almost, I’m a little less fond of doing too much of that. Ten years ago, they were adventures. You went out without any guarantee, you know; you’d pay the jury fee, then the booth fee, then you’d have to get a hotel. By the time that you’d start your engine to go on a trip you might have a thousand dollars already spent with no guarantee that there was any reward at the end of that trip—you could go and it would rain all weekend, people wouldn’t like your work. It was all a guess. I discovered that I liked that. I like not knowing it in the studio and I also like not knowing it in the economics. I find it interesting. Obviously, it worked out on balance that there was enough income to justify it. I know people whose work is so remarkable, so rare, that it’s too expensive or too obscure intellectually that people just don’t pick up on it. I don’t know how that would have affected me if I wasn’t able to evolve an audience for what I did. I’m not sure. I don’t know, maybe get a job and then you do this on the side. I would hate that, but I know a lot of people that did.\\n00:50:02\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n11\\nAW: What were some of the most adventurous trips that you did? Or maybe the first ones you were going across country? Any particular experiences stand out in your memory?\\nRB: I went to Florida in 1985. It was the first time that I went to Florida and I was in the Coconut Grove Art Fair, which was a really big deal at the time. You had to set up the show at four-thirty in the morning, in the dark; you weren’t even sure if you were in the right location. There was nobody there telling you. You just found your number on the street. I’m setting up my show and it’s just getting daylight, so it’s probably seven-thirty, eight o’clock, and I’ve got my back to the street and I started hearing all this commotion, and I turn around and the street was full of people, already. The show wasn’t supposed to start until ten. There were people behind my booth now looking in my boxes because they’re suddenly wanting to buy stuff, and I’m not even remotely set up. So I’m taking money and people are just taking pots out of boxes and saying, “How much is this?” “This is twenty-five dollars, fifty, dollars, whatever,” then handing me money and walking away without even wrapping it. By the end of that day I had four pots on one table left, and I was just out of breath the whole time. It was like I had been attacked by a bunch of crows. It was just amazing. Things like that happen.\\nAW: You were describing that kind of friendly camaraderie in the early art fairs—did that continue?\\nRB: Yeah, but I think now there is a little bit of standoffishness when people think they have a style or something that they don’t want somebody copying. There isn’t much of it, at least not in pottery; there’s very little of it. It got more professional, and in a way that made it less charming. Some of the people that came into it later on I think became more entitled, may be the right word, you know; they’d be grumpy after the first three hours. I learned a long time ago with art fairs and with just being a potter trying to make a living, you kind of base it on a year. There’s going to be three failures in a row and then you’re going to have some success. Over the years, you just wait it out. I rarely have any pots left at the end of the year.\\nAW: So something’s working right.\\nRB: Yeah, something’s working okay. So, if it’s not starting out right, the first day of an art fair, just wait until tomorrow. Even if the thing is a disaster, you go home and your truck is still full of pots. I’m totally confident that those pots are already sold, I just haven’t figured out where yet. It feels like a waste of time when you go out and have a disaster, but it’s not. I don’t know. I’m not real philosophical about it. I don’t get twitchy about it. If a show, the management, if they do a really terrible job—if they don’t advertise, or if they are rude to the artists—I’m not happy about that. But they’re kind of a blast. It’s just I’m getting older and they are more work now, but if I were young I’d do them again.\\nAW: What was so fun about them when you were younger?\\nRB: Well, I like to eat and drink. I’d always have a cooler full of beer at the booth. I’m not saying I was drunk all day—I wasn’t, because you couldn’t be—but you know you’d have a little party all the time. People would come by, the customers you’d party with, and you’d make it social. At night you’d go out with all your friends, you know, restaurant-ing and hanging out at a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n12\\nbar and telling all your day’s stories. What did people say to you? What was the most ridiculous question you were asked today? They were fun. You made a lot of friends. I had a group of friends here and I had a group of friends on the road. It was fun to run into them, and we found great restaurants out on the road—we were really good at it, finding good places to eat. It also helps you learn to cook, you know, ask the chef, “Hey, how did you make that?”\\n00:55:30\\nAW: Would you often do that?\\nRB: Sure, absolutely. Ask the waiter, “Can I talk to the chef?” Then a guy comes out. “This was a fabulous meal. You mind telling me how you did it?” Then he’d go, “The secret is, you know, I use red wine to deglaze the pain and blah, blah blah.“ You just get little tips and techniques and stuff, you know—it was fun. Ann Arbor was a particularly good town because it was a good show, the sale was good, and there were five, six, seven really remarkably good restaurants there that you would look forward to eating at every year. As soon as you got into Ann Arbor it was like, Oh, I think I’ll go to the Earl. I even knew what I was going to order. The only place that you can get sweetbreads. I’ve never seen them on a menu since.\\nAW: You mentioned earlier that you really liked cooking, and you were thinking about opening up a bakery, you have these interests overlapping—maybe the cooking and making stuff with your hands, and the chemistry in creating ceramics and--\\nRB: I think the dot connecting between food and pots is perfect. I like to have parties. I like to go to parties. I like to bring food to parties. I like to have food brought here. There’s all this community around eating. There was a woman—Harriet Cohen—wrote this one sentence that completely defined my view of pots, “Cooking, displaying and sharing food is the last ritual left to modern man. Being a potter sets you right in the middle of that ritual.” I thought, Boy, all the time you struggle to tell people why you make pots and there it is in one sentence.\\nAW: You really emphasize the social aspects that you really like. Do you think that makes you unique, or do you think that potters often are social, or are there a mixture of personalities?\\nRB: I think you can be a completely good potter and be misanthropic. I particularly like people. I like visitors. I like talking to my customers. We have a big fire pit, and we try to have as many fires as possible. Last night we were at a winery up the road here and they were having celebrate spring night for their friends, and we sat around the fire and it was fabulous. There’s something about a little bit of alcohol, a little bit of food, and a fire that just gets people talking to each other. It was funny. There were lots of good political conversations. It was great.\\nAW: Well great. That gets us transition back to how and why you came to Minnesota. You were in Kansas City and looking for a new place. Can you walk us through your decision making to come to Minnesota?\\nRB: When I lived out in Colorado, I was trying to set up a studio and I found an empty three-car garage that this guy owned. I fixed the roof. It was kind of in shabby condition. I insulated it and A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n13\\nfixed it up. He bought the materials and I did all the labor. I set up my studio in there and I was there for a month and then he said, “Oh, you know what? I found somebody to rent this place for more money than you’re willing to.” So he kicked me out. And then that happened again. When I got to Kansas City, I thought, I got to buy a piece of land somewhere. Again, I don’t mean to overemphasize this independence thing, but I thought, You know what? I got to be in a reliable place. I bought 160 acres up by Little Falls and it was big enough that I wouldn’t have to deal with the county, the city, the neighbors, whatever. I didn’t ever want to have to move a pottery studio again, which I’ve actually done two more times since then. They’re horrible to move. You’ve got all of that equipment and it’s heavy. I just wanted to get someplace where I could just lay down roots. I figured I could live anywhere and it wouldn’t matter, I’d make that work. I’ve always believed that I can make friends wherever I go, so coming into a strange community was no big deal. There’s another more negative side to that is that by being an independent potter, you’re not as dependent upon a community because you’re not employed there, you’re not running for office there—all those things—so you can be kind of aloof, as well. Most of the income I’ve made over my life has not been in the community that I’ve lived in. In a way, I always thought that that was kind of liberating but at the same time it didn’t connect me to my community nearly as much as if you belonged to a church or if you owned a business and employed people and that kind of stuff. Those are the two sides of the view. So you form friendships and communities in other ways.\\n01:01:32\\nAW: How did you that when you moved to Little Falls? [Interview break] Resuming again, you were just about to tell us about the food co-op in Little Falls.\\nRB: Little Falls was a really funny town that I knew nobody in, but I went into the food co-op because I like good quality food and a lady that was there said, “Who are you? You’re new in town.” And said, “You know what? We’re having a board meeting tonight. You should come over to our board meeting and get to know everybody.” I went to the board meeting, and I got put on the board that night. They didn’t know anything about me. [Laughs].\\nAW: From “Who are you?” and “What’s your name?” to “Join our board.” [Laughs].\\nRB: Right, so there were just some wonderful people who became lifelong friends. There were a couple of crafts people that I met through that who were also involved in it. There was also a town deli a block from the food co-op that were also members of the co-op. These two women that ran the town deli were ex-nuns. They called me up one time and said, “Would you make us plates and bowls and cups?” I said, “Sure.” When I delivered them, I said, “What I would like to do,”—I wanted to pull a scam here—“I’ll give you all these pots in exchange for you selling my pots here in the delicatessen.” They had shelving on the walls and they said, “Sure.” I gave them all kinds of plates, bowls, cups—whatever they wanted—and then I’d bring them a box of pots and they’d put them up on display and they’d sell them. Whenever I came into town they’d give me an envelope full of cash, or checks and stuff. It kept me alive for two or three years because I wasn’t doing a lot of art fairs then. I was actually just trying to establish studio then. That was another connection into the community was through those two women. They had a lot of people in the circle and then through the food co-op. And then I like taverns; taverns are sort of my A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n14\\nchurch. I like beer and I like hanging out in taverns. So, local taverns near up by where my studio was. I got in a pool league—I like to shoot pool. So, you start meeting people.\\nAW: You said the food co-op folks were friendly. Did you find that people in general were friendly and open to newcomers?\\nRB: Yeah, when I was building the studio there—it was a pretty good-size building. It was seventy-five by thirty. I had built the rafters myself, the tresses, but, you know, are really heavy. My next door neighbor had come by one day to see what the hell was going on, who was building over here. He was being really nosy but he was a really nice guy. He had found out the day that we were going to be hoisting these rafters up and he brought seven guys over, and they helped us lift those rafters into place. As soon as they were nailed into place they all just headed out and that was the end of that. It was really wonderful.\\nAW: Sounds like a barn raising.\\nRB: It was, it was. They didn’t know me. I started helping them in hay fields and run their cattle from their north pasture to their south pasture. There were some dairy farmers around that had some kids that were just a little bit younger than we were, so we’d kind of hang out. It was a good neighborhood.\\n01:05:30\\nAW: You moved here with your first wife?\\nRB: Mm-hmm. We got divorced in 1985, and I moved to Minneapolis. We kept that place until we sold it. I moved to Minneapolis. She met somebody else and got a life going. They’re married still. My current wife, Mary Everett, was living in Minneapolis. She had lived in Little Falls. We knew each other from the food co-op. We were on the board together and found out we were both in Minneapolis and started hanging out. It was a new relationship.\\nAW: How long were you in Minneapolis?\\nRB: Four years.\\nAW: And did you practice pottery there? Did you have a studio there? How was that experience different?\\nRB: Oh, yes. It was remarkably different. I was shocked at how different it as. The city was such a distraction, in good ways and bad ways. You had to really be disciplined in the city to stay at work all day because there was so much going on, you know: restaurants, bars, people everywhere. Just walking down the street was a distraction. I like to work too, you know, but it opened up other things. I got on the board of the Minnesota Craft Council and got involved with that community. That studio was kind of a magnet for a lot of people. It had been around for a while. When I moved in there were three women working there and there was an existing kiln, and I built a kiln in there. That was really a good time for me. I think I experimented a lot more A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n15\\naesthetically, in terms of form and, you know, all of that stuff. There was lots of experimentation going on. It was about the same time that I started doing farther reaching art fairs. I think it helped build some reputation at that time. Little Falls is kind of the edge of the universe. We’d start having sales at the studio with a group of people. It got to be fun. Doing more art fairs around the Twin Cities, building an audience that way. It was shocking: the urban artists were different than the country artists. I mean, there was more competition, there was a little more wariness—not a lot—it wasn’t debilitating by any means, but there was more of it, more competitive. It was all right, I like competition.\\nAW: Did you find the same sense of community there?\\nRB: Yeah, there was. It was more based on the intellectual side rather than the lifestyle side. A fellow named Duke Klassen, who’s a jeweler in Minneapolis, he and I are friends—and we started something called Third Thursdays. We would meet at Knickerbockers’ Bar on the third Thursday of every month. It was no invitation; it was just open to everybody. We would have thirty, forty, fifty people come to that. Sometimes it would only be eight or ten of us. But it got to be a real powerful vehicle for meeting people; it was a lot of fun. We really enjoyed it. Then people started kind of—they didn’t like coming to taverns—so we decided to take it underground, just to get rid of the whining. We didn’t make it invitational but we sort of had a phone tree. But, the third Thursday idea, they do that up in Duluth now, the craftspeople up there—Duluth and along the North Shore. They’ve really made it work. It’s really amazing. They get a hundred people sometimes. It’s all potluck and they do it at somebody’s house each month, the third Thursday of the month. They really made it successful. We had it successful for a while, but because we had a penchant for doing it in taverns, then a lot of people didn’t come. I didn’t want to do it in somebody’s house because then there is formalities, you know, people have to clean and dress up and, What do you bring? What do you don’t bring? When do you leave? When is too early to get there or too late? At a tavern, you just walk in, have a beer, leave, stay all night, whatever. But, it caused the demise of our third Thursday. (Laughs) That was fine, too. We still do it, actually, but we don’t call it Third Thursday; sometimes we have it on Wednesday. We just call a bunch of people up and they call a bunch of people up and we meet. Now we’re meeting at Manning’s Bar and Grill over by Como. Yeah, it’s fun.\\n01:11:30\\nAW: Where in Minneapolis were you living at the time?\\nRB: We lived in “Nordeast” before it was popular. We lived on Quincy between Spring and Summer. We could walk to work. Mary worked at RealiaStar Insurance, which then was Northwestern National Life Insurance Company. She worked there, which was about a block and a half from my studio. Do you know where Origami is? Do you know where that restaurant is? Well, they’re in that building and then there was an alley and then there was our building, which is now the Federal Reserve Bank. On the corner was Berman Buckskin. It was a red brick four-story building, a beautiful building. Mr. Berman owned the alley between the two buildings we were in. I got there at six-thirty in the morning and that’s when he got there. One day the kiln room door was open, and he walked in and wanted to know about what was going on there. I made coffee for him. He would show up pretty much every day for coffee. There were three A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n16\\nNative American guys living in the back parking lot in a Ford Falcon station wagon, and they would come in for coffee every morning. It was just a nice little spot. But he informed me that the city was getting ready to take that block out and we probably had a year. So here I am moving another pottery studio. So that’s when we bought this place. My wife, Mary, said, “I’ll go one hour. I’ll drive one hour to work.” So we drew a circle around Minneapolis and then we would go—we’d spend the night in like, Welch, Minnesota, and then we’d drive in the morning in rush hour traffic. We were just trying to see what would be the best route. We did that in all four quadrants and this quadrant was the easiest. Then we found this place, and we liked it a lot. We built this house. There was nothing here but a horse pasture.\\nAW: Then you have this house here and the studio and then what’s over there?\\nRB: Yeah, when she quit her job she wanted to build a building—she wanted to start a business out here. She wanted to build a building herself. She hired a carpenter and they built that building together. She was going to run a small business—a kind of advisory business, you know, taxes and government regulations and human resource stuff. She would do that for small businesses, but then a non-profit hired her to be their financial manager and so she did that for a while. She never used that building, so it turned into my showroom and a garage—it’s a warehouse. Upstairs is kind of a like bunkhouse when we do the Tour all the helpers—there are like six beds up there.\\nAW: Was there anything else you wanted to add on that? Setting up a studio in an urban place like Northeast, or in a rural area—when you knew you wanted to move a third time did you know that you wanted to go back to somewhere in the country? What was the experience like setting up your studio in Minneapolis?\\n01:15:20\\nRB: It was easy. There was already an approved gas meter and a gas line. There was a big gas line for the kiln that was there. It had been approved like twenty years before. It was kind of a neighborhood nobody was paying attention to. You could kind of do whatever you wanted. Building a kiln in an urban—back then was really difficult because you were sort of lumped in with nuclear power plants in terms of risk factors. It was really hard to get permission. So that was nice because there was an existing, approved gas meter. It’s very difficult. That’s why people end up spending a lot of time at Northern Clay Center and Fired Up and those places because they can’t have access to gas kilns except for those places. There are exceptions. But out here, it’s nothing. Nobody cares, other than the insurance company. But the county, you know, they’re interested in how you build your building. They don’t care what you put in it, unless it was some kind of hazardous chemicals. So this was an attempt at one final—although, now we’re going to sell.\\nAW: Oh really?\\nRB: Yeah.\\nAW: Are you going to build a new studio again? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n17\\nRB: I don’t know. I mean, it’s really a problem. We’re going to move to the city again. I’m going to find some kind of studio. I don’t know how we’re going to do that, but--\\nAW: --Wow, that seems like a big change. So, you moved in here when?\\nRB: Eighty-eight.\\nAW: So from ’88 to now, that’s quite a long time you’ve been here.\\nRB: Twenty-six years. So my agreement with my wife is that we will host the pottery tour until the twenty-fifth anniversary. So we think we have a young potter to buy the house in two years. That’s faster than we had planned, but it also fits our timeline better. They’ll become the host of the Tour when they take over and I’ll just be the guest. That’ll be great.\\nAW: Must be tough to leave here.\\nRB: Extremely, but she did this for me. Now I’m doing the reverse. She didn’t want to live here. She did it for my benefit. She will have done it for twenty-eight years; that’s a lot.\\nAW: You have built a wonderful building over there with the bunkhouse—you can come and be there. You’ll never be just a guest, I have a feeling. This will always be your home.\\nRB: Yeah, she’s liked it out here. We’ve made friends out here and she likes them, but she wants to get closer to libraries, and bookstores, and universities. I like the urban scene, too. I’ve probably spent most of my life in the country, but I like cities. I have no problem with it—other than there’s a lot of beauty here.\\nAW: There is. This is a really beautiful piece of land you have here.\\nRB: Yeah, but we’ll make it work. I’m happy to do it. In fact, it will be another adventure.\\nAW: That’s a really good attitude to have towards it.\\nRB: Yeah, I just want to keep making pots. I’ve got to find a studio. And I’ll find that.\\nAW: While you’ve been here have you maintained connections with Twin Cities' potters? Has that been relatively easy to do? Or challenging at times?\\nRB: Yeah, for the first few years we lived out here we were probably in Minneapolis entirely for our social—maybe for ten years we were going in there once a week, maybe, sometimes more. We go to a lot of theater and music—\\nAW: —Oh, I know what I was going to ask. What were the taverns that you were going to for third Thursdays?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n18\\n01:20:00\\nRB: There was one across from the old Metrodome. It was called Knickerbockers’ and it changed two or three times. I don’t know what it is now. We tried Gluek’s downtown; we did that for a while. Where else? We’ve had it at about five different places. We had it at the Sample Room one time; that wasn’t a good idea. I mean, the Sample Room was great, I liked everything about that place, it just wasn’t good for a group of twenty people who were just going to be there hanging out. You need a somewhat neighborhood tavern kind of place.\\nAW: Ok. I didn’t mean to interrupt. You were saying about staying connected there?\\nRB: Most of our friends are in the Twin Cities still, yeah, craftspeople.\\nAW: Your wife—did she also do some crafts?\\nRB: No, no. I think she thinks that there is a virus in clay, and if you get too close to it too often, then you quit everything else in your life and you just start doing pottery. She doesn’t want to do that. She’s seen the obsession.\\nAW: That’s pretty amazing about your relationship that she supported that obsession even as you have supported her.\\nRB: Yeah, and I think even enjoyed it.\\nAW: Sometimes it can be hard in a relationship if someone is---there’s time there where you’re setting up your studio, building an audience, getting regular support for your art—and if a partner is not in the arts scene, is in a different field—I was wondering if you had any reflections on that?\\nRB: I don’t know if we have good balance or not—I think it’s probably been mostly weighted in my favor—but we spend a lot of time together. We both like theater and we like music and so we find lots to do together. She’s an avid book reader, and I will be, when I get back.\\nAW: Tierney is, too, which is why I looked at Tierney.\\nTM: Yeah, there’s a reason I’m a history major.\\nRB: My wife just recently quit her job, so she’s now full-time reading. She was always a full-time reader. If she’s not in the kitchen, she’s reading books.\\nAW: So, you each have an obsession?\\nRB: I know; it came to a head one time about something. She was suggesting that I stop doing something and I said, “Well, then would a fair trade be that you stop reading books?” (Laughs).\\nAW: I bet she said, “No.” (Laughs). A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n19\\nRB: I like to play poker and so I think she was wondering if I shouldn’t play poker so much. I don’t play as much as I used to.\\nTM: Yeah, I see the giant stack of books just sitting right there.\\nRB: Oh, you should see upstairs. I bet she’s read four books in the last three days. Some good, some bad, some trash. I used to be a more avid reader but not anymore. I don’t know why—too busy, too tired.\\nAW: When you were in Minneapolis in the eighties you were experimenting a lot with different styles. Can you tell us more about what you were experimenting with?\\nRB: Right about then I was on the board of the Minnesota Craft Council. I was the Vice President and the Vice President’s job was to put on the annual meeting. We decided to have the annual meeting in Duluth one year, and it was my job to get all the speakers and organize the whole thing. Nobody would help me, so I thought, Ok, what do I want to hear? I thought one of the things that always plagues craftspeople is that they tend to work alone. So I organized three speakers to address the idea of how do you stay motivated working alone? It was great. We had Walter Nottingham, was the main guy. He spoke on making fewer choices—having fewer things you bring into your artistic life to make decisions about. He had this wonderful slide show of fifteen artists that had gone to school with him—fiber artists; he was a fiber professor. He had followed their careers after they had left his tutelage. They had all chosen something early on to focus on, you know, really narrow. He showed them their slides, their progression as artists, having chosen narrowly, how it expanded their creative horizons, and he said, “Listen, when you’re in your studio and you’re doing something you like to do and you feel good about yourself when you’re doing it, then just do that a lot. It’s not complicated.” I went home from that meeting, and two other people in the studio where I worked were there at the meeting, as well. We all had completely different opinions about what he meant by narrowing your choices. He kept saying, “Listen, the thing you need to do is do it for yourself.” It took me about three months, but I sorted out that what I did for myself was ash glazes. Whenever I had a pot that I really liked in a certain way, I would put ash glazes on it. Couldn’t sell them. They were just your favorite pots and—the ash glaze was impossible to sell. Thinking about it, I thought, If I’m going to do it for myself, then I need to make the kind of pots that will work with the ash glazes because that’s what I really liked. So, I did. I quit doing everything else and I started experimenting with form and stuff that would work with these ash glazes that I had invented. I got destroyed, financially; I mean, I couldn’t give them away. For two years I was just going into debt. I would go off to art fairs and I’d think I had these beautiful pots, and nobody would buy them. Then, I got a handle on the aesthetic and—it was like in the beginning when you were smitten with pottery and now I’m smitten with this idea. I know it’s a really good idea, it’s the right direction, and then it started to work. Then it really took off. I could really explore. So, long explanation.\\n01:27:56\\nAW: Can you tell us more about the ash glaze and why you used them? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n20\\nRB: The ash glazes are a couple thousand years old. The Chinese Han Dynasty used them. They kind of fell into disfavor. They’re kind of runny. They can ruin a lot of your pots because they just run; if you don’t handle it right, they ruin the kiln shelves. There are a lot of reasons people quit using them. But it’s just natural wood ash from a fireplace. I kind of like that and that you can mix simple ingredients with them and you can make these really wonderful materials. I figured out a way to make them so they weren’t quite so runny, and they were actually matte surfaces more than bright shiny surfaces, which I didn’t like. Then I discovered the application of slips, so I invented a slip that I could put on bisque ware—which is a really backwards way of doing it—and it worked great with the ash glazes. Suddenly I was able to explore surface texture, surface color, surface of contrasts. They started to integrate with the pots better. The pot forms that I like to make and the surfaces that I put on them now made sense together. I would probably be arrogant to say this, but I probably single-handedly re-started ash glazes, you know; people just had quit doing them. They hadn’t been done for decades. I would find other people doing them now and then when I was out and about. Then, ten years later, I was at a show in Kansas City and there were nine people doing ash glazes there at that show. And I thought, Wow, this has really changed, you know, because there was nobody. It was really funny how quickly it changes.\\n01:30:08\\nAW: Why do you think ash glaze became more popular?\\nRB: I think people see them and see that they like them. They hadn’t seen them before. They’ve heard about them, but they don’t know about them; they’ve never tried them. So they see them and they like it, so they want to explore that. Other people see somebody having some success with something and they angle in that direction. Porcelain came about early 1980s—boy, just herds of people ran to porcelain. It was trendy, and some people did it well, some people didn’t do it well. The ones that weren’t doing it well they were just doing it because it was a trend. The ones that did it well, they made something fabulous out of it. I think the same thing happened with Raku. Whenever there’s any of these changes that happens, whenever there’s any new innovation, there’s a huge movement towards it. And then the residue is five or ten percent become masterful at it, and everybody else are just kind of charlatans and then they drop out or move on to something else. If you do this long enough you can see these circles that happen, cycles of trends that come and go.\\nAW: How would you describe the work that you were doing when you first started? What style were you working in or how would you define that?\\nRB: I think it was related to the first guy I apprenticed with—early American, heavy, chunky stoneware. I don’t think they were pure early American, nor were they pure mimics of this guy, but they had that feel—heavy duty, thick rims, thick handles—just utilitarian pots. That evolved over time. Actually, I think my first wife, I think we were driven more by her aesthetic, for years. I don’t think I had a real good concept of what I wanted to do. I just wanted to make pots, and make beautiful pots. She had a pretty distinct idea of what she wanted to do. I think we both followed down her aesthetic path. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n21\\nAW: How would you define that?\\nRB: It was really earthy glazes, really simple pot forms, pretty straightforward. She was really influenced by—I wouldn’t say Scandinavian modern, but that kind of contemporary modern design in the Sixties, real clean. There wasn’t a lot of elaboration. We were using glazes that were fairly common in the day, limestone matte glazes. They’re beautiful. They’re still my favorite glazes. They’re just lush, smooth; they feel good to the touch. They’re a little bit like latex wall paint except with more warmth to it. It was just simple, nice stuff, which I like, simple.\\nAW: How did things change after you were experimenting with ash glaze? Was that the next big change?\\nRB: That was the key change and the use of ash and slip together. I decided that what I didn’t want to do was make perfect pots. I had no desire to make refined work. I wanted to make pretty crude, coarse, but controlled. I started making more explorations into loosening up the form range and how I would let the forms just evolve organically and not try to push it in any kind of perfection. I think I’ve slid a little bit back towards being more skillful but not completely, not every part of it. As much as I value skill and craftsmanship, it can be a trap, too. It can be a trap of feeling that that’s enough, and that’s not enough. I call it vacuous virtuosity, when you can be really good at something but there’s no voice in it.\\n01:35:20\\nAW: How would you define your style? The kind of pottery you make today?\\nRB: I’ve always tried to find the right word. I would like them to be moving towards primitive, but I feel like I don’t quite pull the trigger on that. I take it part of the way there. It’s halfway to primitive. It’s loose, it’s organic, but it still pulls in those things that I did when I first started: chunky rims and fat handles, weighty.\\nAW: Why do you make what you make?\\nRB: I make it because it’s useful. I’m a part of that process I talked about—the ritual. The funny compliments that you get and one of them is when somebody says, “You know, your soup bowls that we own, they’re either on the table or in the dishware,” which tells you that they use them everyday. That’s really pleasant: to make something that people choose as their favorite thing that they have to have their food in. A guy once told me, “You know, when we got divorced, the only argument we had were about your pots,” and it was because they had used them everyday. He was back buying some pots because he lost the argument. One of the best treats you ever have to is to go into a stranger’s house—you’re invited to a party or something—and there are your pots on the table. They don’t even know you made them. That’s really cool: that you’re anonymous and you’re at this event and this person that you don’t know found your work somewhere and they’re using it, and they thought enough of it that they put it out on this table for their community, their friends.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n22\\nAW: Has that happened to you?\\nRB: Yeah, a few times.\\nAW: Did you talk to the person?\\nRB: No, I wanted to leave that undone because it changes the relationship. Later you can talk about it but--\\nAW: --Well, that would be really amazing to show up and see that.\\nRB: It is. So that’s why you make them. One of the potters on the Tour, Will Swanson, he said something really profound a few years ago. I like these one-sentence explanations. We were talking about notoriety and the importance of it or non-importance of it. He said, “All I know is that I want to be notable in the cupboard,” meaning that you’re the person when they open the door that they sort through all the coffee cups to get to yours. I thought that was meaningful. That says what you’re about.\\nAW: Well, thank you. I think that helps clarify more about the style and type of pottery that you’re making and why you make it.\\nRB: When you’re making something you sit down with some food in mind—How would this be used?—if you’re making a new object. What am I making this for? How will this enter the world as opposed to being put behind glass in a cupboard. Is it too big? Is it too little? Could it hold a salad and salad for how many? Would this be a good Thanksgiving mashed potato bowl? You think about all that stuff when you’re making it.\\n01:40:03\\nAW: And then how great to show up to someone’s party and see it being used in that way. Have there ever been times that you’ve shown up and stuff has been used in an unusual way or you’ve seen it behind glass?\\nRB: Oh sure, always, I mean that happens too much, but it’s fine. People have to store it somewhere. As long as it’s not precious.\\nAW: Is that approach to pottery something common nowadays for a lot of potters or is that an unusual approach?\\nRB: I think it’s actually more prevalent in Minnesota. I think there is a little more of that ethic of things being accessible and useful, and part of it is price. I mean, if things are too expensive, they become precious. That’s kind of the legacy of Warren MacKenzie, a little bit. I wouldn’t put it all on him because I think I had that philosophy, as well, and I think others do, but he defined it as a Minnesota cultural thing. There are other places where that’s true, too, but here a lot more people are practicing making pots to be used, in all its real meaning. It’s not that it’s just a useful A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n23\\npot, which is now a prized possession put away for investment or admiring. I think the people here, both the audience and the makers, are using their pots.\\nAW: Why do you think that developed here or in St. Croix River Valley community?\\nRB: I think because of Warren MacKenzie. He defined that culture decades ago, you know: of being accessible and having things stay out of the glass cabinet.\\nAW: But you said you were practicing that before you came to Minnesota?\\nRB: Mm hmm. And the guy I apprenticed with was of that ilk. My second apprenticeship, they were the opposite. They were more, These are art objects and they’re precious and they’re expensive.\\nAW: Where else in the country today do you also see this approach to pottery as useful pottery?\\nRB: It’s here and there, potter by potter, as opposed to region. I think there are some in North Carolina, but there’s such a big pottery community there that it has to surface. It’s actually sneered at a lot: that Minnesota is holding down the ceramic economic values. I dispute that but--\\nAW: --Where is that argument coming from?\\nRB: People that just have been trained differently. I just had that argument a week ago in Washington, D.C., with a young potter—made beautiful work—but she’s not making functional pots. She thought that cheap functional pots were really suppressing the market. That’s just not true; it’s not even remotely true, at any level. She just thought, “Well, you know that not putting proper prices on it just devalues it.” I go, “Sorry, I disagree. People who are going to buy your work, the way you project it, are not the people who are going to buy my work. I’m not affecting the people that buy your work. They’re two different universes.” They can exist at the same time, that’s what I think people don’t believe. I just think everybody develops their own audiences. Sometimes you have to go farther away to find them.\\nAW: So, finding your audience here, let’s get back to that. When you first arrived in Little Falls, were there many potters here? Was there a sense of a pottery community?\\nRB: I can almost name them—there was Warren MacKenzie, Wayne Branum, Mark Pharis, Janel Jacobson, Linda Christianson. Jeff Oestreich, John Coiner, Peter (??) that was about it. Oh, there was Peter Leach. These were people that were doing it for a serious level; they weren’t working another job and doing it, this was their career. I remember early on, the first couple of events I went to in Minnesota, people just, “What are these?” They didn’t fit in any of the categories that existed around here in the culture that had already been very established. It was really hard. I had to develop my own audience.\\n01:45:52\\nAW: How do you that? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n24\\nRB: You just keep banging away at it. You talk to people that like the work. You get their name and address and you invite them to the next event. They bring a friend, and ten people become two hundred people become four hundred and suddenly it’s a thousand. You do enough events in a region, and, if you pay attention, it may take five years but—you do things like have them in the delicatessen. I don’t think it’s that complicated, but it’s a lot of diligence. And it’s none of the things that you really want to spend your time on. You just want to make this stuff. A potter I know, we were talking about what would be your favorite way to market your work. And I said, “I’m doing it. I like what I’m doing and I think this is great.” And I said, “How about you?” And she said, “Well, I would just like to make the work, fire it, unload the kiln and put it out in the yard, and have someone come and write me a check and take it all away.” I think that’s fine ,but that’s a person that doesn’t like people and doesn’t want to engage in a lot of different personalities. Wants to have fewer people in their lives. That’s fine, but I want to have lots of people.\\nAW: So, you enjoy that part of it—both making it and selling it to someone.\\nRB: I’ve never thought of myself as the village potter where you’re making pots for a specific community. A lot of people try to envision that for themselves. I never have. I didn’t mind the road, taking off for a strange art fair somewhere. I just think it’s really cool—you get to a new community that you’ve never been at, you set your work up and people walk down the street and somebody angles over because it kind of looks like something they might be interested in, and you see them smile, they like it, and then they start talking to you about it and they go, “You know what? I’ve never seen you before, I’ve never seen any work like this before, but I have to have that.” You sell it to them and you get their name and address, and the next time you’re going to be in Phoenix or wherever you send them a card and say, “I’m going to be at blah, blah, blah.” You develop audiences all over the place, which we’ll get to later, but that’s part of why people are coming to the Tour from far, far away is because all of that stuff that people have done in the past, you know: nurturing audiences in other places. I think that’s one of the secrets we’ve uncovered is that people will travel. They like road trips just like I like road trips. They’re passionate collectors and so, “You know, I’ve always wanted to o to Minneapolis,” so they come here for the Tour and get a weekend in Minneapolis and go to some theater or go to the museum.\\nAW: So, people really make it a vacation destination here? Where are they coming from?\\nRB: Everywhere. You’d be shocked.\\nAW: List off some of the countries or states?\\nRB: We had a guy fly in from London; we’ve had a guy from Malaysia; Canada, of course; then Miami, Los Angeles. A couple drove here from Bellingham, Washington, bought a bunch of pots, turned around and drove home. Regularly, I bet you we have a 100 or more people come from Chicago, Milwaukee. They’re coming from Philadelphia and New York. It’s really crazy. It’s wonderful. They appear to be having a good time, too, so I think we’re doing a good job.\\n01:50:32 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n25\\nAW: Why do you think so many people come from so many places?\\nRB: It’s really good pots. I think it’s at first a qualitative issue, and then we have quantities of pots. It’s one of those things that’s so rare—anytime anybody goes to see your work in a gallery or even in an art fair, they’re only looking at ten or twenty pieces. Where here, everybody is showing two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred pieces. They get a complete view of your ceramic work, and I think that’s been really important. Probably in two weeks there will be four thousand pots back here.\\nAW: Wow, that’s amazing, I’m really looking forward to seeing them.\\nRB: There might only be three thousand of them on display because you just can’t fit them. On the Tour, I’m sure there will be ten thousand pots. There’s no other place you can do that. There’s no other experience like that. I mean, there are little experiences like that, other people that are doing tours and studio sales, but the experience that people have had in the past has always been a limited view of your work. Now, they get this expansive view of your work. They’re a little overwhelmed when they first see it because it’s so much to look at and then they get into it, and it’s fun. We did a zip code study the last two years of where people came from. Two years ago, it was eighteen percent came more than three hundred miles. This year, twenty-three percent came more than three hundred miles. Pretty shocking, yeah.\\nAW: What were some of the other things you learned from that study? How about 150-300 mile range? How much of a percentage were the visitors from over one hundred miles?\\nRB: It’s almost entirely from Minnesota and a little bit western Wisconsin. It’s like eighty percent from Minnesota. But then, the other twenty percent is made up from the entire country.\\nAW: Before we get so into those details—you said when you arrived there were a lot of potters in the area. Was there a community, strong relationships between potters here in this area?\\nRB: Yeah, the ones who knew each other, there was, but I didn’t know them.\\nAW: Did you meet them when you moved into Little Falls or after you came back from Minneapolis?\\nRB: I started to in art fairs. I don’t think there were any potters up in Little Falls at that time. There were two clay artists that lived in Browerville. I played volleyball with him—Dan and Lee Ross. Do you know them? They’re sculptors, you know, they’re really good. They’re like hidden Minnesota gems. They live up on the North Shore now, but they used to live in Browerville; now they live up in Hovland. They’re really good. They do stone and clay sculpture. They’re really remarkable artists. There are so many little hidden—this state is just like—I don’t know if you’ve ever seen Alice Strand? She does little sewn animals. They get dismissed because everybody thinks they’re just cute, but they’re really wonderful sculptures. She has a thing called Alice’s Animals; they’re just crazy. We have a huge collection of her stuff. There are all these little pockets of people around the state that are remarkable craftspeople that I got to know over A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n26\\nthe years. Because they don’t bang the drum, you know, they’re just working craftspeople. They just work and make a living from it. They don’t sending up any “look at me” flairs. They pay attention to business, they pay attention to their customers and stuff, but they’re just remarkably good artists.\\n01:55:26\\nAW: So, you said in Little Falls, there weren’t many potters. When you went to Minneapolis did you meet more? Then, when you moved to Harris?\\nRB: There was an existing bunch here. Janel Jacobson was maybe the first. Then Linda Christianson and Jeff Oestreich were here. When I bought this place I specifically bought it on this side of I-35 because I didn’t want to get in their way, you know, because they had been here for a while. I just thought, I wanted to be a good neighbor and not move in down the road. But. I knew them. I knew Janel and her husband Will Swanson, probably about as well as anybody. Connee Mayeron lived here, but I didn’t know Connee. I knew Connee from a couple of art fairs but I didn’t know that she lived up in this area. All these people, the potters, have all lived here a while and they have all developed their friendships and circles. We don’t socialize deeply, you know; we just put on the event together. I’m friends with Will and Janel, and Guillermo Cuellar, and Connee Mayeron—Connee and I play poker together. She’s a poker nut. Me too.\\nAW: What led to the development of the Tour?\\nRB: Will Swanson and I used to have breakfast a couple times a month. We’d just talk about this and that, you know, pottery stuff. I said, “We should have an event here.” Will agreed. We were trying to define what that would be. We didn’t want to start another art fair—that model is not worn out, but it’s overused. So then, Why don’t we have a studio event that has a theme that is Minnesota Highway 95. Let’s contact everybody on Highway 95 or within a few miles of that and we’ll get a meeting and see if they want to figure out some kind of event. We went from Prescott to St. Could. It was obvious that there was a cluster right in this area. There were people at either end that didn’t want to come or decided it was too far. I was glad because it would have been too much of a stretch. We got together somewhere—I don’t remember where—and we had a meeting. There wasn’t really a lot of enthusiasm for it because everybody was established, and they all had studio sales that they had been doing for years and so why interrupt that? I just tried to be eloquent and said, “Well look, if we think about the Twin Cities area, if we’re being very liberal, there’s probably five thousand people of these three million who care at all about ceramics. I think that’s a shame. I think we should try to make that fifty thousand. The way we can do that is if we get momentum as a group. We could have an event.“ Everybody was mmm-mm. “When would we do it?” We started in October the first year, or maybe the first two years. I had a fall sale here in the first weekend of October, so we put it on that weekend. Warren MacKenzie was still having his fall sale two weeks later, and a couple of people on the Tour were in his sale. He was on our tour, too. They just thought it was too much to do it two or three weeks apart. After two years, we moved it to the spring, which I thought was a bad idea at the time but I was willing to do it because I knew the reason. But it turned out it just was a bonus because it became successful in the spring. It would have been in the fall but now I could have two sales, one in the fall and one in the spring. My fall sale, this is it’s twenty-fifth year. We A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n27\\nstarted it on Mother’s Day weekend. I don’t even know why we picked that, it just sounded good. It was ok. We did all right. Some people came, but it was nothing overwhelming and nobody was that thrilled about it. But we hung together. That was the biggest challenge, actually, was keeping all the people on board. There was not dissension, but there was just ho-hum. Then there were some wrestling matches about do we do it two days or one day. I refused to do it one day, I said, “I don’t like treating people that way. I don’t want making people have to make all their decisions in one day.” Plus, if you’re having a tour, then it’s too hard. We fought that battle over the years and kept it at two days and then we added a third, maybe twelve years in.\\n02:01:37\\nAW: Why did you add the third?\\nRB: Well, this goes back to my economics training. I think part of how you analyze how to build an audience is look at the culture you’re in and what people are doing—you certainly want to avoid fishing opener, or hunting opener, there are just things culturally that are here and are kind of in your way, maybe, opening day of the Twins. This is lake country, lake cabins, boating and fishing, anytime you look out on Friday, out on I-35 it’s just packed with people heading up to the lake. Will and I argued for almost ten years to open up on Friday because we felt that a significant part of our population, already customers of ours, audience members, they’re heading up in the spring to their cabin on the North Shore or wherever, and their coming back on Sunday and its done. Finally everyone agreed to do it on Friday and literally the show went up forty percent. That was its twelfth year. How does anything grow forty percent twelve years in? It’s little things like that of observing the community you live in and figuring out what the habits are.\\nAW: Did you have a lot of banners and advertising? How did you get those folks off of I-35?\\nRB: Just from our mailing list, that weren’t coming because they were already out of town.\\nAW: This way they could stop on their way out of town.\\nRB: There was another little thing that was undiscovered. The first year, people would come up to me and say, “Oh, I’m so glad that you did this. I can take a personal day off on Friday, come on the Tour and then I have my weekend free.” So, it had that unintended consequence. It was little things like that. Another crazy thing, the first nine years we had a sepia tone little three-fold piece of paper. It was not real interesting but it served its purpose, it got the information out. On the tenth year we talked about what could we do special for the tenth anniversary and we came up with the idea of having a poster, a big poster in color, which was new. The tenth year it doubled from the ninth year, just because of a silly color poster.\\nAW: The power of advertising.\\nRB: I know, but the information hadn’t changed, it came in a different package. That just made my jaw drop. Wow, is it that simple? Maybe it is.\\n02:05:10 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n28\\nAW: What were the numbers like in the early years, before the color poster? Just a ballpark of how many people would come through on the Tour?\\nRB: I’m guessing a thousand and maybe it doubled to two thousand.\\nAW: And then even doubled more when adding the Friday?\\nRB: Friday, I would say it went from one thousand to two thousand and then it went to three thousand when we opened on Friday.\\nAW: Now, what is it like now?\\nRB: Five thousand, and a full seven, eight hundred of them came from beyond three hundred miles.\\nAW: Are the people who are coming from more than three hundred miles, are they return visitors?\\nRB: A lot of them are but a lot of them, they’ve wanted to do it and they maybe come once every three years. Some come every year.\\nAW: Do you still go to art fairs and do you see them there?\\nRB: Yeah, that’s where they found out about it, mostly. I think there’s a word of mouth that’s happening now. It’s gotten enough scale that people talk about it. We send out posters to art centers and they get posted in there and people are taking ceramics classes, you know, they get two or three of their ceramics buddies and they jump in a car and drive out here. We’ll have seven or eight tents, you know, people pitch tents out here. They come in, they don’t want to get a hotel. Now the hotels are filling up because of the Tour, though I think a lot of our out of town people stay in Minneapolis and come out because they’re doing a lot of other things. They’re using the Tour as an excuse to do other things in Minneapolis as well.\\nAW: In those first couple of years who were the people who attended the Tour?\\nRB: Local Minneapolis pot lovers.\\nAW: When did you start to notice that people from out of state and all over the country would come?\\nRB: Maybe ten or twelve years. We were not even sending out invitations to people outside of the area.\\nAW: When did that start? You invite artists to show?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n29\\nRB: I think we started having guests after about the fourth or fifth year. It was supposed to be one guest per place, but some people would have five. We’re really run extremely loosely. We meet once a year. We don’t have organized meetings. We don’t have a board. We meet a week after the Tour, and we assign the jobs that are going to be important next year and somebody says, “Yeah, I’ll do that.” Or I’ll say, “If you want me to, I’ll keep doing the poster, or, blah, blah, blah.” The jobs stay the same or somebody says, “I’m tired of it and will somebody else take it over?” So we’ve settled into a pattern. We have a marketing committee—it’s three of us—which is really just a joke. We just meet at a bar to drink a beer, to socialize; I mean, we do talk about the Tour and we get some things solved, like how much money we’re going to budget for Minnesota Public Radio ads, and once we decide that, we have a beer. It’s really a loosely run thing. We have very few rules. Our only rule is that we’ve finally settled on that eight is the maximum number of guests you can have. The guests have to be here and that they have to be making something in ceramics. That’s our rule. We don’t jury; you choose who you want to have, and we like that better than having some central deciding thing. Hard feelings if there’s somebody you’re proposing and the rest of the group says no. Nobody is going to invite someone they don’t have high views of their work. We just assume that we’re going to be the highest quality of work, people who are serious about it, and we don’t get in anybody’s way. What I do here can be whatever I want to do here. We have a pool of money that we put together that we require each person to contribute equally to and then that’s what we use for marketing, for publishing the poster and the mailing and the website. There’s a poster designer person that works with whoever is making the poster so we get the right stuff for the printing.\\n02:11:06\\nAW: What are the other jobs?\\nRB: There’s a treasurer who everybody pays the money to and they pay the bills. We have one person we call the Bulldog, and their job is to just pester, in a good way, anybody that’s not getting their job done. If we have a deadline for the money coming in and somebody didn’t get it in then the bulldog calls the host of that person, that guest, and tells them, “You need to call so and so and tell them that they didn’t get their money in.” That’s a good job, I mean, that really helps. We have somebody who just deals with the poster. That person also deals with the press releases, but it doesn’t have to be them, they just happen to want to do both jobs. My job is to deal with public radio and any of those kinds of things that come up.\\nAW: Any of the media?\\nRB: Mm-hmm, and then I make suggestions on other media things that I think we should do, to the marketing committee, and then they decide if they want to present it to the group. If we need to we’ll have a meeting online. There are two people who send out the notice letter to all the participants on what the deadlines are. They write that letter and introduction that tells all the guests, This date you’re supposed to have your slides in, your images and This date, half of the money deposited by November 1st because that’s what we use to buy the advertising—the first wave of it.\\nTM: Like a down payment? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n30\\nRB: Yeah.\\nAW: So the guests, they’re selected individually by each artist and then guests will send in money to be part of [the Tour], as each of you are.\\nRB: We all pay equally.\\nAW: Oh you do, so both you and guests.\\nRB: Mm-hmm. Everybody’s location has different costs: some people rent tents, some people don’t, some have port-a-toilets and some don’t, some have food that they charge the guests a part of and other people don’t charge. I bought two golf carts; people helped me pay for those. I hire two traffic ladies—my neighbor over here she hires somebody and they run the traffic and tell people where to park all weekend.\\nAW: Where do they park?\\nRB: We drive all our cars to the front, all of the potters’ cars, right up where you turn in the driveway, in that field. It gets mowed.\\nAW: And for visitors?\\nRB: They park alongside the road and then we have golf carts that will give them rides if they want or they can walk.\\nAW: How does that work if each person has different costs at their studio?\\nRB: The guests at that studio pay those costs separate from the group. That’s up to the host to decide how they distribute those costs: some people do it based on percentage of sales, some people do it equally, some people—the host doesn’t pay anything and the guests divide those costs up. Everybody has a different way of doing it.\\n02:15:22\\nAW: How do you do it?\\nRB: We divide it equally. I’ve never asked the guests to help me pay for the food. That was always our expense, although this year we’re changing to—we’re going to have three food trucks here so instead of us producing—we couldn’t do it anymore.\\nAW: What did you used to do?\\nRB: Right here on this table, we would expand it and we fed everybody. Try to feed four thousand people and it’s--\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n31\\nAW: What would you make? How would you go about doing it?\\nRB: We’d make salads, spreads, dips, spreads, chips, salsas. It varied every year.\\nAW: And the visitors could come just in here and just have a snack?\\nRB: Yeah, and use the bathrooms.\\nAW: That’s amazing to open up your house to all these people.\\nRB: Yeah, but it’s nice.\\nAW: You were explaining how it works here at your studio: you split things up, you were talking about the food and everyone coming through—did you always offer food? When did you start doing that?\\nRB: Always. Right from day one. In the beginning it was the fact that there were no restaurants here and we knew people were coming up from the Twin Cities and we didn’t have anything to recommend them. We like to cook so we started to making the food. Then it became a really big deal and we really started experimenting with the food. The last three years it’s almost impossible for us to keep up, so we decided to cut it and go to food trucks.\\nAW: What are the food trucks you’re expecting this year?\\nRB: We’re going to have a BBQ [truck] from Cambridge, an Asian food truck from Rush City, and a portable wood fire pizza oven. We’re going to have cookies and brownies and coffee and tea and I’ll have beer. We go through a lot of beer.\\nAW: I can imagine. Do you make your own beer?\\nRB: No, but I have friends that do. Friday night we have a party. Other things we do on the Tour is on Thursday night we have a catered dinner at Connee Mayeron’s house that’s an Indian restaurant over in St. Croix Falls, brings us fabulous food. Everybody—the potters and their spouses and whoever they brought for helpers—they would come to that dinner and it’s just kind of a big social. On Friday night we have a party here: people bring musical instruments and we sit around the fire and break out a bunch of different kind of food than we would have had during the day, and people bring their hooch and we have a lot of wine.\\nAW: Has that been an important part of your approach to this [tour]—having food and wine?\\nRB: My approach, but not everybody’s. In fact, I think a lot of people don’t like the idea that there’s alcohol and food and stuff, but they’ve kind of warmed up to it. It’s our personality, you know, my wife and I both. We like nice groups of people and hanging out around food. And get as much of it locally as you can—local cheese, local bread, local whatever. We buy a lot of stuff from our food co-op in Cambridge. We try to have all the beer be local craft beers if we can. If someone puts in a request for something that’s a little harder to call local, I’ll do that to, but still A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n32\\nit has to be handmade. I try to make the whole weekend a celebration of handmade—the food, cheese, breads, just everything, get it as close to not factory as possible.\\n02:20:10\\nAW: Do people from around the area who make breads, make cheese—do you invite them to have their stuff here too?\\nRB: No, this will be new this year with food for sale. We’ve never allowed anything to be for sale other than the pots. I’m sure we’re going to have some discussions about it because I told everybody last year that I was doing this—having food trucks—and actually a couple of other ones are having food trucks. We’ll see how—I think there’s going to be some push and pull of, What does this mean for the Tour? We’ve never done it before, so there will be some conversation about how do we handle it. Hopefully, everybody has a good experience and nobody sees it as a kind of competition, or a negative. We’re a really interesting group: we come at pots and money and sales and all those things—we have much different philosophies about it. We get along about it; we’ve been able to solve all our differences: some people don’t like taking credit cards, and other people do. We don’t enforce that on anybody. Here we have a central checkout that all the guests’ work is sold through one place. Other places, each potter is selling their own work. It’s a different approach. I don’t want people to have to get their wallet out more than once. That’s why we do it that way. You run the risk of making mistakes but we have a pretty good system, and then we have back-ups to back-ups so nobody gets hooked. I’m responsible if it’s negative.\\nAW: Have you kept this system the same way or did you change things over time?\\nRB: That’s always been that way. As soon as I started having guests we’ve had a central cashier. Other people—some have come to it, and some haven’t. It works. I just think it’s remarkable that seven really distinctive personalities we get along, we put it on, and we don’t have to work very hard at it.\\nAW: Yeah, one big planning meeting each year, that’s amazing.\\nRB: --Yeah, somebody interviewed me for the radio once and they said, “Really? You only have one meeting?” And I said, “Yeah.” And they said, “You can get it all done?” And I said, “Yeah.” And they just wouldn’t let it go, and they said, “Well, why do you just have one meeting?” And I said, “That’s all we need.” And they said, “That’s crazy.” And I said, “Well, maybe”—and I was just being facetious—“Maybe, if you have too many meetings you find out that you don’t like each other. Maybe, if you have one meeting you don’t build up any animosities, and we don’t have them.” They thought that was a good answer.\\nAW: That is interesting though, why do you think the group has worked so well and that this tour has continued?\\nRB: It was really debatable if it was going to survive till the fifth year. By the fifth year it was clearly working. Whatever we were doing was beneficial and that was about that time we started A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n33\\nhaving guests. We never asked the guest to provide a mailing list. It was just the mailing lists of the seven of us that we were really dependent on. We didn’t do much advertising. We tried the newspaper but that seemed like a waste of money. Later, about five years ago, we started advertising on public radio which was fabulous. I think one of the other—not that it’s a secret—but one of the fundamentals of this group is that they were willing to put up a significant amount of money. We weren’t talking about fifty dollars a person; we were talking about 500 dollars a person. When you have fifty people you suddenly have a lot of money, so you can start having conversations about sponsoring public radio. The other thing that we do in our fee, we require that we have a 6,000 dollar pool that we all pay into equally that we give to a charity of some sort. So that’s $6,000 and it goes to something in ceramics: either an exhibition, or we’ve bought potters wheels for the local high school, we bought a pugmill for one of the schools, we’ve bought a kiln for a school, we’ve given money to Potters for Peace and to the Craft Emergency Relief Fund. Sometimes we’ll meet in September—so I lied about the one meeting—if in our one meeting, we haven’t been able to decide who we’re going to give that money to then we’ll maybe have another one in September to come up with the charity we want to give it to.\\n02:26:32\\nAW: Is that a common feature of other art fairs, or is this another thing that makes the Tour distinct?\\nRB: Early on we had this conversation and the group, we said, “Why don’t we have a philanthropic shade to this? Why don’t we give back to the community?” Because we’re all sort of either right at sixty or past sixty, so, you know, it’s time; you don’t just be on the receiving end. Everybody thought that was a good idea. For four years, back then, we were doing five percent of the total sale, and we were giving that to the Weisman Art Museum for a ceramic purchase fund. We didn’t have any restrictions on it, it just had to be ceramic; we didn’t say it had to be pottery or whatever. So they put a lot of work in their ceramics because of that fund. After that fourth year then we moved it to somewhere else.\\nAW: In those first four years what was five percent of the overall sales?\\nRB: Over those four years we gave them $18,000 dollars.\\nAW: Wow, that’s a substantial amount.\\nRB: I think this year we’ll exceed half a million dollars in sales. We don’t talk to each other about how the sale went at each place. We do talk about it but we don’t have any accurate numbers, you know, people just, “Oh, our place did about this much.” It was over $450,000 last year.\\nAW: From seven studios, seven individuals, plus all the guests. How many total is that?\\nRB: Forty- nine total. So, it was like $9,000, average. And in a potter’s world, that’s a lot. Most people don’t have an event in a year that even comes close. It isn’t life-changing money but what this event does—for all of us—is it gives you this leveling so if you do art fairs or galleries or A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n34\\nexhibitions or studio sales at your own studio, what this does is it’s a big enough amount of money that it kind of levels out their stress. I don’t know if other people in the group will talk about numbers. They might ask you not to mention that number. For some people it is a significant amount of money for their lives. I think what it does is it gives confidence, especially to the new younger potters. If they can count on this, it kind of gives them a base that they can build from. And they’re getting 4,000 or 5,000 people coming to see their work which, if they’re keeping track of people’s addresses and stuff, then they’re building an audience of their own through this event. One thing, Guillermo Cuellar did a survey three years ago and it was the first year—maybe it was four years ago, I think it was the first year we started public radio sponsors—and he surveyed 261 people and thirty-nine percent said it was their first time here. The only thing we did different was we sponsored spots on public radio. Another shocking number that like thirty-one percent were under thirty-five years old. I attribute that to The Current, to putting spots on The Current. It’s been really fascinating to watch it evolve. Like I said earlier, when we went to the color photography poster, it doubled that year. On the twenty-first year, I think it went up seven percent, something like that. It’s just crazy that we’re still growing. We’re actually having parking problems.\\n02:31:54\\nAW: I was just thinking, as you were talking about the 4,000-5,000 people that sounds like a lot of cars, a lot of people, and the coordinating of that, how does that work?\\nRB: I hire my neighbor to help park people, so they did it efficiently; it wasn’t just helter skelter. She gets another person—and I give them walk talkies—she greets them as they come in and the other one walks up and down the road and finds empty spots and tells her, “Yeah, there’s one on the top of the hill.” We also have the golf carts that run up and down so people don’t have to carry their bags to far. Still, at 9:30 on Friday morning, it’s full. I’ve talked to the local church over here and the pastor, they’ve got a big parking lot. We’re working up a potential valet parking thing over at the church or at least delivery, people park over there and we drive up and have a van and bring them over; it’s the overflow.\\nAW: How do you keep track of how many people come through? You said someone greets them, does she have a--?\\nRB: She has a clicker.\\nAW: So you have a pretty exact number?\\nRB: Yeah, except there were ten hours that the show was open that she wasn’t at the show. She counted just over 4,000 last year with ten hours that--\\nAW: --were missing, so even more probably. Wow.\\nRB: And there are people that don’t come here, who go to other places, so I know the number is closer to 5,000 or more. It’s all pretty amazing. I think we did a bunch of things right: we made it all ceramic, which—other tours are successful without doing that—but I think this one, that’s a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n35\\nbig part of it. The other thing is that the artist has to be here so there’s that communication going on. I make my guests bring a helper because I want them not to be wrapping and packing, I want them to talk about their work, so it’s education. And then, we started having guests. I think it broadened the whole appeal of it because it started becoming a ceramic survey—we weren’t just all inviting people who look like us, we were inviting people remarkably different from us. My eight guests, I think there’s only two that you could say they even fit in the same strain. With our guests, we weren’t even asking them to participate with mailings and stuff, that only happened about five years ago where we started asking people to give us their lists because we had woken up to the fact that it had become a national event so these guests were coming from all over the country and they had audience members in their parts of the country so we asked them—our mailing costs went way up but, you know, we sent out 33,000 posters last year. We still send a physical mailing. Once you realize it’s a national event then you have to send the announcement by January 1st, because people need to make their vacation plans. We used to send them out in April but now we send them out in January so that people can get organized, you know, make flights and hotels, and vacation, because they work.\\n02:36:13\\nAW: And it’s always been Mother’s Day weekend?\\nRB: We’ve changed it twice and it didn’t work right, so we moved it back to Mother’s Day. Both times, we moved it off and we’ve moved it back and I said, “I don’t care which weekend we do it, let’s do it consistently from now on.” So we did and I think Mother’s Day has been great. Although, there are a lot of tours which have started up and they’re on Mother’s Day too. What I was hoping was that we would invite each other to all these different places around the country to these tours but if they’re all on the same weekend, you can’t do that. (Laughs). They’re not all on that weekend but, there’s one going on this weekend in Massachusetts and—A lot of these are directly a result of this one. I think that was one of the big strengths of this event is that we showed the possibility of a group getting together and self-promoting and that it’s effective. I don’t think we had been through the idea of a studio tour but I think focusing it on one craft medium and then also, once you have the establishment, see if you can expand it regionally and then expand it nationally and it’s been really effective.\\nAW: When you guys were first starting, do you think it was individual artists, like name and recognition of their work, that brought people in initially and then a sense of this regional thing?\\nRB: That’s always been a debate. When I first invited Mary Barringer, nobody here really knew who Mary was, I mean, there may have been a few people. She established an audience right away because of the quality of her work, people fell in love with it. The next year they came here specifically to find Mary. I think we just have that strong of an audience in Minnesota that when artists come from other parts of the country, or even other parts of the region or state, they’re exposed to this really well educated audience for ceramics. Now, because of the momentum that it has, now we’re getting people coming in from out of state who are collectors and pot lovers and so they’re coming, I think, because of the quantity of artists in one place and the quantity of pots in one place but more importantly the quality. I think we do a good job of treating people well when they get here. It’s the friendly hospitality has been a big part of our philosophy. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n36\\nAW: Something that strikes me is that you’re inviting people onto your property, into your homes, and that’s one thing that makes it special, maybe from other art fairs which are usually in a public space, not necessarily in people’s home where they make the work. Has that made this tour unique that they get to see what you’re surrounded by, you know, your environment?\\nRB: Absolutely. I talked a couple of young potters in Pittsburgh into starting a tour in Pittsburgh. There are a number of them in Minneapolis and stuff, you know. This guy called me up and said, “We did it. We had it.” And I said, “How did it go?” And he goes, “It was overwhelming. Now we have the problem of—now all the people that wouldn’t join us on this first year—now all want to be a part of it. How do you deal with that?” And I said, “Pick the best. I don’t mean to be arrogant about it but, you know, it’s your event, make it the best you can, it doesn’t have to be egalitarian.” In fact, that’s what ruins a lot of them is that people can’t say no. What we decided—I think that was the other thing that was really important—was let’s keep it small and intimate and not make people work too hard to get around the thing. Then, if it’s successful, we can expand it internally. So you still have just seven stops, but now we have fifty-one potters. I just was reading Asparagus Valley Pottery Tour in Massachusetts is this weekend. Mary Barringer is on that tour and a couple of other potters that I know. They asked us about it, how to do it, and they have nine stops and twenty-two potters. They didn’t have guests four years ago. This is their tenth anniversary. So they went six years without have any guests. There’s kind of built-in myth--because selling artwork is difficult, and you get the idea that you’re going to bring other people in to compete with you for what’s perceived as a given pie—and our philosophy has always been that if we make the pie bigger, the results will be bigger. It’s not like you bring in more potters and then the pie gets sliced up finer and finer, that’s just not true. I think that’s baloney. One of the really great things that happened to us was when 2008, when the economy collapsed, when 2009 rolled around you could kind of see—I read the economic pages, I mean, I get The Economist, I read all that stuff. It’s boring for most people but I have that degree, so I still find it fascinating. You could see the winds were changing, you know, it was devastating but it was getting a little better, you know, there were some warm winds starting to blow. I was getting a lot of calls from guests that were saying, “What do you think?” I said, “It’s going to be the best one ever.” And they were like, “No way.” And I said, “No, if you don’t bring all the pots you can bring, you’re crazy, because it’s going to be the best one ever.” And they said, “How can you say that?” And I go, “Because it’s more important now. People are hurt, but it’s going to be good.” They all did, they all brought plenty of work, and we had the best one ever. I think MPR did a survey that year of all the arts organizations around, and they called me up and they said, “Well, you guys have this event, how is the economy affecting you?” I said, “We added fourteen percent more artists and we had record sales.” I think the Guthrie and all these people cutting programs and slashing the budgets, I think it was an absolute huge mistake. I think they went exactly the wrong direction. I think maybe if they would have said to staff, “Well, maybe we’re going to cut your hours a little bit but everyone’s going to stay employed. And you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to do more concerts, we’re going to do more performances, and we’re going to do more free ones, because what we’re going to do is to build our audience for ten years from now and we’re going to use this downtime to talk to people about how important art is in their lives. Instead, they all kind of hid their head in the sand and said, “This is a terrible time and we’ve got to cut this play and that play and this performance.” I just think that was stupid, horribly stupid. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n37\\n02:45:45\\nAW: And so even in 2010 and 2011, as people were still recovering, it has continued to grow?\\nRB: It’s grown every year. I think in the whole history of the thing it’s only gone backwards one year and that was because two people didn’t have as many guests. They went from five to none. So, we went from maybe twenty-five guests to nineteen guests. There were fewer pots. It hasn’t been on a curve like that [makes steep upward gesture with hand] but it’s gone up two, three, four, ten percent every year. It’s just silly.\\nAW: That is amazing. On the topic of guests, when did you start inviting guests?\\nRB: I think on the fifth year.\\nAW: So that was--?\\nRB: Nineteen ninety-seven, maybe.\\nAW: And what was the criteria for inviting guests?\\nRB: Your friends, people you respected.\\nAW: How did you pick your first guests?\\nRB: I picked John Turula because he’s a great ceramics sculptor and he’s a friend of long [standing]. He didn’t think he would, he said, “Well, it’s a pottery show. What would I bring” He makes these wonderful whimsical sculptures and tile and clay. He sold a couple, but the week afterwards he got a $20,000 commission from somebody who came to this event. He was probably a fish out of water, sort of, but he had great results from it. Then I invited Mary Barringer who is an old friend who I met in Washington D.C. at a ceramics event there, we just go along really good. She’s a tremendous ceramics artist. Her partner, or girlfriend, is just one of the best people on the planet so if I can invite Mary then I can get her partner to come. Then I was like, Why one? Why not two or three?\\nAW: The first year was one?\\nRB: One, but some people had more, I just had one. But the next year I had two.\\nAW: John and Mary?\\nRB: No, John, he never came back.\\nAW: How do you spell his last name?\\nRB: T-u-r-u-l-a, Turula. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n38\\nAW: So the second year was two different guests and the third year--?\\nRB: And then the third year I had a third. Then, the question within my own guests was—because I wanted to have a fourth—well, there was an argument about, “Will the dynamics between having four people here or having five people here might get significantly strange?” I thought about that so I didn’t add a person. Then the next year I thought, That was crazy. My gut feeling is the more the merrier. I didn’t want to blow it up until I was sure that it was good for everybody. So now I have eight guests and the group has decided that’s the ceiling, which I would argue that I’d like to have one more. Then I could have a rotational pool, so I can have people be in for three years and out a year and in for three and out a year and then I can have a pool of twelve to fifteen people. That would be interesting. But they’re my friends so I invite the same ones every year.\\n02:49:56\\nAW: So everyone comes back?\\nRB: That want to. I’ve had three people not come back, for whatever reason. One I didn’t invite. And two—one of them, her husband died the next spring, so she couldn’t come; and I had a woman here from Scotland, Hannah McAndrew, and she had gotten a grant from the Scottish government to do this and she didn’t think she could get it this year, so she didn’t come back. Which was too bad because she did really well and it was really nice to see her work which was an old English slipware, kind of in a traditional vein but not too traditional, beautiful work and just a lovely person. I would like her to come back. I think it takes awhile to build an audience, even though we have this special audience, I think people need a second and a third and a fourth year to establish the depth of an audience, and that’s why I just want people to keep coming.\\nAW: What was it like to have an international artist be part of the Tour?\\nRB: She was just a potter with an accent. And, she didn’t like biscuits and gravy (laughs). We went out for breakfast one morning and she was like, “No way would I eat that. I can’t believe you’re eating it.” I ordered it because I thought she should try a colloquial, you know, United States thing that you probably don’t see anywhere else, but she didn’t want that.\\nAW: When guests come they have to pay their own way to get out here?\\nRB: Yep, they have to. All their expenses, including the helper I require them to bring, is at their expense. They can hire somebody locally, which some of them do, or they bring somebody with them.\\nAW: And are any of them from the local area or are they from other places?\\nRB: Jason Trebs is from St. Paul, Jo Severson is from Clearwater, Minnesota. Matt Metz used to live in Houston, Minnesota but now he lives in New York State, and he’s been coming since he lived here. Where else? I think the rest of them are from out of state. Craig Edwards is going to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n39\\nbe here this year, first time; he’s from New London. I have somebody from Massachusetts; a couple from North Carolina; Matt Metz from New York state; and everybody else is local.\\nAW: Where do they stay? Do they stay here?\\nRB: No they don’t. We used to house everybody and we were having thirty-five people for breakfast. We have six queen size beds up there--\\nAW: In the bunkhouse?\\nRB: --and a couch, and then we have one, two, three extra beds besides our own. We had nine beds of people plus the couch and this couch if it was available. Some people were camping. It was getting to be too much pressure on my wife so now I make all the income-earning people get a hotel or stay with friends, but any of the helpers can stay here for free. So the ones that aren’t making any money, they get free room and board.\\nAW: Oh, that’s nice. That’s really generous.\\nRB: Well, it’s not—I mean, it’s just what you should do. So, we’ll have food going all day for all the helpers. Back in this back bedroom we’ll have a break room back there so people can go back there and have enchiladas—I think I’ll make enchiladas, and some posole, and some leek potato soups, and then we’ll probably have bread and cheese and meat, chips and salsa. My wife will probably make vegetarian chili; she’s vegetarian. Saturday night, there’s a guy from Chicago, he comes up and he’s here all weekend. He’s this incredible cook—he’s from Bangladesh—and he’ll put on a Bangladeshi dinner Saturday night here for everybody. He just completely destroys the kitchen; it’s great. (Laughs)\\n02:55:28\\nAW: He cooks for everybody who is here?\\nRB: Everybody, yeah.\\nAW: When did he start coming up here? How did you get to know him?\\nRB: I didn’t remember this but he and I had a show together in Chicago at Will Street Gallery. We talked but I didn’t remember him. He called up Monday and said, “Hi, this is Kareem. I want to know if you could use some help in the kitchen for your pottery tour.” I said, “Sure.” He came and brought a friend—Ernie, just buddies—and the two of them just cooked up a storm and helped the kitchen crew make all this food. He’s been coming ever since. Now, another friend of his, John Roquette, from Mississippi, comes up every year and helps; just an incredible human being.\\nAW: Does sound like a great opportunity to meet people, artists, people who love pottery, and just people you’ve connected with; the friendships that have developed and bring people here. That’s amazing. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n40\\nRB: Yeah, and my hockey playing friend, Carol, she and her partner—I never know how women who are married, how they refer to their spouse or partner, I asked them that—Carol, who was an apprentice of mine, probably thirty years ago in Minneapolis at that studio—and we’ve been friends ever since. She‘s quit being a potter—she never really got into that—she became a master electrician and now she’s selling real estate. She and her partner, Erika, they come out and run the sales tent. We have right people in there packing and wrapping. That changes everyday. Northern Clay Center has an option for their employees—they can either work at Northern Clay on Friday or they can come out here, or one of the stops, and volunteer. So, that’s how we get all these people to help.\\nAW: That’s a big thing—dozens and dozens of people who are helping the event happen and all the visitors who come through. That’s a lot of people who come through here in one weekend.\\nRB: Yeah, and it just seems to work, and it doesn’t seem like we’re managing anything. It just seems like it happens. I know that my wife has managed a lot of the kitchen and carol and Erica manage the sales tent, and I mostly drink beer (Laughs).\\nAW: (Laughs) Well, you’re managing the production of pottery. Seems like people volunteer to help and when here, everyone goes into their role and you don’t have to have a lot of oversight on individuals and what they’re doing?\\nRB: No, there are decisions made all the time. If something screws up, if a credit card machine breaks, you have to figure out how to compensate for that. Or, if the phone line doesn’t work anymore…\\nAW: I’m guessing it’s probably gotten late. We have just some last reflection questions. I’ll start with this one: what are your fondest memories of the Tour?\\nRB: Yeah, we were talking about that today. One of the things is the year the economy collapsed, and it just proved to be stronger than that; that was really pleasant. When people come from out of state who you met in other places, it’s jaw-dropping. It’s like, Wow, this is wonderful that you came. There’s just so many things: looking out and seeing seven or eight tents out in the yard; or students coming up from Nebraska—they can’t afford a hotel—they come up in a group, and they camp out in the back yard and ramble in here and take showers. It’s great.\\n03:00:40\\nAW: I think it’s interesting from how you described when you first got into pottery, you didn’t really have a community like this around to support you along the way. Is that important to you now to provide that support and encouragement for young artists?\\nRB: Yeah, I’m not real fond of being the center of anything; I like to be part of other things. I don’t like to be considered “the guy,” but I do think that having this as a tool to show younger people that it’s actually possible to make a living [with ceramics]—I think that’s really huge. I think it has. It makes it more plausible, comparing it to when a lot of us started, the idea of A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n41\\ninventing something from nothing. Now, I think it’s cool that you don’t have to invent it from nothing. You just have to use your wits and your own hard work, and it’s possible. Your choices aren’t either to be a teacher or waiter potter, or lawyer potter—if you want to, you can actually choose to be a potter. I think this shows that.\\nThere’s one little story—I was doing an art fair in Des Moines and there was a young woman who came in and said, “I want to start a tour like yours.” She said, “ Do you have time to interview you?” I said, “Sure.” We sat down behind my booth and we talked for two hours. I told her, “Here’s what you should do, here’s what you shouldn’t do. Whatever you do, don’t do this. Whatever you do, do this. Don’t take any public money. Keep it small. Keep it intimate. Invite the best people.” They are thirty-five miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, and it’s called the North Omaha Pottery Trail. She started this thing, and I would get her brochure every year in the mail, announcing it. No guests, but it was only five or six studios. The graphics were, you know, not really cool; it wasn’t that interesting. The fifth year, I have it, I got this really nice thing, this really beautifully put together graphic piece. I called her up and said, “This is really excellent.” I just said it over her answering machine. “It really feels like you’ve turned a corner.” She called me back and we talked for a while. She said, “Yeah, this year we had eight hundred people,” come to their tour, which is thirty-five miles north of Omaha. Last year, they had eight hundred people both Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\\nAW: --they doubled.\\nRB: Yeah, and now it’s become this regional thing for them. People come down. Now they’re inviting guests. It’s starting to rock and roll. It’s fun to see it. There’s tours over in Wisconsin—there must be five or six of them that have fashioned from this one. There’s one in Massachusetts. There’s one in Syracuse, New York, that started because of this one. One in Tampa, Florida. There’s a really good one that’s starting up in Austin, Texas called the Art of the Pot and they’re just having really good success. It’s fun to see it. I’m not seeing that we did everything for all these things, but I think we showed people that it’s possible to do something pretty big and have it have an impact. I have this perverse hope that ten years from now that there will actually be a million people in the United States that have fallen in love with pottery and that no matter where you are in the country, if you really want to do it, you can do it.\\n03:05:57\\nAW: What are your hopes for the Tour in the future?\\nRB: I think now I just want it to maintain itself and, at the same time, I want to pass it on to another generation—which we’re doing here, Mary and I. We’re selling the place to a young potter so they’ll be able to carry it on. I think other people will figure out how they can pass their thing on. Have the legacy of this thing be that it didn’t just go for twenty-five or thirty years, that it’s sixty years that another generation will run it, and they’ll do just as well with it. And, change it however they need to make it relevant to their generation, their audience, their desires. I think that’s very possible.\\nAW: What makes it possible? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nR. Briscoe\\n04/26/14\\n42\\nRB: Minnesota, I think.\\nAW: Why is there so much support for pottery in Minnesota?\\nRB: I think it’s rooted in Warren MacKenzie.

Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb, who is a project assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed, Linda, and why don’t we get started? First if you could tell us when and where were you born?\\nLC: Well, I just found my baby book, that’s really funny. I was born in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, in 1952. That’s not the town where I lived but it was the town that had a hospital.\\nAW: What was the town where you lived?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n2\\nLC: It was a little town called Barron, Wisconsin, which is kind of a good name although it’s spelled B-a-r-r-o-n. It was just a little agricultural lumber town with two railroads, which was interesting—two railroads that intersected. I ended up playing a lot at the railroad tracks. I really liked the railroad. We had a river and a creek and I grew up on a little creek. Through the woods was a creamery, so I spent a lot of time there at the creamery. (Laughs)\\nAW: Working or helping out?\\nLC: Oh, just observing and playing. I spent a lot of time with the butter makers. I really liked that idea—as a child I liked the idea of industry and making something. There was a big room where they had a couple of big butter churns and I really liked the whole process of making butter and the butter makers—they were very interesting to me because they were so observant and they could hear the butter and they could tell what was going on just by listening. They were so observant. The whole idea of making something that’s beautiful, delicious, becomes part of you, actually, becomes part of your body. I actually thought about that as a kid. It just was really impressive to me. It was aesthetic; it was pleasing in everyway. It had everything. (Laughs)\\nAW: Did you ever get a chance to churn butter yourself?\\nLC: Oh, yeah I think I did. As you do as a kid, we could go to the creamery and get cream. My mom would send us to the creamery with a jar and fifty cents and bring cream home and shake it. But the scale was not the same, it was different. I didn’t want to become a butter maker or anything like that, but it impressed me that it was a career and it was public service; it kind of had everything. It was hard work, actually. There were two women that sat in a room packaging butter and that was fascinating too. They just sat and gossiped. I would just sit and listen to them and watch them. Their job didn’t seem as interesting to me, but that was their job was to put the butter in a—actually there was a little machine that had wax paper and squirted out the butter and folded it into this beautiful little rectangle. These women would pick it up and put it in a box and they would just sit and gossip about everyone in the town. That was really fascinating to me as well, just their occupation—it wasn’t as aesthetically pleasing but they just sat and gossiped and that was fascinating to me from a—I don’t know what kind of viewpoint, maybe as a sociologist or something? It was just fascinating listening to these women over many years. All they did was gossip and work with their hands—they were really factory workers. They just did repetitive work but they gossiped. It was fascinating and it sustained them. It could never sustain me, but it sustained their life. It was fascinating to me. I couldn’t wait to leave the little town (laughs), but it was really fascinating to have this sort of industry just through the woods from my house.\\n00:05:20\\nThere were a couple of other people I spent time with. The milk can haulers—they could lift up two milk cans full of milk at the one time, one with each hand. I don’t know what a milk can weighs now but they were super strong. They were like brutes in a way but they were very interesting to me, their job. They would pull up to a little door and knock the lid off with a metal rod and then—well, the can would go through a door, inside they would knock the lid off and dump it. As kids we would ride on the milk can covers down a little conveyor belt. That was like our playground; that was super fun. You’d get kind of a ring on your butt from the milk can lids. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n3\\nWe’d come home filthy because they burned coal at the creamery. Everything was coated with this coal dust, and my mother, I know, would always be angry—I’d come home just filthy.\\nThe other place I would go would be down to the boiler where the guy—I thought it was the greatest job in the world—he would sit in a chair outside, leaning against a wall, there would be a little creek there. He could hear when the boiler needed coal, and he’d go inside and shovel coal into the boiler. He’d open the door—it’s sort of like a kiln, really—it was really hot. He’d go in and shovel the coal around and then sit down. I thought that was a really great job. I got to shovel some coal. It was great as a kid to have this sort of factory. It just had everything you could want really, to observe and look at. It was a playground. It was sort of my entertainment. There was a lot to explore. I guess I was the kind of kid that liked to figure out stuff; what’s going on—kind of like a detective, in a way, you know, what’s going on? How does it fit together? What’s the story? I think I would have made a good detective probably. (Laughs)\\nAW: (Laughs) Yeah, certainly if you could connect with those butter ladies and hear what they were hearing. You could have made quite a detective in that town.\\nLC: (Laughs) Yeah, everybody had their own sort of job. There was the train too. The train brought the coal and I liked watching the train goods loading and unloading and then the coal would come to the creamery and they would dump it. That was kind of fascinating too. The whole thing was really an interesting process, interesting to have it as a kid; as part of your daily life like, if I was bored I would go over there and poke around and watch something being made.\\nIt’s very unusual to talk about myself—I’ll just put that there. Usually my role is to ask you questions, as visitors; I want to know about you more than you should want to know about me.\\nAW: It is unusual for many people to do that, but this is really interesting to hear about your early childhood and what attracted you to the creamery like you were saying, observing all these people and their jobs and how they did their jobs. What creamery was this? Do you remember the name?\\nLC: It was called the Barron Cooperative Creamery. It was torn down a few years ago. You can still see it on Google Earth—most of it; a lot of it is gone.\\n00:10:00\\nAW: Did you have siblings? You said, “We.”\\nLC: Yeah, I have an older brother, four years older. He would go over there too but not as much as myself and my best friend would go over there a lot. We played there a lot. There was a milk can house. That was sort of our main play area, really, where they stored the milk cans.\\nAW: What was that like?\\nLC: It was kind of a big shed. It had two sides to it and the height was just right so the milk cans could be unloaded into the shed and then they would be stored there when they were dry. When A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n4\\nthe milk truck came, when they would unload, then they would pick up dry milk cans from the shed. They were constantly moving them in and out. Gee, that was sort of our big playroom, really. We made up all sorts of stories and we had characters that—there were two brothers that sort of lived there, we think, who we called the Gold Dust Twins. I don’t know if we made this up or if they really did live there. That would be something that I should really research, these hobo brothers—kind of like gypsies in a way. We had a rich imaginary life, I guess, growing up in a little town. There wasn’t a whole lot to do—you’d go to the bowling alley or a church function. There really wasn’t much to do. I was really busy—the library—but the creamery was my main kind of area.\\nAW: And who was your best friend?\\nLC: Her name is Gretchen Smith.\\nAW: Have you guys remained in contact?\\nLC: Yeah, she’s writing a book now about her childhood but she wrote a book about her young adult life. She married an older fellow who panned for gold in Alaska, so she moved to Alaska and lived that kind of a rural, very primitive rustic life for many years. She just wrote a book about it.\\nThe other thing about the creamery that was unique—our town was very progressive in that the creamery had a big steam boiler. Everything ran off steam. They made too much steam—whoever engineered the boiler made it too big—so they shipped steam through a steam pipe quite a distance. How far? I don’t know, maybe half a mile to three-quarters of a mile. They shipped it above ground in an insulated pipe and they heated two schools and the library and I believe a church. They recycled the steam. It’s very unusual—it’s sort of like Iceland or something. It was very neat. We played a lot on this steam pipe. It was like an elevated pipe. It seemed really high but it probably wasn’t all that high. But it was pretty high where it left the creamery and that was the big thrill for all the kids in town was to dare to climb the steam pipe—walk on top of it—up to the exit of the creamery. They had a water tower too that everybody climbed and painted and that kind of thing. I was the kind of kid that would always do something like that on a dare, or even on my own, actually, just to do it. It was kind of fun. The steam pipe was great. It was on my way to school and Gretchen and I would hop on it and run down it until it went underground. It was above ground and then it went underground for a while. We would always run on the above-ground part. It was fun. It was a great way to grow up.\\nAW: You said on your walk to school? Tell us about your school. What was that like?\\nLC: Well, we’d walk through our woods and then down our hill across a little bridge and then the steam pipe was through a little creek valley. The first school I went to was through the woods. That was a traditional old brick school, which was a beautiful school that had beautiful woodwork—you know, the traditional brick school that would be two or three stories tall. Always, I think, in those schools they had a gym in the middle of the school that always had a balcony around the gym, and a stage—just the traditional old beautiful classrooms with big windows and beautiful woodwork. The kind of schools they tear down. It’s gone now, of course, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n5\\nbut it was kind of a small school district. I was supposed to go to a country school—a one-room schoolhouse—and I was very disappointed. I think I was the first class that didn’t go. My brother went to a one-room schoolhouse for a little while. I really looked forward to that and didn’t end up doing that. It was a traditional little town school. We had a lot of great things about it though. The greatest thing was—because we were a small school—all the kids would come together at the high school in the gym, and we’d have what was called a lyceum. L-y-c-e-u-m. I’ve never really looked up that word—I should because I love words—but I think a lyceum must be a place, a gathering where you’re shown something that’s remarkable. It could be remarkable for many reasons. We had a guy that had throat cancer who came to talk to the schools and he smoked through his—he had a tracheotomy—and he’d say, “Don’t ever smoke,” and he’d be smoking. He’d put his cigarette up to his tracheotomy and say, “Don’t ever smoke like me.” He was fantastic, he was terrific. The best one was steel drummers from Jamaica. I don’t know if it was Jamaica now that I think about but they were really great. They sent shivers up my spine. I’ll never forget that. I had never heard of them, never seen them before in my life. They came. They were sort of one of the first glimmers of hope that I had of escaping the little town. I loved the little town in many ways, but it was so small-minded and I was the kind of kid that knew that there must be something different out there. The steel drums were the first glimmer of something bigger that I ever had. But the lyceum thing: I think it’s probably something that’s really worth revitalizing. It makes me think, if I had nothing to do, if I didn’t know what to do, I think I would try to get some of this Legacy funding and do the lyceum thing in Minnesota with cultural, historical, artistic history, I guess, basically. I would take it to schools. I guess you probably do this now through film, and all sorts of ways are possible now. But there’s nothing like watching someone do something or hear someone in person, I think. It’s different than a film. There’s something about this one on one or one on a thousand. I think the lyceum model is really an incredible model for children. If I had nothing to do with my life I think I would devote myself to it.\\n00:19:54\\nAW: Were there other speakers or groups you remember that stood out?\\nLC: We had a woman that came and she was really fascinated with the First Ladies of the United States. Like the presidents’ wives. She sewed the inauguration gown from every first lady—I can’t remember how many there were—then she would do a little fashion show and talk about the first ladies and what was remarkable about them.\\nOh we had the guy who does the electric ball, where you put your hand on the ball and your hair goes out. We had the Harlem Globetrotters. They were really great. They were very cool.\\nAW: What school were you in?\\nLC: It’s called Barron Area Schools.\\nAW: How many students?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n6\\nLC: In the whole school? I don’t know, maybe three hundred or so. Not too many. I just got awarded something from my school. I’m kind of mortified. It’s like a Hall of Fame—people who are do-gooders who do good and they bring you back as a role model. I’m kind of terrified, I don’t know if I have to go and speak or anything. It’s really kind of terrifying to me.\\nOur town had something else that was kind of amazing, and my parents were instrumental in it. My parents were college educated and when they would go home to their homes for Christmas or Thanksgiving or Easter or something, the foreign students from their college didn’t have a place to go. They had a lot of people from interesting places like Sudan, Kenya, Japan, China, Taiwan—but the Africans are the ones I remember. My parents, after they had been married a while, they started to think about that as part of their—I guess you’d call it public service—they decided they should do something about it—that those students should have a place to go that was with a family that was welcoming. It would not only give them a family to bond with and have sort of an extended home life, it would give them the opportunity to go somewhere and if they enjoyed the people and vice versa they would have a relationship with these people for their college life. It might even extend longer and it might lead to some kind of international relations. It was really my mother’s idea and I think she talked my dad into it. Anyway, they talked some other people into it and then all the little churches—not all, but a lot of the churches—in our town got together and started this foreign student program. It had a name but I don’t remember what it was called. It was just fascinating—you could walk down the main street of this little town and you could see these beautiful men from Sudan walking down the street with their beautiful white native clothing on, this beautiful grey black skin and these beautiful white gowns. People would just turn their head, in this little white community and these beautiful people from other countries and they had pride in their native clothing. It was really something. It was really a wonderful thing to have had as part of my childhood, to have had all of these foreign students. That again gave me a sense of there’s something bigger, something bigger intellectually beyond this little town. I didn’t necessarily have to stay in the little town. There was something bigger. I was really grateful for that. As an adult now looking back on it, I can see that I was sort of resentful—resent is probably a little too strong—but I realize now that I had to share my parents with these foreign students. I feel like I didn’t always want to share them, my parents. When I look back at holidays, when I look back at pictures, there’s all these interesting foreign students and they were great—they were part of our family—but they sort of came and went. In hindsight now, now that my parents are dead, I miss my parents. I miss just us. We always had these extra people. It was really rich, but I also feel sort of a sadness, I guess. I wouldn’t call it resentment; (sighs) I don’t know what you would call it. Bittersweet, I guess, rich and sad. But that was pretty neat, really, as a kid, and as a town, it was really a wonderful thing for the town.\\n00:26:42\\nI recently found out that there are a lot of Somalis in this town now. There is a whole culture there, there’s an Islamic center, and their soccer team went to state and I think it’s mostly Somalis who are on the soccer team. It’s really cool. It’s really, really neat. We also had a migrant population who came in the summer to pick peas and corn, and that was always interesting, too. A lot of people from Mexico and people from southern states would kind of come and go during the summer. That was always really interesting. We had some native people—there was a reservation to the north—and sometimes we would have Native Americans A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n7\\nin the school. Not too many, but sometimes we would have a few families. We had other religious people. We had a few Amish; they didn’t go to our school but we had Mennonites. We had quite a few Mennonites in our school up to a certain grade. They were always interesting to me because their belief system was so different than mine. They were fascinating to me because they had such a strong belief. I guess I was always curious about what people thought and what they believed and I was able to just—I was sort of like as sociologist in a way, I think, as a kid. I was interested in other people’s views and beliefs even though I didn’t share it. I was able to be objective, I guess; I had an ability to be objective about it just because I was curious. That was really interesting to me. They would usually quit school—I can’t remember what grade—but there were these twin girls, Shirley and Sharon, who went on to nursing school and I admired them so much because they really bucked the system. They had a drive to be nurses and they did it against the wishes of their community and their family. It was very interesting to me.\\nAW: What were some of the dynamics between these groups? What were some of your observations about that? Were there places where people kept to themselves or places or activities where people intersected and merged together? What were the dynamics you remember?\\nLC: I think it was pretty different than small towns today. People really associated with their own religion. There were church groups for children. Most people went to a church, they were raised in a church, you were expected to go to church and go to the youth groups, and really that was your group of friends were from your church. Or Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts. Boys had sports so they had that sort of social group. Girls had your church group, 4-H—4-H was a big deal—that was kind of your world. You were expected to stay in that little group, unless you were part of a club--4-H, that was the other big group: church, 4-H and boys with sports.\\n00:31:32\\nAW: Were you part of any of those groups?\\nLC: I was in 4-H for a little bit. The church group? Yeah, I had to go to the church thing, I had to go.\\nAW: What denomination?\\nLC: Methodist. I was lucky because our church was pretty active politically during the Vietnam War. We were really active. My mother was very progressive, even though she had grown up in a small town, but she was college educated and she had a thing with justice. She came from a family of lawyers and judges and she had a really strong sense of justice, both local and international, in all ways. I think today she would probably have a really interesting career. She was a municipal justice of the peace. She did a lot of letter writing, you know, letters to the editor. There was a group called Another Mother for Peace during the Vietnam War. They read a lot and wrote letters. They didn’t pay their telephone tax. The telephone tax, I think, supported the Department of Defense but it was directly linked to the Vietnam War, the telephone tax. They would go around trying to get people to write a letter to the telephone company and not pay their tax. She would arrange speakers to come. She would try and get the Berrigan brothers to A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n8\\ncome. Because I was from Wisconsin, Madison was a real hotbed of anti-war movement. There was a bombing and the local people wanted our county to not give money to the state to give to the university. It would also affect county extension money, which was really important in our area for farming and 4-H. My mother arranged for some speakers to come to our little town and do some presentations about the war and the University of Wisconsin and how it was all related. She actually got death threats. It was really kind of amazing, in a little town, in 1968 or 1969. I would pick up the phone and it would be—turns out I know who it was now—it was one of my friend’s father, who was kind of a crazy man. At the time we didn’t know who it was, but I remember him telling me how beautiful it would be seeing my brother and I and my parents flying through the air in pieces.\\nAW: Oh god, that’s awful.\\n00:35:40\\nLC: Yeah, all because someone comes to your town and speaks about something that you don’t agree with, that kind of thing. It was really kind of an odd childhood in a certain kind of way. Growing up with great beauty and all the charm of a little town but very small-minded. There were a lot of very small-minded people. I was lucky to have parents who were curious and intellectuals. I don’t know that I would call my dad an intellectual but my mother was a real intellectual. Didn’t live an intellectual life per se, in her career, but she was concerned with justice, language, words, that kind of thing. My dad, he was a map drawer so what I got from him was the observation, a way to record observation, or something to do with observation that interests you: nature, camping, that kind of thing, sports, I guess. I wouldn’t even call it sports. I’d call it moving with a purpose, which sports might be part of that, but moving through the landscape with a purpose. I had a great childhood in that kind of way; it was really, really, rich. But very small-minded—I came out bitter in a certain way towards my town and the small-mindedness of it. Bitter? Maybe that’s strong but I couldn’t wait to leave. That was the small-mindedness, I mean somebody would call you up and threaten your life for your ideas. In my mind, ideas were very, very important. My brother, as well, ideas were very, very important and what you do with ideas was very important. So to be challenged with your life seemed really remarkably bizarre, and I guess it was scary, but not too scary.\\nI really admired my mother that she could live her ideals and her ideas in a little town. It was really remarkable. She was really sort of out of place in many ways, I think, and I felt out of place. I was rebellious, certainly, but I felt really out of sync with the town. Certainly not out of sync with certain parts of it: the aesthetics were really great in so many ways. I was really a visual kid and I was not out of place visually but, I just looked around and thought, Man, I got to get out of here as quick as I can. So I did, but I just wanted out. It just seemed like the women had a pretty rough road and when I looked at careers and man, I just didn’t see anything there for me. I couldn’t wait to get out of there as quick as I could. It’s interesting now I live in an area where it’s very similar, although I live rural, you know, I’m not in the little town. I could never live in any of the little towns around me. So I get the benefits of a lot of my childhood—I can live out the benefits now; I can pick and choose the benefits of it. Yeah, it’s probably pretty different now in that little town. I’m sure it’s very different. It’s much more international now with a high percentage of Somalis live there. I mean I think it’s probably a lot richer now. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n9\\nThere’s a cross country ski trail there. It’s probably really terrific there now; it’s probably really great there now. But it was very small-minded. The little newspaper had a gossip column: who was serving coffee for who, who was dating who, and our little school newspaper was all about gossip, basically, who’s dating who. I was the high school yearbook editor as a senior and we wrote about the draft—it was during the Vietnam War—and we wrote about what was going on politically, and the school told us we couldn’t publish the paper because it wasn’t right to write about those things. So we did it anyway. We took over a little printing press and did everything by hand and published it anyway, with drawings and poetry and things like that. We wrote about what people were worrying about. Kids were worrying about the draft and, How come girls weren’t drafted? That was a real question that a lot of us girls had. How come the boys had to think about this and we didn’t have to think about this? How come that is? Why is that? I don’t know; it was like even the teachers didn’t want us to raise it as a topic. Most of them didn’t seem to care about it and it was always curious to me, Why don’t people care about this? That really bothered me. I just felt like I was really out of place with my curiosity and my sense of justice and aesthetics. I was really upset by things aesthetically—things really bothered me aesthetically.\\n00:43:34\\nAW: Like what?\\nLC: Well, that’s a good question. Like what? (Laughs) I guess this is your job to do this; this is good. As a kid, even as a little kid, some of my earliest memories were—I remember walking down the street and I’d look at a building and I’d think, Well, if you put that window over there and take that door and move that over there, I really think it would look better. In my mind’s eye better, it would look better. Well what’s “better?” Now I see it as, Well, it’s just a visual opportunity and I’m always trying to sort out, What’s the information? What’s going on? What’s the information you’re given? Given this information—two windows and a door, three windows and a door—what’s the most interesting way you could arrange them? What do I mean by interesting? What looks pleasing to your eye but also sets up a tension or something? What’s a tension that’s interesting, you know, besides the given of balance—what most people think looks balanced, something you would walk by and not even pay attention to—how could you arrange it in a way that you would pay attention to it that’s interesting and beautiful? Given just a little set of givens—two windows and a door, three windows and a door—how could you set up in a way that’s really interesting and beautiful at the same time? Those are the kinds of things that I like to do, that I did actually, I couldn’t help myself, couldn’t stop myself as a kid. So I was the loiterer, I was the kid that couldn’t get anywhere on time because I was interested in what was going on. I realized kind of quickly that other kids could give a shit about that, you know, they didn’t care about it. Nobody cared about it. Even the adults didn’t care about it. So I always felt like I was sort of odd in a way; I always had that about me. I kind of did it, I couldn’t help myself; it’s probably like being a sociopath or something. There’s probably a word for it. It’s probably a diagnosable condition or something. (Laughs) I don’t think it really is but it could lead to something like that probably. That’s probably what—writers probably have this, artists probably have it, architects probably have it, musicians probably have it too—in a musical kind of way. You probably can’t help yourself. You can’t help paying attention to it. I guess, as I got older, it would lead to, you know, if I had been inclined to something like fashion it would have led to a fashion career, but I didn’t really care about fashion. I was interested in buildings and I think I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n10\\ncould have been an architect. I actually did try to sign up for architectural drawing, but they wouldn’t let girls do it when I was in high school—that kind of closed a door on that. When I started taking drawing that was great for me because it was a way I could sort of narrow what I was seeing and I could pick and choose what I paid attention to visually. Back to your question which was—what was your question about?\\nAW: About examples of feeling frustrated with the aesthetics?\\nLC: I think the frustration was realizing that I was different in a way from other kids. Other kids didn’t care about how things related to each other in a visual way. And then things started to bother me—things like little trailer parks, or the way people would just throw things away, dumps—I mean, I like dumps; in a certain way I liked a lot of dumps, I liked old dumps. But new dumps bothered me aesthetically. Even with fashion I was sort of bothered by fashion, I guess. I grew up with mostly clothing that my mother had made, and that really bothered me too because it wasn’t aesthetically what I would pick. I found it really homely. I didn’t necessarily like the fabric. The fabric really bothered me aesthetically yet I couldn’t come up with fabric that I would love. I did eventually find fabric that I loved, of course. That really bothered me, I felt that there was something wrong with me that I couldn’t embrace this. My brother couldn’t either and he finally took a stand and said, “No more, I’m not wearing this.” But I felt I had to be polite, so I always felt sort of odd at school. There were other kids that grew up that way too. We probably could have had a little club together. I always thought boys had it a little easier because they could just wear blue jeans and t-shirts.\\n00:50:50\\nAW: Can you describe some of the fabrics or some of the outfits that your mom made for you? Were you expected to wear skirts or dresses?\\nLC: Oh yeah. We had to wear dresses or skirts, even in the wintertime; it’s like bare legs; it’s just goofy to walk a mile or so to school. I mean, we’d wear snow pants and stuff like that, but I remember really liking pedal pushers and we couldn’t wear that at school, but I thought pedal pushers were really great. They’re kind of like Capri pants. In the summer I wore shorts and jeans and I guess you could say I was a tomboy. I played softball and did all that. A lot of girls did that, climbed trees, but, yeah, in school you had to wear dresses and skirts. I guess as I got older I sort of found things that I like—I like blue denim work shirts. I could accept that as an okay thing to wear. I would wear that a lot with a skirt. That was kind of odd. People would wear flower prints. I guess as the hippie thing kind of settled in, I liked the hippie wardrobe. That was sort of a relief to me. I could sort of embrace that. I couldn’t wait to get away from home and dress the way I wanted to and feel like I could be myself more. I could be myself in my home but I couldn’t be myself in my town or school. I couldn’t get excited about school dances and that kind of thing.\\nI was the girls’ track team because I could beat the boys. I was the girls’ track team for a year or two and then there was another girl too. We were always better or as good as the boys. We had a boys’ track coach that encouraged us to run. That was another thing that was kind of a point of difference—feeling odd and feeling pride at the same time—kind of bittersweet, kind of a skill. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n11\\nWe would have these all school track meets and I learned early on that I could outrun the boys and it was like, Oh wow, really, that’s really interesting—to find out something about yourself. It’s like, Oh, I never would have thought of that. But then it’s what do you do with it? It was kind of an odd skill to have.\\nGuess the other nice thing I had from my family, my father—we didn’t call it this but he was a cross-country skier. Both my brother and I grew up skiing but never remembered learning it. We skied as soon as we could stand. We always did that. That was just great. When there was too much snow, my dad would do errands for all the old people in town. We’d ski around to all the old people’s houses and see what they needed and go to the drug store, get their groceries or whatever. We’d have packs on. I just thought, God, this is great, really great. We had a couple of hills in town. We had one hill, Bull Hill, and there was a toboggan slide there. It sort of looked like a ski jump, only it was a slide. You’d take your skis off and get a toboggan and climb up and sit on it and slide down—god, it was so great. We’d always ski over there and go up the toboggan slide on our skis. My dad had been a ski jumper and so we would also go around to the ski jumps in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. My brother and I, our job would be to pack the [snow] where they would jump off and they would land. By hand you’d put your skis on and walk up and down the hill. I thought, Wow, this is really great. That was really fun. I really wanted to be a ski jumper. They didn’t let girls do it and I was like, What? You have to be kidding! It was one of those things like when I was a girl there were certain things that were closed to you—you couldn’t play baseball, you couldn’t be a ski jumper. A lot of things like that. It was shocking to me, like, What?! There were a number of great disappointments—it was sort of another area where as a girl you would feel different. There were opportunities that just were closed to you. There were certain plants you couldn’t go visit. I remember my parents were great ones to put us in a car and go somewhere and we’d do car camping and then we’d go tour something interesting. We’d try get into paper mills or go on to ocean liners or things like that. We couldn’t go through a lot of factories—girls, my mom and I couldn’t go. My dad and my brother could go but girls and women were not allowed, it was too dangerous. What? You have to be kidding me. It was just really odd.\\n00:58:10\\nAW: Did your mom and you ever talk about that as you were growing up?\\nLC: We would sort of just look at each other. My mom would acknowledge it, and she’d just go, “It’s just not right. It’s just not right.” But she got it. She was concerned with justice and she got it. I always thought, Why do you live here? Why? I don’t get it.\\nAW: Why did they live in Barron? Were they born there or where did they come from?\\nLC: Well, they were both from little towns. My mom, she had taught at the University of Minnesota for a year. I don’t think my dad wanted to live there; he was no city person at all. He wanted to live in a little town. I think it was really important to him to live close to nature. I think he would have been happy living kind of like how I live. He did a lot of different things for a living, but he was a map drawer but he was also a fur trapper and a hunter. That was part of our family’s income, so he couldn’t really do that in a city. But he was outside a lot of the time. He A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n12\\nreally was able to kind of do what he liked doing—being outside a lot. My mother, through her family, she inherited a little tiny business, which people don’t have any more—it’s like when you buy a piece of property or a house, you get an abstract which shows a history of the land. So my dad would draw all the maps and then he had a printing press and then he would draw the maps and then transfer them to a plate and make these maps. That was really interesting to me. Kind of like the creamery butter makers, I loved being with him because I could watch him make the maps and then get the plate ready, put it on the press. He could hear when the press—when something was wrong he could hear it and he’d tinker with it. It was a pretty big press by today’s standards. It was really a beautiful process. He could draw with both hands; he could make a beautiful line. So beautiful to watch him draw. It was really great, so I spent a lot of time watching him draw and then he taught me how to draw with his tools. I have his tools and I don’t draw that way at all now but I love trying. It’s a very obscure way to draw with pen and ink. He used these beautiful tools that were basically two pieces of steel that had a little channel in them and there was a little screw with a thumbscrew and you could adjust the width of the line with this little thumbscrew and you’d dip it into ink, and you were sort of right or wrong. Over time you develop a skill, which is to very decisively make a line with a certain width. You develop a touch for it where you have a sense of conviction that you’re going to be successful making this line, and you develop an ability to make a beautiful line with conviction. It’s the same kind of skill that you have to have if you play music or if you’re a surgeon, or whatever your practice is, if you’re a writer—if you do something daily over time, it’s your practice—you develop a sense of touch with your material. My father had that with pen and ink and the line. It was a beautiful thing, very beautiful thing, and I loved that about his skill. That was really important to me to see someone who had a daily practice, didn’t matter what it was, but those were the people I paid attention to as a kid. I’m kind of putting it together now, thank you: the butter maker, the guy with the shovel and the coal, my dad with his pen and ink, my mom in a justice kind of way, daily practice of justice. Those were the people that I paid attention to. Those were my role models, those people that did something with conviction. I think that’s probably all I was looking for was a way to have a daily practice with conviction, with aesthetics and using my hands and moving through the landscape with a purpose. I think that’s it. That’s kind of it in a nutshell; that’s sort of all I ever wanted to do. And have great meaning to some of it, or enough meaning to make it worth getting up in the morning and wanting to keep doing it. That’s all I’ve ever wanted in my life.\\n01:05:03\\nThe other thing I think I probably got from my dad—I think I talked about observation and being a detective. I guess because my dad was a fur trapper, it was fascinating to me as a child—I would go with my father on his trap line. It was sort of like having dairy cows where you have to attend to them twice a day. You attend to them, or you don’t do that activity. He would basically go on a hike twice a day, and basically his job was to observe what’s going on—who’s walking where (in terms of the animals)? Who’s walking where, how are they living, what are they doing, where are they moving? Basically he would try to trick them with their materials and his trap. That was basically what he was doing. He would set a trap by observing where to put it; he would try to trick them and then he would check the traps and find out if he was right or wrong. Obviously, when he was right he would harvest them and take them home and process them in a certain way and then sell them and get money for them. That was basically my college money, or A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n13\\na lot of my college money was from that. He actually gave me a sock full of money with all the money I had earned with my trap line. That’s another story, but it was interesting through observation and physical activity—which was a beautiful activity, going on a hike with snowshoe or ski with a pack and equipment and setting up a situation, and being right or wrong. It didn’t matter if you were wrong because the hike was beautiful. Through time, repetition, going to the same place over time, observation—to me, that was so important in my childhood: observing the same thing over and over as the seasons change. It really gave me a love of being outdoors and moving. When people ask me why I live where I live, I could never really figure it out. Now I think I figured it out—basically I re-created an environment where I am able to work here, I’m able to isolate myself where I can have a daily practice with very few distractions. It’s kind of a base camp where I can come and go. Obviously I can go for work and travel, but basically I can be reclusive in my studio and I’m happy. Happy is a funny word but I set up an opportunity where I can get something done and not be distracted. And yet I have a whole world, or I can hike and ski and canoe even in the spring in a place where I have a daily rhythm to being outside. I probably didn’t say that very well, but I’m able to be outside moving in the landscape and I don’t have to drive anywhere. I can just go out my door. I really enjoy that. I’ve been able to recreate that part of my childhood here. It’s really odd when I see it that way but I think that’s part of why I settled here. Obviously it was cheap land too; it was inexpensive—that was part of it too. I can have a wood kiln here and make a big fire and have smoke and nobody can find me. That’s part of it too.\\n01:10:24\\nAW: What were your parents’ names?\\nLC: My dad’s name was Glenn, and my mother’s name was Elizabeth—though she went by Betty.\\nAW: You said they were from small towns in the Midwest or Wisconsin?\\nLC: Wisconsin.\\nAW: So they were both from Wisconsin. What is your brother’s name?\\nLC: Peter. My dad came from a Norwegian family and his parents never spoke English. I’m pretty sure he was very ashamed of his family in that way. I think he was the only person in his siblings to go to college. I think he worked very, very hard to get away from that culture of not being able to read and write. He really did an astounding thing in his family and I’m only really able to see that now. My brother and I talk about it that it was really remarkable. My mother came from a family of lawyers and judges, and she did an astounding thing by marrying someone of a lower class who she recognized as an intellectual match and a very kind person who was able to get her out of doors, which was something her family didn’t do. They were really remarkable people in that they were able to find what they needed in each other. I don’t think I realized that as a child, but as an adult, of course, we look back and see these things. But they ended up in a small town and it’s kind of too bad in a way; I think my mother ended up living close to her family, so she was probably a little restrained in her life. I think she was A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n14\\nsomeone who was depressed, I think, her life, and my father was a sort of happy go lucky and content, he had great peace of mind. My mother, I think she was clinically depressed. My father was great for her to be around, but she was someone who never shined and she was really brilliant. She did really great things in many ways but I think given a different circumstance I think she would have—I don’t know what she would have done but she could have been a writer, or she could have been like someone like Madeline Albright. She could have worked in an international relations kind of way either through a non-profit or a government sort of way. Very progressive person.\\nAW: You said she also was college educated. What was her major?\\nLC: She took a Home Ec. degree, and I think that’s sort of what people did back then, what girls, young women did. She never really worked in Home Ec. She taught for a little while. She taught in the School of Nursing at the University of Minnesota. I think she taught nutrition. She wasn’t happy doing that. She didn’t want to be a nutritionist or teach nutrition, she didn’t want to teach Home Ec. My father had been trained to teach shop—woodshop. You learn tools and that is what he was trained to teach. They went to a place called Stout State in Menominee.\\n01:15:35\\nAW: Is that were they met?\\nLC: Yeah, that’s where they met. My mom played the string bass and my dad asked her if he could help her carry it. She was like six foot tall and skinny and she could carry it just fine, but that’s how they met.\\nTM: Did she teach herself bass?\\nLC: No, she learned in high school. She learned starting in grade school, but she never really pursued it. I never heard her play. I never would have considered her a musician per se, but she insisted that both my brother and I take piano so we each grew up playing the piano from a young age.\\nAW: Do you still play piano?\\nLC: I play a little bit but I wouldn’t say I have a daily practice.\\nAW: You were talking about her work to bring speakers to the town. You said she tried to get the Berrigan brothers to come. Did they come through?\\nLC: They didn’t come, but there were two other priests who came.\\nAW: Do you remember who they were?\\nLC: They were well known people. Not as well known as the Berrigan brothers but I could probably find out their names. I couldn’t tell you offhand, but they would be recognizable names A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n15\\nfor scholars of that time period or activists of that time period would know who they were. I think they were from Vermont. They would go around to colleges and speak. My brother was also really interesting in his background because he—we have basically the same issues from our family, like everyone does, and our childhood but from our small town—he, as a sophomore in college, he was very upset—I hope I get the story right—but he was upset about some remarks the president of University of Wisconsin-Madison—that’s where he went to school—the university president had made a comment during a public talk about the anti-war movement and the students at Madison—he made a statement that my brother found was provocative or disagreeable. So he made an appointment to talk to the president and interview him on this point because he was a journalism major. Through that chance event he would meet with the president every so often and they would discuss things. It grew into—well, the president and his wife live in a mansion and they need someone who always is present there and lives there, and it usually is a student. They asked my brother if he would want to do that. He actually moved into their house—they had an apartment for a caretaker. He lived there for a lot of his school years. He went to graduate school and lived there and he went to law school and he lived there. He was older than me and I didn’t quite get at the time what a remarkable thing this was about my brother. He also followed a hunch. He was like a detective, too, in a certain way. He would follow a hunch and it would lead somewhere really fascinating and interesting. Like my father, and my mother, he was very good with people and finding great things, finding great meaning through interesting people, and following a trail of clues. In a way that’s sort of what I do but with visual—it’s a visual problem, or a visual opportunity with material and tools. But it’s basically kind of the same thing, I think of it as kind of the same thing. An opportunity, setting up a problem with restrictions, seeing what’s going on, and then coming up with a hypothesis or something that you’re really interested in and following it. My brother sort of does the same thing, sort of what my dad did, it’s sort of what my mom did, but my visual way was just something I couldn’t help myself with. I couldn’t see anything better, I guess.\\n01:22:02\\nAW: Let’s talk about that more. What were some of your early experiences with art? You said you had taken a drawing class. When did you first get into ceramics? Or were there other artistic passions that you had?\\nLC: As a kid, I always made things; I mean, I always made things. It was just what I did as a kid. What I really remember is either being outside, just sitting on the ground, just playing with sticks and stones. Just training to rearrange them—given this, two sticks and a stone, make something out of it. This sounds weird, but—I don’t think my parents were cruel—but I was a kid that just took off, so I actually had a little harness and I was actually on a little thing by a tree. I don’t have a lot of memories about it, but I’m starting to remember some things about it. Honestly, I could just sit there with three sticks and a stone, and, Wow, this is great. Just make the best of it. So arranging things. Again—they were not cruel to me but I took off, I guess. I’m sort of remembering more of that, just sitting there, unable to run but unable to figure out how to get out of it—I wasn’t quite Houdini. (Laughs) But that was enough to occupy myself; that was plenty. As a kid I remember when my grandmother was in and out of hospitals and my mom would take me and then she would just sort of park me somewhere with paper and pencil and coloring books. I remember being under stairs—I would always go under stairs somewhere by a window A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n16\\nwhere I could sit and draw. I thought that was really great. I just liked doing that. I would sort of venture around to the kitchens where they would have the hospital kitchens and I would sort of get to know the cooks and then I would sit in the kitchen sometimes; I would draw the kitchen. When I think about it now, I would probably sit in the employee lunchroom or I would sit on the floor and watch the people cook. That was fascinating too, so I was sort of drawing whatever was there. So basically being alone, finding—through observation—on my own I found a purpose, it was meaningful to me, I found something that was engaging, aesthetically. I wouldn’t say necessarily that I was good at this or say I had great skill. I wouldn’t say I was talented in anyway whatsoever but, I really liked doing it. It was just fine by me to be by myself under the stairs, tied up to a tree, it was great. I was fine. No problem. (Laughs) But again—they were not being cruel at all. I would not see it that way. I was like the kid, if we would go to a store somewhere in a big city, I was off and running and lost and enjoying it. I think it came from that. Just trying to keep me safe, really. I feel like I’m defending them now, I should defend them.\\n01:27:10\\nAW: It sounds like you like to explore on your own so I could understand that your mom wanted to see you at all times.\\nLC: I did run everywhere. I never walked as a kid; I always ran, I always ran.\\nAW: So were there art opportunities at your school that you could take?\\nLC: Not really. I have to think back to it. I remember being really frustrated in, like, kindergarten: it was like I was so excited that you could draw and have real paint and all that and I guess I was never the kid that would like to draw the turkey with your fingers and here’s the colors. I wouldn’t say I got reprimanded for it but I always felt that it wasn’t quite right. I would always look for the other opportunities like architectural drawing, industrial arts—that’s what my father was trained to teach: industrial arts. But I really liked industrial arts because you could cut things up free form, even though you were supposed to make a shoe shine kit or a duck or something, I liked industrial arts a lot. I did take every art class you could take and I remember the first art class—sculpture was being given a bar of ivory soap and you could carve it. That’s what sculpture was. I was like, Really? I mean I probably made sculpture as a child, that’s probably what it was. I think all kids—I don’t know if you’d call it art—but all kids play with material and in other cultures it would be called art, or some cultures would call it art. But all children probably rearrange natural materials and play with color and line. It just seemed like art class wasn’t what I thought it would be. When I took the first drawing class—it really wasn’t a class, but it was when we drew in art class. I think in high school you could finally take a class where you could draw. I just thought, Wow, this is great. This is fantastic! Not that I was good at it—I was not good at it—but the fact that the teacher—I’ll never forget it—he set up a still life with a box of matches and a candle and I was like, Wow, this is really great. I could do this forever. I was in heaven. I just thought it was, Wow, and then, Wow, maybe he could help me draw better.\\n01:30:59\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n17\\nThe idea that you could have an art teacher—I just found that so optimistic. I was just thrilled that somebody could actually help me. I just could hardly stand it, the idea of it, almost. Our art teacher was Mr. Muller and he taught art—I don’t think we ever had it in grade school—but in junior high. I never got it in junior high because girls had to take Home Ec. The boys could take art or industrial arts and the girls could take Home Ec. and Industrial Arts. I don’t think I could take art in junior high, so high school was a time when I could take it as an elective. I was taking advanced writing and chemistry. I always did well in school and school was easy for me so I always took advanced classes and it suddenly occurred to me that, Oh, I should take art, when I was a senior. I dropped out of the advanced classes and signed up for this art class. Oh my god, I can hardly believe it. The teacher, bless his heart, he was a wildlife artist, a duck artist. His forte was drawing ducks and geese and the swamp kind of landscape. Maybe he became a duck stamp artist—he would be that kind of person, working with charcoal and watercolor and pencil. He was really good at it in a certain style. I don’t know that he really was a great artist or a great teacher. I don’t feel like he really helped me much. When I think of an art teacher now I think of somebody who can really help you grow. That’s a little bit of the college teaching I do and have done. My goal is to help people learn skills obviously but also to help them grow in their vision—help them grow as fast as you can. I don’t feel like he had that part of him, which was too bad because I was so moldable and eager. But I was happy to just try and be there in the class. I really had a love for drawing. The fact that somebody legitimized it, you know, that is a valid thing—this isn’t just a quirky thing that I do because that’s what I do. It was really nice to have it legitimized. He had in the back room a potter’s wheel, which was like a record player—it was on or off. It had a little switch and it sat on a table. I think it was made by a company called Amaco. It was a little metal—like a record player. He had a bag of clay and he didn’t know how to use it and we never did use it. So I took the bag of clay out one time and I got it out and I put it on the wheel and I put some water on it—it seemed too dry—and I turned it on and immediately couldn’t do it. I thought, Wow, this must be really hard. This is impossible—how do people do this? It just didn’t make any sense to me. That was sort of my beginning to think about, Wow, I could make a pot. I did try.\\nMy other paying attention to pots was from growing up—we didn’t have any handmade things in our home that were pottery. We didn’t have pots at all. We had a couple paintings. We had clothing, obviously, that my mother made. My father was a knitter so we had some things he had knit. He knit stocking caps; basically, that was his forte. My mother knitted Norwegian patterned socks and things like that. So we did have some handmade things but no real art. Not much of that around. We had a lot of books, a lot of books. So that was important—books, you know, which were handmade—someone handmade a book. We had a lot of music, that’s handmade. But in terms of visual art, not so much. But I started collecting a few pottery things, kind of oddly, in seventh grade, maybe. I would get them at dumps, you know, farm dumps, I would get pieces.\\nWe always had crocks around, through pickling, but they weren’t considered art or anything. I sort of got interested in canning jars, and I started collecting ceramic canning jars, in seventh grade, I think. I also bought a pump organ at a farm auction at the same farm auction that I started getting these canning jars at. These canning jars were thrown in a mold and then they had a screw top lid made out of zinc, and I just thought that was really beautiful, the zinc on the screw top. I just thought they were really beautiful. I liked the idea that—it really interested me that it was a metal lid on a piece of ceramics. That really was a wild idea to me; it was a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n18\\nrevolutionary idea. It’s really not that revolutionary because I had been using them with glass, a glass canning jar with a screw top lid. That’s what people used. After the screw top lid came the rubber ring and the little flat dome and then the separate screw ring. But this was the lid and ring as one, and it was a beautiful thing. So I recognized that in seventh grade—that this is a pot with a utilitarian purpose that is actually beautiful in a way that sets up attention—this zinc lid and this beautiful mechanically made pot with some odd little hand touches in the stenciling and the denting of the lid where the hand touches the mechanical. I thought, Wow, this is beautiful. But I couldn’t have diagnosed it, or visually taken it apart at that point as a child. I couldn’t have told you why it was beautiful like I can critically take it apart now and analyze it. I could write a thesis on it. I could write a paper on that one pot. That was sort of a revolution for me in my thinking about or considering pottery as something other than a utilitarian object. It had an aesthetic power and mystery all on its own.\\n01:40:05\\nI still have that canning jar, actually. I don’t have a lot of things from my childhood. I have my skis that I grew up with and they are some of the most beautiful things. My dad actually made them for me. They’re so beautiful. He made them from a nail barrel and he painted them yellow. They’re so beautiful. They’re the kind of thing if I saw at an auction that I would try and get them. But the fact that he made them, they’re beautiful, they’re functional, and I learned to ski on them. My brother learned, and my daughter learned—a lot of kids learned to ski on them.\\nAW: The same skis?\\nLC: The same skis. They’re so beautiful. It’s the aesthetically pleasing object that is a tool, a tool in the way that it’s useful. It’s got everything you want visually, aesthetically, and as a tool, or utilitarian object. It’s got it all.\\nAW: When did you get a chance to take a pottery class?\\nLC: Not till college really and I just kind of stumbled on it. I was an art major and a music major at the same time. I had to pick and I kind of liked them both equally, but I picked art because I had performance anxiety and I was really shy. As a person I was very shy and easily intimidated. It was just really hard for me to perform. It was really hard. Nowadays you can take classes in it, take drugs for it, and get help with it. But it just never occurred to me to ask for help. I picked art. I thought, Great, I’ll never ever have to do anything in public. This is great! That’s what I thought. It’s really funny now looking back. It’s funny that I would think that, but that’s really what I thought: I can hide, basically, great. It never occurred to me to take ceramics. It never would have occurred to me. But when I was taking requirements the last requirement I had to take—before you had to specialize—I had to choose between printmaking or ceramics. The printmaking teacher—I was just terrified of him. He had a temper, he was very short, and he looked like Hitler—or the pictures of Hitler that I had seen—and people behind his back, rather cruelly, referred to him as “Little Hitler.” I was terrified of him and I was like, Gosh, there’s no way I’m going to take a class from him, even though I’d never met him but I had seen him around, and people’s stories. I just was like, Hm-mmm, no way. In hindsight? Wow, I would have loved printmaking, in hindsight. I think I would have just loved it. The fact that you could A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n19\\ntake drawing—what’s drawing? Making a line. Take some lines, assemble the lines in a certain way, make the lines in a very unusual way with these unusual tools on a plate. Oh my god, I would have loved it. Lithography, I think I would have loved lithography. It’s not too late. (Laughs) I could still love it. But to develop touch and a daily discipline, well, it’s probably too late with me for that. But I really think lithography—I love that litho crayon—I think it’s called a crayon, I’m out of my element but the big stone, the litho stone, and the motion with the crayon. I love making a line, in general, and I think of pottery as three-dimensional making of a line. I know that sounds odd, but it’s making a line in a certain way with a certain tool. I think the litho stone—I think it’s called a stone—but I think I would love to make a line with the litho crayon and the litho stone. I think I would love that. I probably should do that. I should write a grant and do that, but I don’t have a touch for it, and I’m naïve, I don’t know a thing about it.\\n01:45:52\\nOh, so I didn’t do the printmaking—too bad really, as an aside—so I took ceramics. I just signed up for the class. I made some great friends there. I made some lifelong friends there. One of my best friends ever is a photographer and I met her in that class. I just re-met a fellow, who just took a class from me, I just re-met one of my old classmates from one of my first ceramics classes. I just had no idea what to expect and I just showed up. I bought the little tools that you buy. I bought the textbook—there was only one book you could buy and I bought that little book and showed up. I was that kid that just couldn’t get it. I just couldn’t get it. The teacher would demonstrate and, “Here’s how you do it,” and it looked so easy. I just thought, Oh my god. This is going to be great! Because I touched the clay and it was like, This is so good! Oh god, I can’t believe how good this feels. Wow, it’s so plastic. It just felt right. It just felt so luscious and oh, it just had these great qualities. You roll it in your hand and make a little snake and, Oh, my god, it just felt so good. Then I’d get it on the wheel and it was just like, Oh, shit, this is horrible. I can’t do this! Oh god. And I’m that kid that was like: just keep at it, keep at it, keep at it, keep at it. Above anything I’m persistent, so I just kept at it. Basically I’m still that kid, just keeping at it. None of it comes easy for me. I don’t know, maybe there’s just something about it—I still have that sense of wonder or that tactile thing. I still have that love of how it feels. That’s not enough to sustain your interest or your career or your problem-solving or your intellect, but I recognize that I still have those little moments of, Oh my god, this feels so good and so right. But I was the bumbling, unskilled—it was just really, really frustrating.\\nLC: It was just really hard. I was so lucky in so many ways for all of us in general—being in the right place at the right time with the right people—I felt like I was just out of this world lucky. The first teacher I had—it was unbelievable. The teacher we were supposed to have got arrested for making LSD. He and one other person got arrested, and they got hauled away to federal prison. The school didn’t know what to do; it was like school was ready to start and they didn’t have a teacher so they pulled one of the best students from the University of Minnesota who happened to be this guy Mark Pharis, who’s really an incredible potter. He was a student at the time. He was just a few years older than me. So they brought him in, so he left school—he never went back to school and he’s been a dean at the University of Minnesota. It’s really great. No, he never got his undergraduate degree. He’s been a terrific teacher and a terrific potter, and a dean at the U of M. It’s just so great. So they brought him in and he didn’t have a studio of his own so A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n20\\nhe would work at night. When he wasn’t teaching he would work in our classroom. That was fantastic.\\n01:50:32\\nSo even though I was bumbling and couldn’t get it, I watched a lot. It didn’t occur to me to ask for help. I was pretty shy and I had long hair and I just kind of kept my head down and kept trying. I didn’t ask for help, really. So I was slow to pick up any skills. I just bumbled. I always got A’s probably because I tried so hard. As a teacher, how do you grade students who work really hard, try really hard, they’re in there all the time but they can’t get it? If they’re a football player and they can’t throw the ball, or if they’re a violinist and they can’t pull the bow across the string—it’s really not different than putting your hands on the clay on the wheel or making a slab. I don’t know, I had teachers who must have been kind to me because I always got A’s, but I was a bumbler. Bumble, bumble. I don’t know why I kept at it because it was so hard. I guess because I could see hope. I had hope because I kind of saw the politics of it. I saw what a pot could do. I saw that it could be a useful object or tool that could stand on its own as a visual object. It could hold a sense of visual weight that was as interesting or as compelling as, say, a painting or a drawing. It was a three-dimensional drawing, to me, or that’s how I came to see my interest. It was drawing in 3D on a material that was plastic and engaging in a tactile way. But then it would become hard and it would become something else that had the potential to be both useful and beautiful and have a visual tension that is somehow compelling to me—maybe not to others, but to me. It was a worthwhile effort even if I wasn’t good at it. I could see maybe it was worth keeping on. I never set out to be a potter or have a career in it, but I never saw a reason to stop. I never was so hopeless or found anything that was as meaningful that I would want to quit. I basically always found a way to keep doing it. That was sort of my modus—just keep at it until you’re either beat down by it—I don’t mean that in a bad way but because it was so hard for me, it was evident that I could get beat down by it, or it would lose its sense of purpose, or I would find something that felt more important to me to do. I’m not sure what “important” would really mean.\\nI did also have a nagging—I don’t know what you would call it—but maybe this is where my sense of justice?—maybe justice is the wrong word, but I felt that pottery wasn’t important in the way that say political art would have. I would look at a lot of prints by someone like Goya who would make prints about a war or people who were war correspondents and took photographs of battle, or did drawings about war, or made visual work—a film, a photograph, a drawing, a print—that actually was not just a tool or something beautiful but it was something that would change the world. It was like pottery changing the world. The teacher that I had, Mark Pharis, and some of his friends, Wayne Branum—they really thought that pots could change the world, and the whole hippie thing going on—I was sort of a hippie—you know, it was like you change the world through your politics. There’s a lot to criticize about it and laugh at it about it, but basically the idea that you could change the world through your behavior or your personal politics could actually change the world. I bought in to that to a certain degree, but, in terms of aesthetics, for many, many years, I always had this thought—this nagging thing—it’s really not enough, it’s not enough just to make a cup. You should be changing the world or stopping a war or fighting for the rights of this class of people. It was sort of hard to make a case for a cup having that sort of intellectual weight. Go to court—can you make a logical case and show the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n21\\nevidence that a cup will change the world? This is a true statement—a cup will change the world. I actually came around to seeing that a cup has the capacity to change someone’s world. Making a cup has the capacity to change my world, my world of aesthetics and daily practice, the touch of the material, my sense of opportunity within the material. A cup has the capacity to be enough. But I also have some other interests and other materials, and I also work with other materials and I don’t have to work all my aesthetic problems with ceramics or pottery. I have other visual problems and opportunities that I‘m interested in that has nothing to do with pottery. That was a relief to accept that about myself that pottery is enough but I also have some other interests and other materials which I work with. I do not have a daily practice with those materials like I do with ceramics, so I’m not naïve that that other work is as developed or ever could be as developed as say my ceramic work is. We need to touch things every day or nearly every day to have a sense of touch and confidence with a material. But I did come around to seeing that a pot has a certain weight which is important in a certain way. It’s restrictive in many, many ways, and once I came to accept those restrictions there’s a universe of opportunity. That was a relief to me to be able to figure that out but of course that takes a long time and as a student and then I went on to do some graduate work after that—that really nagged at me because some of my friends were doing important art with printmaking and photography. I always felt sheepish, Oh, it’s just a pot, it’s just a cup, it’s just a plate, it’s just a bowl—you know you could live your whole life like that—I’m just a girl, I come from a little town—it just fit into that same thing for me. [Interview Break]\\n02:00:51\\nAW: Before we took a break, you were telling us about being in a pottery class and reflecting on pottery as changing the world. If we could back up a little bit—when you finished high school, when was that?\\nLC: 1970.\\nAW: You were reflecting earlier that you just wanted to get out of Barron, Wisconsin. Tell us what was your thought process then about where you wanted to go? What you wanted to do?\\nLC: I remembered being pretty scared. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t really know where to go. It was pretty different then. You couldn’t go online to look at colleges. Through my church, our church offered scholarships to two schools, you could go to Hamline or you could go to Lawrence University in Appleton. I thought I should go to Hamline because it seemed more exotic because it was in a different state, though it turned out to be closer to my hometown than Appleton was. I didn’t do my research. (Laughs) But that’s sort of what I thought: I’ll go to one of those. Or I could have gone to Madison but I didn’t want to do that because my brother was there. I auditioned for a music scholarship, I remember doing that. The Methodist church, because Hamline was associated with the Methodist church, you could get a scholarship through there. It seemed like the thing to do not really knowing much about anything. I just remember being really scared, excited but scared, super scared and very shy. I walked into my dorm room—when my parents said goodbye to me, my dad gave me a wool sock with this money in—my dad had a trap line and I helped him but then I had my own trap line. He took all the money and put it in a sock and gave it to me for school, for college. I remember standing holding this A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n22\\nwool sock full of money, which is really kind of weird, looking at my dorm mate’s dresser—I hadn’t met her yet, she’d moved in—and on her dresser was a big fancy makeup mirror with lights and she had these trays, it was like a gallery of cosmetics. I didn’t know what any of it was. I remember looking at my bag and then at this tray of cosmetics and I thought, Oh, what am I in for? I don’t know what I’m doing! I just felt so out of place. I was so excited and then I was like, I don’t know about this. It was pretty scary. It ended up I had a great roommate. I just saw her, last month. We just came from such different places. That’s what college is all about, really, navigating through life where everything is different from what you know, which is how it is supposed to be. She was perfect.\\n02:04:45\\nAW: What were your first impressions of St. Paul?\\nLC: It seemed awfully big. It seemed noisy. It seemed really exciting. I didn’t know this at the time—I’m somebody who is too easily stimulated. I have a hard time shutting my brain off. Falling asleep can be hard. I didn’t know that about myself that I really need quiet. I’m just really overly stimulated visually. It was very exciting and I had a hard time sleeping. Once I got that figured out, it was great. I loved going to museums and going to hear music. I wasn’t really a bar person. I wasn’t too interested in that kind of thing. I remember I met—Patti Smith came to our college and I just saw a poster and here’s a picture of Patti Smith—I didn’t know who she was—I just showed up. Nobody I knew would go and I just showed up and I remember there were like ten people in the room with Patti Smith. She was reading her poetry and singing a little. I think my jaw just dropped. I was like, Wow, this is so great. Patti Smith! I had never heard of her. That was incredible. Things like that were great—really great music and theater and dance. That was really fantastic. I loved the whole intellectual life. I really liked that. I didn’t like the dorm life so much; even then I was a solitary person. I read this description on a book jacket for the Annie Dillard wrote, on the back of the book where it has a little thing about the author, and it says, “Annie Dillard,” and then it said, “gregarious recluse.” I thought, Oh, that’s me. I’m a gregarious recluse. I love people when I’m with them but I am inclined to be on my own.\\nSo it was hard living in a dorm. Plus I couldn’t go outside that much. That was really weird. That part I found really hard, you know, being a young woman and you couldn’t walk around at night. I never felt safe and people would tell you not to. During the day it was not such a thing. People hitchhiked all the time, so I hitchhiked. I hitchhiked by myself, that was fine, but never at night. But I felt like I sort of had good street smarts on my own, I don’t know why. I guess just from observing nature, I observe people in the same way I would observe nature. When I would go out for a walk or go somewhere on a bus, I was somebody that could quickly suss out if something seemed kind of dicey or threatening. When an animal is threatened, an animal emits a certain look or energy—it’s like my radar was attuned to be aware of what’s around me. It wasn’t all that hard.\\nBehind the ceramics studio there was a big hill. There was a track, like an athletic track, but then there was a big hill. Down at the bottom of the hill was the East West Railroad tracks. Big, lot of railroad tracks. By the railroad tracks was a factory. It was called Koppers, I think that’s with a K. K-o-p-p-e-r-s Coke, C-o-k-e. It was a plant where it operated twenty-four hours a day. I think A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n23\\nthey burned coal in an atmosphere that didn’t have enough oxygen. It is coke that is used to make steel. It was this plant that ran twenty-four hours a day. It became my creamery. I would go there at night and watch, and it was just fantastic, it was so beautiful. There were these kilns or ovens. I don’t know what temperature it was, but it must have been over two thousand degrees. A door would open and this molten coke would get pushed out into a railroad car and the railroad car was pulled by a locomotive and the locomotive would pull ahead at the proper rate so the car would be filled up with this orange white hot coke. So at night it was fantastic to watch. It was so beautiful. It would drive to a big shed and they would have big hoses full of water would cool it down so that these big white clouds—and with the light from the city—it was just so beautiful. It was timed. You could time it on your watch. I went back later on and took a photo class and I made a little documentary on the plant and the workers. I really liked that kind of observation, kind of like being a sociologist, documentarian. I really liked that kind of project. Sometimes I feel like I could have chosen things a little differently and I could have gone into that kind of work, like photojournalism, or photographer, or sociologist.\\n02:11:40\\nLC: Yeah, I liked having something between me and what I was looking at. That something was a frame. I realized I really liked that and that I’ve always loved framing things. It’s my nature to always make a frame either kind of with my hand or I see a frame that that’s part of how I see. I’m not someone who is constantly scanning. People see in different ways, and I realized that when I started using a camera that that’s what I liked about it. That was kind of shocking and neat in a similar way. And I like the gadgetry about it. I liked the developing and I liked the smell of the developer and the fixer. I liked being in the dark room. I liked the process. It was really nice. I didn’t feel like I had a very good handle on the technical part, though, and to take photography at our school it was all through independent study. I really needed to do a lot of testing and I needed to find a method so I could test and get good contrast. At that time people learned something called the zone system, but I didn’t know what that meant. I never could get a print that I thought was decent that had good contrast. I couldn’t get a full black and a real white white and everything in between. I had a lot of white and a lot of grey but not real black black. I was just sort of muddling around and I could see that I needed some real instruction in it and I couldn’t get it at my school, so I gave up on the instruction part.\\nI did continue with photography by photographing my work. Most artists have to do their own documentation whether you’re a drawer or a painter—you have to photograph your work for catalogs and applying for grants. When I got out of my undergraduate, or I guess even at Hamline, I was starting to learn on my own how to document my pots and drawings. I’ve kept that up all these years through all the changes of equipment and switched over to digital. I’m not quite up to speed with it. I used to teach at the college level how to photograph your work with film in a camera, but I could never teach digital documentation; I feel like I’m way over my head. But I’m getting better at it. I’ve kept up that part of photographing and I do really enjoy photographing my work once I’ve given myself over to it. I really like trying to frame it and capture the best view. I really like that as a problem. I really enjoy it. I have enjoyed teaching it, as well. I’ve enjoyed passing that along to students because it’s one of those things that, if you don’t learn how to do it, it costs a lot of money to do. And you have to do it. You just have to do it to get your work out there and apply for grants and be in catalogs and exhibits. It’s sort of a A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n24\\nskill that you can’t avoid. Someone gave me the camera of my dreams a few years ago. It’s a four by five format press camera. It’s the kind of camera that someone like Margaret Bourke-White would have used, that made all those beautiful photographs in the Forties. It’s got a bellows in the front and you put a little black hood on. The film is in a plate. It’s like, Oh, you can hardly buy the film now and it would cost too much to use it but it’s like, Oh, I have this beautiful camera now. It’s hard.\\n02:16:35\\nAW: Have you used it with certain things?\\nLC: Oh, I’ve played with it. I’ve set up things, but I haven’t bought any film. But I’ve gone through the motions. It’s fun. It feels like a real thing like the difference between a real old phone, a heavy phone with a rotary dial versus a cell phone. There’s something really physical about an old tool that works well.\\nAW: So you were at Hamline when you took that pottery class that Mark Pharis taught. What happened after that class?\\nLC: Yeah, he left right away. He was there just the one semester. The other thing that I felt lucky about—one was to have Mark there and to have him working in the studio and then to have his buddies, his pals—Wayne Branum is the one I remember most—would come into the studio. He was a serious pottery student as well. How do you find your people in college? Who do you hang out with? I just hung out at the studio all the time and those became my people. I felt so lucky that that first pottery class—so many of those people wanted to keep working at night and on the weekends. It was a really nice energy in the studio. I felt so lucky to have found a place where I really felt at home, even though I wasn’t very good at it. I loved being there and was so happy there. The other thing, we had a certain kind of pottery wheel. We learned on these old Leach style treadle wheels. It’s a sit down wheel and you kick with your foot. That’s what we learned on and that’s the kind of wheel I came around to settling on in my own work. That feels lucky to me that was my first real tool was that wheel. I feel so lucky that it is just the right tool for me. If you think about drawing—if you draw, you pick a pencil that’s really, really soft, or really, really hard, it could have a wide line, it could make a skinny line, but there’s are all these variables. When I think about a pottery wheel, it allows me to get a certain kind of line with a certain kind of speed of a wheel with a certain kind of motion with my hands. It’s like I found a way to make a line or mark on the material in a way that I connected with. It took a long time to figure that out but I feel lucky that I learned with a tool that I discovered it could make a line that I loved, which I found in hindsight is remarkable because I’ve tried all sorts of tools and wheels and this and that and to end up using what I learned on, to come around to that, is lucky, amazingly lucky to me.\\nAW: How did Mark teach ceramics? What were you learning in that class?\\nLC: It’s kind of hard to remember, actually. I was such a muddler and I know we had assignments and I don’t think I did very well. I can’t really remember too much about it. He was a harsh critic, and I remember feeling like I was way in over my head, but I don’t know that I A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n25\\ncould come up with assignments or too many memories other than trying to learn how to center. I found that really hard. It seems like I would sort of learn something and go, Oh yeah, this is great. Then I would come the next day and feel like I had lost it, so it felt like I was starting all over. But I had a lot of teachers after that. Hamline had the adjunct professor thing so we had lots of different teachers. I had Bob Toensing, I think, was the next person. He went on to teach at Anoka Ramsey. Bob was there for most of my time. I don’t remember much about the classes. I think you could only take two classes and then independent study, so most of my classes were independent study.\\n02:21:50\\nAW: When you were there observing Mark and his friends in the studio, what were you noticing about their approach to ceramics?\\nLC: It’s hard to conjure up—I could see the wheel in the room and Mark hunched over—I think it was all new to me and it was amazing to me. I just couldn’t fathom how you could take that lump of stuff and then kick your leg a little bit and it would grow taller and wider. It was just sort of a magic trick that I could not do very well (laughs) and they could. The other thing that we did—the students, we would get together and Mark and Wayne would hold a sale together of their work, like at somebody’s house or somebody’s studio. We’d go to their sale and pick up lots of pots. The other thing lucky that happened—this was just by happenstance really—through the University of Minnesota, Mark met Betty Woodman, who is a major American ceramic figure. Actually, though, Wayne Branum—I think Wayne met Betty and Mark met Betty through Wayne. Betty came and gave a demonstration at the University of Minnesota. Mark was at Hamline, so he took us over to the “U” to watch her demonstrate and that really blew me away. I just could not believe the way she could touch the clay. The clay, I remember, it was very, very soft and pliable. She would make pieces on the wheel and then cut them apart and lay them down on the table. It was a like a revolution to me that you weren’t just making a little bowl or a round little thing—you could actually treat it like fabric or wood or metal. You could construct something out of something that you had put a form to. Betty came to Hamline and gave, I think, the only artist lecture that I ever heard at Hamline. She was the only person that I ever watched someone give a slideshow of their own work. I never had one female teacher at Hamline, either, in the art department or any other department. I had not one. So Betty was the only person that I ever saw as an undergraduate in that kind of capacity. Today it is remarkable, really. I also think how lucky I was because I really had an emotional response—I connected with her work. It was very remarkable. I had never seen anything like it. I wouldn’t say that it helped me learn, but it was just seeing possibilities. I saw some possibilities and keep at it and see what happens kind of attitude—kind of Pollyanna, really. I’m kind of like Pollyanna: keep your chin up, you know.\\n02:26:10\\nAW: Seems like a good way to be.\\nLC: Yeah, well the other thing that happened then too is that we would take some of our work over to the U. They had a salt kiln—I can’t remember who it was that got us students in there—but we’d take our work from Hamline over to the University of Minnesota. We would sneak it A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n26\\ninto this kiln. I don’t know how we snuck it over there; it seems kind of impossible that you could actually do that, but it felt like that. I’m not sure if we snuck it or if it was a legitimate thing but we had a number of salt firings. That’s where I first got a glimmer of a kind of surface that I loved—a surface that I could put on my work. One of the things I struggled with besides the technical aspects of using your hands was, What kind of a surface would I put on my work? Most schools have sort of a standard palate of glazes that you use and they’re all mixed up and you use them. I had done a lot of experimenting but I couldn’t find anything that I really loved. I liked some of the qualities about the glazes we had, but I realized early on that I loved the clay by itself. It always felt like, by putting a glaze on, I was putting clothing on a body or something; it’s like I wanted to see the skin, the bones and the structure. I liked a transparent glaze because you could still see that but one that you couldn’t see through or a matte glaze or a crystalline glaze, it just felt like clothing, and I wanted to see the clay. I always had that sense—I couldn’t have verbalized it at that point—but it just didn’t feel right to me. It could feel right when it was still wet and full of life but it seemed to always go downhill after that and just get worse and worse. Out of the salt kiln, what people were trying to achieve, was what people call an orange peel. It’s a surface sort of like a peel on an orange; it’s sort of bumpy and a little fatty, kind of ripple-y. People were really after that. It did have an overall color or tone that was all the same. Everybody would want that and they were really after that, and I thought, Yeah, I should get that. I want that. But I never really felt like I liked it. The parts of the kiln that I ended up really loving were the parts that had been fired wrong—it was irregular, it didn’t get enough salt, and you’d turn the pot around and one side would have the orange peel that you were supposed to get and the other side would be not much on it, and there would be a little flash from the salt or the flame. I thought, Aha, now this is really interesting because I can still see the clay. I can still see it. And it seemed to make it more visible. It kind of made it better. I thought, Ah, that must be the purpose of a glaze is to make the form better, according to what better means to you. Everybody has to figure out what that means. When I saw those flaws and connected on some kind of level, I thought, Wow, there is something here for me. I made note of that.\\nWe moved our studio at Hamline across the road and I was one of the volunteers to help, and the teacher said, “We should build a salt kiln. Who will build it?” I raised my hand and nobody else did, so I ended up building a little salt kiln and tried to figure out how to get that irregular surface. I did get it in some places. It was a nice school because students were encouraged to help build kilns and learn how to weld and cut bricks and do the pipefitting—it was really good for me in that way—mixing clay; we learned how to do all those skills. I became the technician, you know—it’s like your student job to mix the clay and the glazes. That was good. You must be tired of hearing this stuff. (Laughs)\\n02:31:28\\nAW: No, no, this is good, keep going. It’s great this sense that you were trying something out in the salt kiln and then you get this piece back where you see, Oh, this can—that was something that spoke to you from that, what do you call it, the flaw firing?\\nLC: --Flaws, or faults.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n27\\nAW: Yeah, but it actually was an inspiring moment for you. Was that something that you tried to recreate?\\nLC: After that school I didn’t know what to do and I ended up getting a scholarship to go to art school in Canada. We had a teacher there who came in the summer and we built a wood fire kiln. That kiln, it was kind of the same thing—I discovered a surface from that kind of kiln that was a flaw that people weren’t after. It was a different kind of flaw, but it was a similar kind of discovery. When I eventually got out on my own, I couldn’t decide which of these directions to go with and I ended up going with both. That’s what I use today, I employ both of those flaws, or faults.\\nAW: What school in Canada were you in?\\nLC: It’s called the Banff Center School of Fine Arts.\\nAW: When you graduated from Hamline, what were you thinking at that point?\\nLC: Oh, I didn’t know what to do. I was terrified. I had no idea what to do. I wanted to keep working in ceramics but I didn’t know what to do. This school had a fifth year, which is basically you’re the technician in the studio and you can work in the studio. They called it an apprenticeship program. So I signed up for that and no one else signed up, so I got it, which was great. I got a couple of part time jobs to pay my apartment and food and then I could work as much as I wanted and do the work for the teacher, professor, you know, get some critical feedback and try to not think about the next year. (Laughs)\\nAW: When you graduated with an art major what was your parent’s response?\\nLC: They were worried. I remember my father said to me, “You should really get your teaching credentials so you can teach high school.” I just said to him, “Well, I’ll never teach. I don’t want to teach. I don’t know what I’ll do, but you’ve always told me to follow my passion and that’s just what I’ve done.” (Laughs) But, you know, they were concerned that I would have a hard time making a living, rightfully so, as any parent would be concerned.\\nAW: When you were at Hamline you said you met a few professional artists, like Mark and his friends, did you ever talk to them about what it was like to make ceramics a career?\\n02:35:15\\nLC: Well, most of them that I did meet taught; most of them had an academic life. Most of them didn’t have to make their livelihood from their work. I met mostly painters and people who drew, you know, through other classes. I didn’t really meet all that many ceramic people, just Betty Woodman, Mark. No other teacher brought in any professional potter or ceramicist to give us a lecture or a slideshow. I don’t think people did it as much as they do today. It was probably unusual; the whole visiting artist thing was probably not as widespread as it is now. I didn’t think ahead too much, which I think was good, actually. (Laughs) I was thinking about what is the next thing. I didn’t think too far down the line, but I did start worrying about the next year. I had seen A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n28\\na poster for this school in Banff, Alberta, Canada. I had taken a summer school there. I had gotten a scholarship. So I knew about the school. I saw another poster and it had a line drawing of the mountain and it said, “Ceramic Scholarship, Two-Year Residency.” I thought, Aha, this could be good. I was so lucky. I applied for that and I got a free ride. It was unbelievable. I had to get a little job to pay for a place to live and food but it was tuition free. It was a two-year program where you just worked, there was no instruction at all. Visiting artists would come and go. So that’s where I met some visiting artists. I don’t know that there were any women. There was one woman, Ann Mortimer, but it was mostly Canadian men, some American men, a couple of people from England, really interesting people. There were a couple of people who were really influential for me. There was a fellow named John Chalke who was a British potter who moved to Canada and he taught at the Alberta College of Art. He introduced me to a time period in ceramics that became really important to me, historically. Looking back at that time period I really connected with these pots and they were medieval pots from Portugal, Spain, France, England. That time period, it was the first group of historical pots that I had ever seen outside of a few pictures in a couple of books that I felt sort of a kinship with. It’s like discovering a photograph of your great-great grandfather or something. It’s like there’s some kind of connection at some basic level that you really don’t quite get what it is but there’s something there. He introduced all of us to some films that were great to see, some historical films. One of them was this old guy Isaac Button who had been a country earthenware potter in England. He was the last potter at this little factory, and he dug his own clay and did everything by hand. That made a big impression on me. It was like, Wow, I think I could want to be a potter. It just looked like such hard work. It looked brutal in a way that I liked, like that creamery or that coke plant. It just seemed kind of romantic in a kind of hard fought way. It seemed really attractive to me. It was a historical film, so of course you could never do that, but I liked seeing that a lot. We saw some old films from the Leach pottery in England where several of my friends had gone to train. I think in hindsight if I had known about the Leach pottery I might have gone, I might have tried to have gotten on there, but I didn’t know about it at that point. I didn’t like to be told what to do. I didn’t like something that had a real straight and narrow, right and wrong way of doing things. I had heard that there was a right way and wrong way, and I didn’t like that, it was sort of like adopting a religion. I always fought that kind of authority, in general, but again, in hindsight, it would have been really good for me. And man, I would love somebody to tell me what to do now. Tell me what to do, please! (Laughs). And from a skill point, I would have loved to have gone and had somebody actually show me step a, b, c, d, e, f, g. I would love it if I had those kind of skills because I just bumbled. I never had a teacher that showed skills or taught skills in that way. I‘m not sure where I got that idea of fighting—probably from those teachers I got that attitude that if you keep trying you’ll find it, which is a very naïve way of teaching. As a teacher I would never teach that way. I think maybe you can come to that after you’ve learned some skills. It’s the rare person who could become a folk artist or play jazz music without learning scales and how to play and get some instruction. Anyway, I would have benefited from some real training, I think, but I fought it too.\\n02:42:25\\nAW: During these two years of residency, how would you describe your work? What was your style?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n29\\nLC: Well, I was just searching. All along I kept searching. It’s hard to find your style when you have no real tradition behind you, you have nothing to break away from, don’t know where you’re at because you’re all over the place. I was kind of all over the place. In these schools you’re forced to use their materials and their glazes. I spent a lot of time experimenting to find things that felt like mine. It was like a quest, a quest to find out who I was in my work. It all seemed so intangible and faraway. The harder I tried to find it the further away it got. It just was very, very hard, even though my skills were getting better and I was reasonably competent at certain things. It seemed really difficult to figure it out. It seemed so intangible compared to my friends say who were photographers, or painters or printmakers, where they would go and look at something and try to capture it, or alter it, or combine elements to make something that was totally different, and it had some content that was definitely not a functional pot. It had another kind of content. So the intellectual stuff going along at the school didn’t seem to have a lot to do with a cup and a bowl. I found it wonderful and very hard at the same time. It was bittersweet. I just kept trying things, I kept trying things. I think when I left I had developed a body of work that I could exhibit, and I got a grant. I could pass myself off as having a modest amount of skill and a cohesive body of work that had some continuity, but I didn’t really feel all that great inside. I don’t know, it just didn’t feel great.\\nAW: Didn’t feel like you had found your clear voice with what you were making?\\nLC: Yeah, some people use that word voice. I did find a certain voice, I did have a certain style. I was doing these big large landscape plates. I was in this mountain landscape, which was overwhelming, so I was basically doing these mountain landscapes on these big plates. There was a skill to learn how to make these big plates so they don’t fall over and they don’t crack, how to layer the glazes. I was sort of being a painter on a plate; I was painting plates, really. It just wasn’t all that satisfying. With ceramics, the process is so long from making the form to glazing to firing and getting it out of the kiln. It’s not like making a drawing or a quick painting; the turnaround time is so slow. My pace was glacial; my change felt glacial compared to my friends who were photographers. One day they’re painting with oil, the next day they’re making a drawing, and then they’re making a photograph, printing on paper and folding it and stapling it. With ceramics, the tasks are so slow; you can’t really be all over the place like that. I left there feeling like I still wanted to keep going, but I didn’t feel like I really knew what I was doing. I didn’t feel like I was connecting in a way with my work that felt genuine. If I had to use adjectives to describe it compared to the work I make now, it would probably be described as very controlled, very tight—people have said it was Scandinavian in a way, rigid, calculated, cold. Now I would say my work is calculated, but the results probably wouldn’t be described as cold. But it still is calculated in a certain way. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing. You probably wouldn’t recognize it as my work. I wouldn’t recognize it as my work I guess.\\n02:48:44\\nAW: Did you keep any of these?\\nLC: I have a few things in the basement, yeah. I’m kind of scared to look at it. (Laughs)\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n30\\nAW: This is still the Banff Center School? Where did you head next? At that time did you participate in shows?\\nLC: As a student, yeah, you were in shows, exhibitions. There were a couple of juried exhibitions and that was the first time I had tried to get my work in a juried exhibition and was successful and was surprised. That felt good; it felt surprising too. I was going to mention there were two other people that were helpful to me. This fellow John Chalke was the person who came during the summer and we built a two-chambered wood kiln. He was just a great person for me to meet at that time. He was just so full of curiosity. He was a perfect person for me to run into. There was another fellow John Reeve who had worked at the Leach pottery and was a good friend of Warren MacKenzie, who I eventually met and who was very helpful to me later on in my career. John Reeve had worked at the Leach pottery so through watching him work, he came as a visiting artist, and he talked a lot about the Leach pottery. It was at that point that I realized, Oh, wow, too bad I hadn’t known about that. That was really wonderful. The director of the ceramic program, a guy named Les Manning, was very helpful to me as well. He taught me a few skills that I still use—these specific skills, and teach them to other people and say I got it from him because they’re so helpful and easy and I’m ever grateful to him for that. It’s a basic thing that everyone should learn that no one has shown you.\\nAW: What are the skills?\\nLC: How to make a slab, take a piece of clay and make a slab using nothing but a floor or a table. It has a thickness that’s consistent through the whole length and width of it. You don’t need a rolling pin or anything, just your hands. Hands, clay, and an absorbent surface. It’s really strong and it’s a beautiful technique.\\nAW: Why is this important to learn?\\nLC: It’s sort of one of the skills that if you had to learn ten basic skills, how to make a slab would be one of them. You would eventually find that you would need to know how to do that. It’s just such a simple thing. I guess it’s like any other material like if you’re going to be a woodworker, how do you take a pencil and a square and a handsaw and cut the end of a board off and it’s square? Most people can’t do that. Most people never have been shown how to do that. Most people now take it and put it an electric saw and cut it up.\\nAW: Sounds like you met some more mentors and teachers there.\\nLC: Yeah, lots of great people there. That was a really good place for me. Plus, I’m a compulsive skier, so one of my goals there was to not ski, which was really good for me. But my little group of people that I was really tight with, we all loved to ski, so we had some great ski trips: skiing up the backside of glaciers, winter camping or staying in these alpine huts and skiing down, it was just my idea of heaven, climbing, oh, I love that kind of life.\\nAW: Yeah, so many outdoors activities that you can do in an area like that, a really beautiful environment.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n31\\nLC: I probably didn’t mention that in between my college years I worked in the summers up in the Boundary Waters and in Ontario. My family, we were canoers growing up and campers, so I had those skills so I would do that in the summer. When I got out of Banff, when I was done there, I actually tried to emigrate to Canada because I liked it so much there, but I was unsuccessful. When I came back to Minnesota I didn’t know where to live and I was thinking that what I would do is basically set up a base camp and in the summer I would run canoe trips and then in the winter I would work in the studio and my summer would support my winter. That was my thinking, which was actually ridiculous because there’s no money in guiding canoe trips, sort of like potting—it wasn’t something that you would pick as a career if you wanted to make money. But I had that thought so that was what got me thinking about moving a log house. At that time I was by myself and found this cheap land and found a house to move. I kind of naively thought that I could get people to come up from the Twin Cities and basically camp here for a few days and I teach them basic skills that they needed to learn and then we’d take a three week trip somewhere and then we’d come back here and have a sauna and then they’d go home and they’d write me a big check. (Laughs)\\n02:56:10\\nAW: How did that work?\\nLC: Well, once I got my land and the cabin here, I realized that I didn’t want people here. I didn’t want to do that. I wanted the quiet, and it just seemed like that would be a whole different career that had its own problems and fundraising issues and I couldn’t do both. I had tried piano tuning too. I thought that would be a good way to support myself, but then I realized quickly that with piano tuning you were right or wrong and you had to do it everyday or you were wrong. I gave that up too.\\nAW: So you got done with your degree in Canada, then you moved back to Minnesota. Why did you buy this land?\\nLC: First I rented a house. I didn’t know where to go. My mother was still alive in Wisconsin. I wanted to be sort of near her but not too far away. I drew a circle around the Twin Cities about an hour and I thought, I’ll go north because it’s closer to canoeing. I found a little house to rent and the people were very nice; they let me build a kiln. That was part of the deal. When I left school I had three thousand dollars. I was kind of enterprising: I taught community education and I had this full scholarship, and I was selling my work through the galleries, and we had student sales, too. So I had a little fistful of money to get going. So I did, I got going. I built a kiln, scavenged all my bricks, pretty much all free, I bought a little cheap wheel and got to work and I ran out of money by October.\\nAW: When would you say you started?\\nLC: It would have been July. Yeah, by October I was out of money. (Laughs)\\nAW: What did you think then?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n32\\nLC: I was pretty upset, you know, as you would be. I didn’t know what I was doing. I had put a little sign up by my driveway that said “Pottery,” and I had a little box for money. A few people would stop out of curiosity. But the kiln was crummy and it didn’t work very well. I was lonesome. I didn’t know one person. I was so lonesome and I was living my dream, having my own studio, and kind of a recluse. It was really hard. But it was really good for me. I had to figure out how to connect with what I was making and I had to figure out how to make some friends. I felt like my education really began at that point, when I didn’t have enough money to buy a postage stamp. It was really good for me. I found a wheel that was a Korean-style kick wheel and I had to kick it all the time—you could never stop. I had mixed my clay on a big tarp on the ground with water and a hose and all that. The clay was so hard I could hardly get it to work on the wheel and it was so frustrating, and I was tearing my hair out; I couldn’t figure it out, how to do this with this crappy wheel and this clay that was too hard. It was horrible. I would cry it was just so awful and I was lonesome and it was really awful. I was sitting there one day and I thought, Duh, make the clay softer, that might help. So I made the clay softer and I put it on the wheel—and I couldn’t work in my normal method—at that point I was using an electric wheel at Banff because that’s what they had, so my work was stiff and hard and machined and I couldn’t do that with this little wheel. So I thought, Make the clay soft. I made the clay soft, and then suddenly it was like, Oh, I get it. I could relax and I could kick slow, work real slow. The wheel could barely spin around and I could still work with it. It was like, This could be good. It was like a door opened. Nobody showed it to me, it was just desperation. It was an amazing moment for me. Over time I realized, Gee, this wheel is great, and then I remembered the wheels I had learned on at school: the Leach treadle wheel. By that point I had met Jeff Oestreich and he had one of those wheels and he wanted another one, so we found a couple at the Edina Art Center. I bought one and then it was like, Aha, there’s some hope. I have some hope. That was really where I felt like I was connecting with the material in a way that had a sense of life and curiosity—not that I could do it very well, but I really felt a spark of something. Wow, this could be good, this could be good for me, not that the work could be good but that this could be good for me, trying in this method, with these restrictions, this could be good. This could lead somewhere. That really set me on to where I am today. It took having to reinvent everything I had learned—it must be like going into the army or something, where they break you down and build you back up. But it was sort of like that.\\n03:03:25\\nAW: When you moved into the area you said you met Jeff Oestreich. Did you know any other potters? Did you have a sense that there were other potters around?\\nLC: No, I didn’t know anyone that lived around here at all.\\nAW: When was this again, when you moved in?\\nLC: Hmm, I don’t know, 1977, maybe. Yeah, 1977. When I ran out of money I worked at a ski area and there was another woman working there—just the two of us—and she was house-sitting for Jeff Oestreich. I had seen his sign but I didn’t know who he was or what he did. I was so busy I didn’t pay attention; I never went down there. We became friends working and she said, “Why don’t you come for supper?” I followed the sign and it was just a few miles away. It’s ridiculous A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n33\\nthat I didn’t go down there. I remember I walked in the door and there was a little drawing on the wall that Bernard Leach had drawn for Jeff and it said, “From Bernard to Jeff,” and then here was a Michael Cardew pot, and I saw immediately that Jeff and I shared some sensibilities about pottery. It was like, Oh, wow, this could be my brother, or an uncle, he must be a relative of mine, an aesthetic ally. I picked up on that right away and so I could hardly wait to meet him. That was really wonderful, that was really delightful to discover him. Then there was another woman, another potter, Janel Jacobson, who lived near Sunrise. I didn’t know anything about her. She had been trained in a different school, the Marguerite Wildenhain Bauhaus sensibility. I didn’t really connect with that kind of aesthetic, but I really connected with Janel because she was doing what I wanted to do. I admired her very much. There were three of us really. We did quite a few things together early on. We made a little brochure together. That was the first marketing, maybe one of the only few marketing things I have ever done. Jeff and Janel and I had put out a flyer with a map on it and picture of us and we each wrote a little something. We put them at the tourist spots where the tourists would stop. That was our initial effort to do something collectively. I guess in a way you could think of that as a beginning of a tour, in a way. In a certain way it was a collective effort to help each other out, help each other out making our living independently, which is another commonality with the Tour [St. Croix Tour]—each studio does their own thing in a way, but collectively we help each other. We each do what we want to do, need to do, by ourselves, but team up together as a group. I don’t know what year that would be, probably 1978 or 1979 maybe?\\nSo I ran out of money and basically was homeless for a little while. I found a house to housesit, which is what people do when you don’t have a home. I found a free place to live and I asked Jeff if I could work at his studio for the winter. I did that along with a fellow Hamline friend named Mark Baden, who taught ceramics for years at Northwestern (University).This friend of mine Mark Baden.\\nAW: When was he there?\\nLC: At Northwestern? I think he just retired maybe five years ago. He was there from 1980 to 2010, or so. He was there for a long time. The three of us worked together for one winter, which was really nice, an incredible time.\\nAW: What was so nice about it?\\nLC: Oh, we were just so excited about making pots and just worked really hard and we were all younger and excited. Jeff was always remodeling something, his studio or his house or something, and Mark and I would pitch in and we helped quite a bit on the studio. You know, starting to get invited to be in shows and things like that. It was fun. None of us had much money but we were doing what we wanted; we were young and it was fun. It was fun to have an ally that you could borrow materials from, or if something was really troubling you could hash it out and try to figure it out what was going on, if something’s wrong with the clay or the glaze. It was nice to not be alone, not feel so alone. Maybe I worked for five years doing odd jobs and then I could finally support myself. I worked at that ski area, I made snow and did some welding, and worked on the chair lift. I worked in a fire tower. I always picked kind of seasonal, high-pay, A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n34\\noutdoor kind of jobs where I could be outside. Worked as a fire fighter for the DNR. Those kinds of jobs.\\n03:10:52\\nAW: Did those jobs have any kind of influence on your ceramics, if you’re outside and in these environments?\\nLC: I don’t think so. I saw being in the studio as my job and then I saw my job as my hobby. I looked at it that way. Often times I would go to work really tired. But firefighting and working at the ski area, those were really physically demanding. That was really good because you’d be really tired, that was really good. I liked that. I like physical work. That was really good for me and paid pretty well. It was seasonal so you knew it would end, which was important to me. I wanted to just work for a few months and then get out of there. I wanted to work hard, make as much money as I could, and then get out of there. The fire tower was probably one of the best jobs because it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful job and it was so visual, I really enjoyed that. I always picked these jobs where you needed some kind of observational skill. I didn’t mention this, but in high school I was a lifeguard. As a lifeguard you’re not looking for who’s drowning, you’re being spaced out, really, just getting the general look of everything. You’re trying to figure out what’s wrong, what’s out of order, which is a real visual job. The fire tower was like that too. You’re just watching, scanning, you’re just slowly turn in a circle all day long, you just keep turning in a circle, kind of spaced out thinking about whatever it its you want to think about but you’re looking at stuff but, not focusing too hard on too many things. That allows you to see what’s wrong, what’s different. I always like those jobs where you can employ those visual skills. The fire tower job was really nice for that because I could watch birds and animals and that was great to just sit and watch nature from high above. The animals didn’t know you were watching them. I saw deer playing tag; just like kids, they play tag, “You’re it.” They nudge one and then they all run around and try to avoid the one that was it. Just like we do. That was great; that was fantastic to watch that.\\nAW: I remember something you said earlier about, I think, looking for what is the problem, and wanting to solve the problem. I think you described it in an initial interest in drawing but in pottery too. Is there a pattern here?\\nLC: It is a pattern. I see it as a pattern. There is a material that has a certain characteristic or order to it and what’s interesting is what is out of order. How do you develop a vocabulary with the material and give it a different order that has some interest to you, whatever that is? A tension or balanced beauty or whatever your idea of compelling interest is. For somebody who is visually based or who greets the world with vision, that’s what it’s about—it’s about order and disorder and regularity/irregularity, and then finding a material to work with that is of some interest to you. I think that’s what visual people do. I don’t really know this, but it’s what I think. I’ve never heard anyone say this, but that’s probably what I would have to say about it.\\n03:16:00\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n35\\nAW: How does that translate into pottery, that kind of problem-solving? Sorry, maybe you’ve already defined this clearly?\\nLC: I guess if you relate pottery and music, maybe that would be an analogy that you could understand. Musicians, or people concerned with music—this is maybe minimalizing it—you’re either a composer or an interpreter, a performer: somebody who likes to invent or somebody who likes to work with theme and variation. There’s classics or standards, if you talk about the form of music and I think with pottery—I think we’re closest to music than other art forms, maybe architecture too—but with pottery we have our standard forms: plates, cups, baking things, serving things—they’re standards, they’re classic forms. There’s kind of nothing new in a way. If you look at thousands and thousands and thousands of years there’s not a lot that’s too new. Technology changes but the problem or the opportunity or the form doesn’t change all that much. If you see it that way, we’re more like interpreters than composers. Talk about the problem—what’s the problem? The problem is a form. It’s a limited problem. It’s got a lot of restrictions to it: to make a cup that feels good in your hand, or makes you want to set it down and look at it, holds the heat, doesn’t hold the heat, holds the ice, sounds good with the ice, is rounded, is straight-walled. What’s it going to hold? How is it going to feel on your lip? Does it have a handle? Does it need a handle? There’s so many variations just in that word, “cup,” there’s an infinite number of possibilities. It’s a very narrow, narrow, narrow area of interest if you think about the whole spectrum of ceramics or visual arts—there’s 360 degrees of possibilities but we’re working with—I don’t know what degree, maybe only 10—but within that little area there’s an infinite number of possibilities. I see it like that—it’s limited but there’s as much room as you can make in that limited little area. I don’t think it’s that different than, say, being a writer or being a musician—a lot of other forms there’s limitations and then there’s your material, skills, what’s compelling to you that’s a problem/opportunity, form, whatever you want to call that. I can’t remember what your question was?\\nAW: That helps, I thought it would be helpful to have some more explanation. You started to talk about activities with Jeff and Janel. What else was going on at that time in the St. Croix River Valley? You did some shows together?\\nLC: Yeah, but not around here. We all individually had our own sales at our own studios. Janel was going to the Renaissance Festival. I think that had just started. There were a few art fairs around. In our area there were two. The Minnesota Arts Council had an art fair at St. Kate’s. Then there was one at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts called the Rose Fete. I think that was the name. Jeff and I did those, and I don’t think that either one of us did well—it wasn’t productive, I would put it that way. I only did a few art fairs in my life, maybe three—I think I did one more and I found myself between a taxidermist and somebody that made ceramic license plates for your bicycle that were personalized, like it would say Debbie or something made out of clay, and you would hang it on your bike. I just felt that I didn’t fit in between the taxidermist and that, so I think I just packed up and left and that was it. I thought I’d never ever do that again. There were a few galleries that were interested. Jeff and I had some work at Groveland Gallery, which is still going, right behind the Walker. They have mostly drawings and prints, and they had drawings and prints then, and ceramics. There was one cooperative gallery and I don’t remember much about it. I think it was down by Macalester on Grand Avenue called—can’t remember the name of it. There was this Minnesota Crafts Council. That was sort of the only thing going in A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n36\\nterms of a community that I was aware of. Jeff and I were involved with that. I think we took care of the mailing list. This was before computers and everything, and we did it by hand. Then it moved to a punch card kind of system.\\n03:23:00\\nLC: For some reason I was invited, along with Jeff—Jeff knew Warren MacKenzie—and for some reason, I met Warren through—I’m not even sure how. I guess I was invited to be part of his annual fall sale. He invited his former students and a few others. I was sort of the adopted child, which was pretty amazing to me. I had never met Warren and I didn’t know much about him, really, at that point which seems odd to say. I don’t think I had ever seen a pot of his until after I had moved here. Mark was one of Warren’s students. I guess maybe I had heard his name, but I wouldn’t have met him, I don’t think. I might have met him when I went to see Betty Woodman, but I probably wouldn’t have known who he was. That’s neither here or there. For some reason I was lucky enough to be invited to be part of that annual sale, and Warren has been so supportive and really generous in helping me in so many ways over the years—lots of sales. A few of us he invited to leave our work after the sale at his studio and then he would sell it and give us a check, which was incredible. It was like a little gallery. He took no commission—unbelievable. We would try and do little things for him. He never wanted thanks, so we would try and do some little favor for him and not let him know because he wouldn’t want to be thanked; that sort of person, so generous. That was really lucky, very helpful.\\nWe talked about Bruce White earlier; his mother Helen White was a historian. She was really helpful to all of us potters, Jeff, Janel and I. Helen restored a number of old buildings in Taylor’s Falls and wrote many, many history books published by the Minnesota Historical Society. She turned one of these historic buildings into a bed and breakfast. She bought pots from us and put it in the bed and breakfast. She really thought that people would stay at the bed and breakfast, see the pots, and they would flock to us and buy our work. She was so great—I don’t think that anyone ever came from that. She bought our work and donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society. I wish I could change it out now and give them something better. She was very helpful to us in many ways, and was a role model for me for sure and I’m sure for Jeff as well because she was a serious writer, a serious historian, and found a way to live in a little town and make a living. She had this two-prong history life—one serious historical books, and then this little newspaper called the Dalles Visitor, which was to bring history to the masses with photographs and real articles. She was really something: she spoke her mind and she was a preservationist and she was run out of town on a rail by the city council because she confronted them when they burned down a house that was on the National Historic Registry. They swore at her and called her every name in the book—at a city council meeting—and she left. Many years later she bought a house in town and she came back. She painted it the color of this house that burned down and they made her the queen of the parade. They reconciled and it was amazing, the story of Helen White. Someone could write a book about her and her life, a very interesting woman. She was really important to us three initial potters. She was a force for us, she was an ally, working in a different field but definitely a force.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nL. Christianson\\n06/17/14\\n37\\nAW: What was your sense of the history of this area when you moved in? Did she help you engage in this place through history that you might have learned through her? Or more so she was a supporter of your work and ceramics?

Also present during this interview is Tierney McNabb, Project Assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed. Why don’t we get started? First if you could tell us about when and where you were born?\\nGC: I was born in Venezuela in 1951 in a city called Maracaibo, which is on the border with Colombia; it’s in western Venezuela.\\nAW: And how do you spell that? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n2\\nGC: M-a-r-a-c-a-i-b-o. And it’s where the center of the oil industry was located when it first started in the 1920s.\\n[AUDIO NOTE: Sound of bird clock.]\\nAW: Is your family from that region?\\nGC: No, not at all. My father is Colombian, or was Colombian, and my mother was born in Chile. Her grandparents were immigrants from the United Kingdom.\\nAW: And why did they come over from the UK?\\nGC: I’m not really sure, but my mom’s dad worked with the mining industry in Chile, and then early on, when my mom was about 7 or so, they moved to Peru, where he continued to work up in the high Andes in copper mining. The mining industry is so volatile that it’s boom and bust, so the jobs end in one place and start in another, so she ended up being raised in Peru. My father eventually went to an agronomy school in Lima and met my mom, and they married, and my dad actually got a job with a man—Nelson Rockefeller had many interests in Venezuela, and one of them was this production of milk, so there was a milk-processing plant in Maracaibo and my father got a job working there.\\nAW: And what were your parents’ names?\\nGC: Alipio Cuellar is my dad, and Aïda is my mom.\\nAW: Are they still living?\\nGC: My dad died in 1999, and my mom’s still with us. She lives in Lima right now. Lima, Peru.\\n[Update: Aïda passed away on October 12, 2014]\\nAW: Did she go to college, as well?\\nGC: She did, she did. Many small world stories, but one is that she was a foreign exchange student—she and her sister managed to get some financing to go to a small college in Iowa called Cornell College, and she was there for a year, as a foreign exchange student. I ended up going to that same school, and that’s where I first started making pots in 1970. My wife Laurie was also a freshman that same year, so we started Cornell at the same time. And Laurie’s grandfather had been dean of the college, and he had been the person that had been in charge of taking care of my mom and her sister when they went to school at that school.\\nAW: Why did you pick Cornell?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n3\\nGC: Well, my dad was very much interested in having this business and having it grow, and he wanted me to train to become a business manager or to study chemical engineering and get a masters degree in business or something like that so that I could work with him in all of his projects and plans. That didn’t work out so well, but they sent me to the U.S.—and I went to international schools, or English-speaking schools, in Venezuela, so I learned English when I was very young. They sent me to school in the States so that I could, you know, study all of these things. My dad actually had gone to school in the States, too, and he got a master’s in animal husbandry in the University of Illinois. So they were both big fans of the Midwest—they loved the Midwest of the United States. They thought that it just had all the right values. They really identified with that.\\n00:05:20\\nGC: They sent me to some high schools in the U.S. for four years of high school, as well. And I was alone, I was a high school student, I didn’t have a lot of supervision—I was having a wonderful time, but I wasn’t getting a whole lot of work done. So it was basically this is your choice: you can either go to college at Cornell, or we won’t fund your college education. At that time I was going to school in Massachusetts. It was the late ’60s. There was all kinds of stuff going on: the Vietnam War, there were protests, the moratorium, and I was involved in all of that stuff because that’s what the times were about. So they were trying to take me out of that area and put me in a place that they thought was going to be very good as far as values. I wanted to go to college, but I was very much thinking that this was going to be a real drag to be in Iowa—that it was going to be a cultural desert—and it didn’t turn out to be that way at all. I really actually loved Iowa. It was just a really wonderful experience going to school there.\\nAW: What was it about it that you loved?\\nGC: I loved the people. And it was a small school. There was a ceramics teacher—Doug Hanson. It was his first year as a teacher. He had graduated from the University of Iowa in Iowa City, and he had some really good teachers there: Chuck Hines, Bunny McBride. It was his first year teaching—he’s always been an incredibly good and patient teacher and tolerant and encouraging. And I was so excited about pottery that I was in the studio all the time, I was always doing something, I was always making him do more work than he needed to do. And he was just really happy with that. He was excited to have someone that was excited about clay. So that whole experience really contributed to that general feeling. But, you know, just the people in Iowa were wonderful—the teachers in general—the school was great.\\nAW: Had you had experience with pottery before?\\nGC: No. It was just fulfilling a humanities requirement for the liberal arts degree. I had to take some art classes, so I took drawing and then ceramics.\\nAW: And what year was that?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n4\\nGC: Nineteen seventy was my first year of college.\\nAW: Okay, so it was during your first year.\\nGC: Yeah.\\nAW: What did you think in that class? What were your first impressions of working with clay? Can you tell us more about those first experiences?\\nGC: I ran into this book by Bernard Leach, which is The Potter’s Book. It must have launched the careers of any number of potters, but I was one of them. I was just absolutely taken by his efforts to define what constitutes a good pot. Of course, that was his opinion, but he had many interesting arguments. Just the concept of making pots for use—functional pots—I guess at that time was extremely important to me, and it sort of did also fit in with the times of, you know—there are a lot of trite phrases like going back to the land, and everything being natural, and all of this stuff—but it really did appeal to me. I think it’s really still pretty central to why I make pots is that sense that I’m doing something that in some way is constructive. That the pots have a positive function in people’s lives. That they encourage people to do things that are good in many different ways. I mean taking time to prepare good food, taking time to sit around a table with family or friends, generating community. The aesthetics—the art part of making pots—was critical to me, but also the fact that the pots were providing a service. Yeah, that’s still really central to me.\\n00:10:54\\nAW: Did you take more pottery classes during your time at Cornell?\\nGC: Yeah, I pretty much took a class every semester for the first two years, and then my parents realized that I was spending all of my time in the studio making pots, and so my funding dried up. So I was out of school for two years, and during that time, I had a couple of really, really important experiences. A friend and I drove from Venezuela to Chile. And I probably spent six months in that adventure, going to all of these different countries and really being impressed with how different the cultures were in each one of these supposedly similar countries—they all spoke Spanish—but it was really an amazing experience. Chile was in the middle of the last few weeks of Allende’s regime, so we had a hard time getting out of Chile. That whole political experience was incredible. And in Bolivia, we spent all of our time with people that were involved in the music scene—with the Andean music, which at the time was just beginning to become really important. I don’t know if Paul Simon had already written—or “written,” sort of taken over—that “El Condor Pasa.” But it was beginning to be recognized in the world, and we were there at time when there were all of these places where groups got together to play, and every night it would be different music—just a fantastic cultural experience. Peru, I have a lot of family in Peru, so there was a huge family kind of thing going on in Peru. So yeah, every country was great—was really, really interesting.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n5\\nThen when I got back to Venezuela, I got a job for the person that I sold the—of course it was a VW—bus. We sold the VW bus to this gentleman who had a project to do an aerial geophysical survey of the Venezuelan Amazon. He was working with these old RAF pilots from the Second World War, and South African mercenaries, and people like that, and technicians in a DC-3 and flying over the Venezuelan Amazon, but none of them spoke any Spanish, so they needed somebody to kind of arrange everything—a fixer. So that was my job with them for a while during those couple of years, and that was fantastic experience: to be able to get to wild places, really incredible places. (Chuckling) And these guys were informal, to say the least, so if we were flying along and we spotted a runway and a little stream, they might just land and go fishing for a little while, and then we’d continue flying. (Laughs)\\nAW: (Laughs) They must not have been on a tight research timeframe.\\nGC: Yeah, no. No. But that was an incredible experience, as well. The kind of people that lived in the Amazon at the time—there was this Hungarian that ran the restaurant that we normally ate at; there were all the missionaries; there were the Indians; there was the National Guard. The interactions between all of those people were just a fantastic cultural experience for me.\\nBut time went on, and I eventually got back to Caracas, and I landed at my parents’ house again. And they had kind of painted themselves into the corner that they weren’t going to help me if I was going to make pots, and I wasn’t going to do anything other than making pots, so eventually, I managed to get some scholarship help, and the school gave me some help, and I managed to get back to Cornell and finish. The government was handing out this scholarship money at the time, so my last year there I had a scholarship to do a geology major because you had to do something that was within the requirements. So I said, “Okay, I’ll get a geology major.” I majored in geology, and I also majored in art. I had been taking French classes also—the foreign student adviser, a guy called Harvey Stein, who was just this wonderful, wonderful man, he said, “Well you know, if you take one or two more classes, you can get a French major, too.” So I got a French major, which essentially is getting a lot of majors and not really knowing anything about any one of them. Then when I graduated in 1976, Laurie and I got married. Laurie and I had met first year in school. She graduated in ’74 and went to work. She went to Chicago and did social work and stuff and then came back to Melbourne [sic; corrected by GC to Iowa]. Then when I graduated, we got married, and we went back to Venezuela on vacation. And we stayed there for thirty years.\\n00:16:40\\nAW: How did that happen?\\nGC: Well, it was very nice there. It was a wonderful time. Venezuela was going through a real boom. You remember—of course, you wouldn’t remember. Speed limits in the U.S. were 55, Jimmy Carter was president. There was this oil crisis that the U.S. had; for Venezuela, was the oil boom. Money was just raining down from the sky. Many, many people from all over the world living in Venezuela, working. It was just full of all kinds of interesting people, parties, and A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n6\\nwe did all kinds of stuff: trekking, diving. I got a job as a project manager for the World Wildlife Fund—a Venezuelan affiliate called Fudena. That was three years, and I got an opportunity to travel around the country. A lot of our research was in remote areas with endangered species, trying to find out if there were any crocodiles, where they were, manatees, some birds—a red siskin, which was an endangered bird. So I got into contact with a lot of the natives, the indigenous people of the country, and came into contact with a lot of their handwork. I have a lot of it lying around, but mostly baskets, a lot of fiber work, some pots—well, hammocks, dugout canoes—even their houses were all these wonderful handmade things. I just was really fascinated with the way they related to their handwork and to art in their lives—how art was just always present in their lives. That was a big impression, and I guess you would say an influence of some sort—even though it wasn’t a direct influence. But their relationship with their work again reinforced that idea of having your work be somehow a service to the people around you, to the families, to the community. That was one of the really nice things about that job was being involved with that.\\nThen, eventually, while I was working there, there’s an English-language Venezuelan newspaper called The Daily Journal—three of the most important potters that I had really admired through Leach’s book and from a distance—I’d never met them—they died, and there were articles about them in this newspaper. And I thought, “Who else in this country would even know who these people were?” I mean, they were famous potters but in general pretty obscure people. So when Leach died, and then Hamada died, I thought, You know, I’m missing the boat. I really want to become a part of that historical sweep of pottery-making. I wanted to have the opportunity to see how these people worked and what things were important to them. So I decided to try to start making pots, and I was failing miserably, and having a horrible time. I went out and talked to some people, and I found that Warren MacKenzie was coming to Venezuela to teach a workshop. And of course, the workshop was full, and I had to find a way to get into it. I made friends with the president of the organization, and I told her that whatever they wanted me to do, you know, I could interpret, I could help build a kiln—I had already done that, so I basically told them that they couldn’t run the workshop without me and they fell for it. So I met Warren there, we made friends, it was an incredible experience; I’d never seen anyone work with clay the way he did. Warren had been an apprentice at a production pottery—I guess you would call it a production pottery—and he could move the clay with an ease and a casual—just, it was fantastic. People would ask him why he didn’t bother to center the clay. You know, he was centering the clay so easily that people didn’t even notice that he was centering before he started to throw. So that was an incredible experience, and I said, “This is the dude. This is the guy who’s gonna be a window into that history of pots,” that I so much wanted to connect with. And I told him that, and he must have had any number of people trying to get him to take them on as apprentices or teach them or whatever, and he said, “Yeah. But I can only teach you one kind of pots to make.” I said, “Those are the pots that I’m interested in.” It must have made some impression because a few years later, he wrote to us, and he invited Laurie and me to come up to his house and make pots with him for a month and have a sale. He also invited a woman called Clary Illian, who was also a Leach apprentice. She had been in Iowa, and actually she had been close to Cornell College, and I had gone to her studio and asked her if she would take me on as an apprentice. But she was involved with nurturing women artists, and she wanted to focus on that, so that hadn’t A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n7\\nworked out, but it was great to reconnect with her. And there was another Minnesota artist, Christie Wert, who was there.\\nSo there were the five of us making pots, and then we had a pottery sale. That experience, as much as making the pots and seeing how the showroom worked, how the studio worked, you know, how the process went from materials, mixing clay, glazes, doing all the bisquing, glazing, and everything, and doing the firing—I’d never been in a studio that had it together, that was doing a good job making pots. So that was great, but the experience of getting a group of potters together and having a sale was really wonderful. It was incredible: just that community effort towards a mutual benefit of the group—that was really cool. I was really excited about that. And I eventually went back to Venezuela, and a couple of years passed, and I said, “Why don’t we try to do that here?” So I called a few of my friends. Initially there were ten potters and two jewelers, and we had a sale at my place. We lived outside of the city—about 30 miles outside of Caracas in an old coffee-growing area—it was a very beautiful place, beautiful views, very hard to get to—a long, windy little road to get out there—and so we thought, Well, we’ll have a sale. My original thought was, We’ll have a sale at my place, then we’ll have a sale at his place, and then we’ll have a sale at her place, and that way we’re going to let the public know that all of these people in all of these places are making and selling handwork: pots or whatever. But the way it turned out, our first sale we were certain that nobody was going to come because you have to build it up and, you know. Well, we had so many people come out that we couldn’t keep up. It was overwhelming. Everybody was walking around with a huge grin on their faces, and we had lines of people at the checkout. We made a lot of food and gave people food because there was no place to get any food out there—it was out in the middle of nowhere in the country. I think the public was really surprised at the fact that people came out there and that they could eat and have coffee and, you know, just have a nice time as well as buy the pots. That sale became a really popular and—it was kind of on the horizon nationally as a ceramic event or as an art, or as a cultural event. It must have been a real slow news day, but we actually even one time were on the front page of a national newspaper. It wasn’t the headline, but it was on the—Here in the States it would be almost unbelievable to have that happen. However, last year we had a full page in the Pioneer Press, color pictures and stuff—there must be one around here, Laurie will know where it is. So, referring back to the St. Croix Valley Tour, it is really important, I think, here in the state of Minnesota; it’s got a really big presence.\\nSo this went on for many years in Venezuela. We had two sales a year, one in May, one in November, always sold out, had people come out. It was a beautiful natural situation. We were out in the forest, sloths would be walking by in the trees, and people—Caracas is a big city, and it’s a very city kind of city—so to them, I think, it was amazing that they could go thirty miles out of town and kind of travel back in time a hundred years. All of that was really wonderful.\\nI’m not sure where to go from here. Am I going on way too long?\\n00:28:25\\nAW: You are doing great. Sometimes all it takes is one question, and— A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n8\\nGC: —And you’ve got the whole interview. (Laughs)\\nAW: Actually, there are a number of questions I’d like to follow up on a little bit. Just to finish your flow, I think you were getting to how you came to Minnesota.\\nGC: Yeah.\\nAW: You were talking about hosting this tour in Venezuela after having studied with Warren MacKenzie—\\nGC: —Been exposed—I never studied with Warren. I’ve never been his student, or I’ve never really actually even taken a workshop with him. I’ve been an assistant at his workshops, a couple of them—but if you ask him, he would say I’ve never been his student. That, for some reason, is important to him. So I (chuckling) I want to keep that clear.\\nAfter being exposed to his studio and that pottery sale, yeah, we took that experience and really made it into something really special in Venezuela. It was really amazing.\\nAW: What was it called?\\nGC: It was called Encuentro—El Encuentro—and the town where we lived was Turgua: T-u-r-g-u-a.\\nAW: And how do you spell the name of the event?\\nGC: Encuentro is “encounter” in Spanish, and it’s not exactly the same meaning, but it’s something like that. Encuentro is getting together, gathering, maybe a celebration—it was kind of a situation where people would meet that hadn’t seen each other for years and years, and they’d meet there, and you’d see all these people having a really nice social situation.\\nAW: And when was the first year you started that?\\nGC: Nineteen ninety-two. Then it went on for thirteen years. We did about twenty-six or twenty-seven of them. There was a year where we tried to do a couple more, but that was not a good idea. It was too much to ask people to come out three times in a year.\\n00:30:48\\nAW: So you did May and November, pretty much?\\nGC: Yeah. Mother’s Day—actually we did it the weekend before Mother’s Day so people would have a chance to come out and get a present before Mother’s Day. In November, it was the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n9\\nweekend before Thanksgiving because there were a lot of foreigners who came, and they were always off on vacation. Laurie?\\nLM: Yeah?\\nGC: If you go upstairs and come back down, could you bring one of those Turgua books?\\nLM: Sure.\\nGC: Then the social and political situation in Venezuela started to change, and became less attractive to live there. Mostly crime became really rampant—just kind of insecurity, people breaking in all the time. Everyone that you knew had had his car stolen at least once. I think over my lifetime there I had four cars stolen. Well, the pickup that I bought—Laurie?—lasted six weeks?\\nLM: Yeah.\\nGC: It had 900 kilometers on it—\\nLM: —Yeah— Don’t tell me, I don’t want to hear about this.\\nGC: You don’t want to relive all that?\\nLM: No.\\nGC: The last one that was stolen was this car that we had set up for carrying our kayaks on the roof, and we were taking people and doing trips. When I saw that car drive out and I chased them down the block about four blocks, I figured, I don’t want to buy another car. That was kind of like the [last] straw. And it was kind of hard to get raw materials to make pots anymore. The dollar had become—there was no convertibility of the Venezuelan currency. So you couldn’t go out with bolívares and buy dollars. That was supposed to be illegal, although everyone did it, because the official exchange rate was, say, three, and the black market exchange rate would be thirteen or something like that. It was such a spread. So, the economy went downhill, and mainly we just felt that we couldn’t make a living making pots there anymore. And our kids graduated from high school; they were going to go to college in the U.S. Laurie was a teacher all that time at an international school—one of the schools that I had gone to as a kid. Our kids went to school there.\\nAW: What school was that?\\nGC: It was called, E.C.A.—Escuela campo alegre.\\nAW: Can you spell the last word?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n10\\nGC: A-l-e-g-r-e.\\nAW: Was that a high school?\\nGC: It was a high school. Elementary and high school, yeah.\\nAW: Was that also in the same town where you were?\\nGC: In Caracas. It was not in the town where we were. We lived outside of town for a long time, and then we had to move into town because the traffic was—you know, the kids, they would have to leave the house before six in the morning to get to school without getting a huge traffic jam because if you left a little bit later, then it could take two hours to get to school. It was really stop, start—crazy, crazy traffic. So we decided we needed to move in. We moved in to an apartment that they could walk to school from. That apartment was kind of a miracle that we were able to get that. But then I was commuting from there. Halfway back out to where my studio was, there was a studio of a friend of mine, so I shared the studio with her for a few years. But that wasn’t a situation that was going to continue forever; she moved back to her family’s—\\n[Laurie arrives with Turgua book (available in American Craft Council Library).] Thank you, darling. It’s kind of unfortunate that the images are not very good—and it’s in Spanish—but here are some pictures of what our pottery sale area looked like.\\n00:35:34\\nAW: Wow.\\nGC: Yeah, it was all, kind of, forested.\\nAW: Wow.\\nGC: This was a day when it rained all day, and people came anyway. (Showing image) This was just kind desperation—it was, kind of going, (gestures) like that. People came out and they would fall and get mud all over their butts, and they were smiling and they were having a great time anyway. Really, the more adventurous it was, I think, for them, the more they enjoyed it.\\nAW: This is a very sweet photograph, I think. You and Warren?\\nGC: Yeah. I guess I was leaving or something, and--\\nAW: So all of these potters that joined you, have you stayed in touch with them?\\nGC: A lot of them I have, yeah.\\nAW: Are many of them still in Venezuela?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n11\\nGC: Most of them are not. But you know, life goes on—\\nAW: —Were many of them from Venezuela?\\nGC: There were many from Venezuela. Many from Venezuela, and many from abroad, too. The one that I shared a studio with is living in Nice now. She was kind of from all over the place, and her mother was living in Nice and getting old, so she moved back to take care of her mom, and her mom’s since passed away. She’s still there. There’s another person who’s in Boston, now, and she was the person who did a lot of these wonderful prints. She did woodcuts and stuff.\\nThis book was made because the editor—the printer—he was really into pots. This just happened, you know; it wasn’t anybody’s—it was kind of a gift. In one sense it’s too bad because it would have been nice if we had had some more control over the quality of the images and stuff, but this is a picture out of our bedroom window. And this is the area where the pottery sale would happen.\\nAW: Mm hmm. Which direction are we looking?\\nGC: South. That’s southeast. So there’s a number of ridges that are going parallel to the Andes. At the north end of the South American continent and at the south end of the South American continent, they’ve been sheared off so they run east-west, so along the northern coast of Venezuela are the Andes, and there’s all the foothills of the Andes, so that’s what this area is.\\nAW: It’s beautiful.\\nGC: That’s a picture of my studio.\\nAW: Do you have multiple copies of that?\\nGC: You can have one.\\nAW: The American Craft Council might [like one]. So this is a multiple copy—not you’re only one?\\nGC: Yeah, I have several other copies. I’m just not terribly happy with the images of the pots. There’s a lot of different levels of—you know, people that were closer to beginners—and so. But it’s what it is.\\nAW: Well, thank you. I think it would be nice to pair with your interview to have this.\\nGC: Mm hmm.\\nAW: So that sale went on until about 2003-2004?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n12\\nGC: No, I think 1995 or so was the last time that we did [one].\\nAW: You said that the Tour went for about thirteen years?\\nGC: —There’s actually—I’ll get you another one: I see someone’s actually written some things in here, in pencil, so that was nice. I couldn’t swear about the dates. So there’s a 2002 Encuentro Turgua, it says here.\\n00:40:22\\nAW: And you started it in 1992?\\nGC: Yeah, but it didn’t go on for twenty years.\\nAW: 1992 to 2002 would be eleven or so years.\\nGC: Oh, you’re right, you’re right. Yeah, it would have gone on until about 2005.\\nAW: And how and when and why did you decide to leave Venezuela? And why Minnesota?\\nGC: Minnesota, because after working at Warren’s in ’84, I started going up there every summer. I’d share a studio space with him and his wife Nancy for a month/five weeks. Laurie would come up with the kids, and they would go and visit grandparents and have a summer vacation up there. I would spend that time making pots at Warren’s studio. After a few years, when he decided that he could trust me to be there by myself without making a disaster, they started taking off during that time, and I would hold the fort. During that time, I met a lot of potters in Minnesota. I met Linda Christiansen—and not just Minnesota, but in the area: Randy Johnson, Mark Pharis, Jeff Oestreich. And many of those people came to Venezuela to teach. We had this sort of exchange going on that was really neat. Warren came twice; Clary Illian came to teach after Warren did. I don’t remember who was next, but there were a number of people that came to teach. So there was just this connection between Venezuela and Minnesota. And since I’d been up here all this time—of course, when I’d come up to see Warren, I didn’t have a car, I didn’t have a whole lot of mobility—I might borrow his truck and go visit Linda, but I didn’t really get to know that much about this area; I was mostly there making pots. You know what? I think Minnesota Public Radio had a big part in it; just listening to that station gave me so much information about Minnesota and so much insight into the values of this community. I guess, now looking back, it was probably one of the factors. You know, compared to living in the Third World, if you had that juxtaposition—there’s so many things that I get the sense that people don’t really appreciate about living here. And Minnesota Public Radio was just one of those things that I think was just a wonderful resource. There’s always new information; there’s all kinds of programs, and you’re there at the wheel, making pots, listening to—it’s kind of like a continuing education.\\n00:44:23\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n13\\nAW: What were some of the insights you were learning, or values that were coming across, through MPR? What were some of the things that struck a chord with you?\\nGC: I’m trying to remember what the programs would have been, but just generally, so many people calling in with their concerns about their community and with the sense that actually something could be done, that there’s some possibility of improvement, you know? I think that in my experience in Venezuela, there’s kind of a fatalistic attitude that people have, that things are the way they are, and nothing’s going to change, so it really isn’t worth making the effort. You just have to find a way to navigate the system. That goes into this whole culture of corruption, and here it just didn’t seem to be that way. It seemed like people were calling in and saying, “Here’s this issue, and I’m concerned about it, and we should talk about it.” And then there’d be a program about it. Concerns about communities—you know, there are so many things about Minnesota that are really kind of interesting and intriguing: the immigrant communities. I was just looking at a list where Hmong is the, after Spanish and English—they were looking at the states and what the most frequently spoken language is—and in Minnesota, it’s Hmong. Isn’t that amazing? That embracing of these other communities? You know, I’d be on the plane and going to Peru and I’d be sitting next to somebody who happened to be from Minnesota, and they were going to volunteer at some something: an eye doctor who was working for free distributing glasses in poor communities. There seems to be a real sense of collaboration and volunteerism, which I thought was really admirable. I liked that whole sense of the importance of community.\\nAW: Well, speaking of that, how did you get to know about the Tour?\\nGC: I’d never been here during the Tour. I came up here in the summer; I was usually here in July, August. But I knew that it happened. I’d heard so much about it, but I’d never had that opportunity to come to it. Linda Christiansen and her husband Jeff and Laurie and I became very good friends over time, you know—they had been to Venezuela a couple of times, we’d done some traveling together, we’d been up here to visit them, been at their house, made pots together. So when we were looking for a place to move to in the U.S.—we looked other places: we went to New Mexico. Laurie had a college buddy there who really wanted her to move to that area because they were really close friends—and we also looked in Iowa. And Iowa was actually a very, very strong possibility because I’d loved Iowa, but for some reason—Laurie was a teacher, and she had to get teaching certification, and she couldn’t get it in Iowa, but she could here—just bureaucracy issues.\\nSo we decided that it had to be Minnesota. We just happened to be incredibly fortunate to get here at a time when the value of properties was going down. This bubble was beginning to deflate, but it hadn’t burst. This house had been reduced in price; it had been on the market for over a year and hadn’t sold. Laurie found it on the internet, and we came to see it. I couldn’t believe—I fell in love with the place. The house is, you know, it’s a house, but this general area here? I just didn’t dare dream that we could possibly do it, but we were able to get in and buy it. It was really surprising to me.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n14\\n00:50:05\\nAW: What attracted you about this area? Are you talking about the landscape? The environment?\\nGC: My expectations were that we were going to be able to get maybe a small farmhouse somewhere, and there would be a field and lots of corn, or you know; it was not going to be near the river and with a view. You saw the view from our bedroom where we lived in Venezuela. I thought, There’s no way we’re gonna get a view. We ended up finding this place, and Linda said—Linda was pretty excited—she said, “You know, that’s a great place for being on the Tour.” I had no expectation of being on the Tour, either; this was an established institution from a long time ago, and I was coming in from abroad without any—I had no idea. I mean, this was a completely new adventure to me. So for the first three years that I was making pots here—my first firing was in 2007—2007, 8, and 9, I was a guest at Linda’s studio on the Tour. The Tour rules are that you have to be a guest for three years. None of these rules, I think, are written down. I’ve never seen them written down, but this is what I hear: three years before anybody could consider anyone to become actually a host studio on the Tour. There used to be a potter on the Tour named Richard Abnet, who was just down the road a little ways, and he had retired from the Tour for health reasons and then, eventually, he passed away, and they hadn’t replaced him, so the Tour was down to six studios from the seven they had grown to include.\\nOne day, I don’t even remember who called—Laurie will probably remember who called—but they had gotten together at some point, and decided that they would have me as a host, accept me as part of the group. And that’s been wonderful. I mean, a really important platform for me and for seven other potters that I have here as guests: some local potters like Mike Norman, whom I first met at that sale at Warren’s—\\nAW: This was back in ’84?\\nGC: Yeah, in ’84.\\nAW: Who are some of the other guests?\\nGC: I have another guest, who is Dick Cooter from Two Harbors, and those are two Minnesota people. Then, I actually had Clary Illian as a guest one year. I thought that was very sweet. (Chuckles) Well, Randy Johnston and his wife Jan McKeachie have been guests here; now they’re guests at Linda’s. Simon Levin is a potter from Gresham, Wisconsin. Stephen Rolf, potter from River Falls. Delores Fortuna is a potter from Galena, Illinois. And Jim Lorio is from Boulder, Colorado. I think that’s it. Oh!—Sarah Jaeger, from Montana.\\nAW: That’s right, we talked to Sarah during the Tour when we were doing those studio interviews.\\nGC: That’s right. Mm-hmm.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n15\\nAW: So, besides Jim from Colorado and Sarah from Montana, most everyone is Midwest, and really Minnesota/Wisconsin, focused.\\nGC: Yeah, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and that’s partly because when I became a host, I had to think, Well, who am I going to have as guests, and who am I going to reach out to? And I didn’t know that many potters in the U.S.—I still don’t. I’m getting to know more people mostly because they come through here on the Tour. But I haven’t had an opportunity yet to go to many places in the U.S. and meet many people from other places.\\n00:55:32\\nAW: So how did you decide, then? What kind of criteria did you have in mind? Or did you just know some of these people?\\nGC: You know, it’s hard to be totally consistent about stuff. I want to give the people who make the kinds of pots that have the same intention as the pots that I make to have some sort of presence, so I do favor functional pots, but, you know, a lot of Mike’s stuff is not functional. It seems like, right now, the ceramic expression has moved a lot in the direction of more decorative work. I’m not saying that in any critical way, but there’s a lot more focus on really developing an individual’s expression, decoration—pots that are not just straight pots. So I’m trying to favor, if I can, people that are closer to making pots that are kind of unapologetic about being pots. And there’s a whole world of people that are doing that sort of thing. Beautiful, really wonderful stuff.\\nAt the same time, you want to have a diversity of stuff. There’s one thing that I learned or experienced, actually for the first time, at that sale at Warren’s, which was to mix all the pots together instead of having everyone with a separate booth with a separate group of pots and having each person standing in front of his stuff. We mix everything up. Well, you were here, so you saw how that sort of works and doesn’t work. But that’s different from every other place on the Tour. That’s kind of interesting. And I get feedback from people that tell me I’m not doing things right. (Laughs) At the same time I get feedback from people that say, “I really love it that you do that.” I understand that it’s more of a challenge for people because if you want to come and see Sarah Jaeger’s work, for example, you can’t just come to one spot and see it all and then buy the piece there that you want and take off. You have to go through the whole place if you want to see all of her work. And then in a sense you’re—forced is too strong a word—you’re exposed to things that you might not otherwise have made the time for. And you might, you might run into something kind of unique and special, something that calls to you. I think that’s fun. I understand that, for collectors, it’s more of a challenge. For the general public, I think it’s more fun. There’s more of a hunt.\\nAW: Mm-hmm. How about the visiting artists? What do they say about it?\\nGC: Well, (laughing) they don’t say much about it. I think people are—at least to me, there haven’t been any complaints. Maybe people are being polite, and they don’t want to complain. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n16\\nBut, you know, our results are good. Our sales are as good as we could—I don’t know—Bob says, “They’d be better if you did it my way.” I don’t know that. (Laughs) And I love Bob. I think he does a great job, and he’s done a really wonderful—he has a wonderful effect on the Tour. His enthusiasm, and his energy, has been just a great motor for the Tour.\\n[Later comment on this question from GC: I favor utilitarian work because there is a current trend toward “art pots”. Often highly decorated and where function is not a primary concern and I want to support “straight” potters. I value diversity because it makes it more fun for the pottery lovers that attend our event. It is critical that my guests understand that the Tour at my studio is more than a collection of individual potters. I require that all the pots be mixed together because we are together presenting the pots. The pots are the stars of this event.]\\n01:00:34\\nAW: By having the artists present their work all together, because everything is mixed together, do you think that kind of builds a camaraderie between them?\\nGC: Absolutely. Absolutely. To me, it’s all about having a community here doing everything for the benefit of the group and not just having a situation where people come and set up their own stuff, and then they go back to the hotel. Here we’re not done setting up until the last pot is out, whether its mine or whosoever’s it is. So we have to keep going and keep working at it. One comment I wanted to make, before I forget, was that also I believe that if you mix the pots up, they set each other off, and they look better. If you have a whole, huge table full of wood-fired pots, where you have these rich, beautiful wood-fired surfaces, but they’re all similar, and they’re all one next to the other, if you put one of Sarah Jaeger’s wonderful porcelain pieces, and then have that in between a couple of wood-fired pots, those wood-fired pots are going to just sing. They’re gonna look so much better. That contrast is so important, I think. You don’t have that possibility… There was something else that you were asking before that about mixing them all.\\nAW: Yeah, about mixing them all up, that that kind of process then brings all of the artists together—it sounds like everyone generally, at each studio, helps each other out. This way, it’s a little bit more involved.\\nGC: Yeah. It’s part of the process.\\nAW: So what are more parts of the process, getting the Tour set up here for your studio? How do you get things set up? What are some of the traditions you guys have for the studio?\\nGC: The Tour happens on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I start setting out surfaces on the Monday before. Every year I promise myself that I’m going to be ready earlier because there’s so much that happens, and it just happens to be my house, so everything that happens kind of has to go through me because people want to come up and ask me, “Is it okay if I do this? Is it okay if I do that?” It’s getting much better and much easier as time goes on and as we’ve done it A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n17\\nseveral times. Some of the guests pretty much —I know I couldn’t do it without them. Some people arrived on Tuesday because, the arrangement of the surfaces, we vary that just for fun so that the circulation patterns of people are a little different, and try to play with how they’re gonna move and which would be the best way to maybe try to induce people to get to this side of the house, which is the back of the house, and people aren’t so attracted to coming back here. So Tuesday we start getting those things out. And I try to get my pots out on Tuesday. Wednesday, everyone arrives, and then we have a welcome feast: make a paella and have just generally—you know, people are tired, they just unpack all of their pots and get a little bit done. But this Wednesday, this time, there were some potters that had already been there from Tuesday, and they got most of their stuff out. So then they can help facilitate for the ones that are arriving on Thursday, and things get finished up. Set-up gets finished up. Then Thursday, there’s a dinner at Connee’s, so you’ve gotta be done before that dinner, and then you want to go to bed fairly early because Friday is showtime; you’ve gotta get a good night’s sleep, if you can sleep. (Laughing) It just goes by so fast. There are so many things to do: you’ve got to put the signs up, you’ve gotta run down to the liquor store and pick up the kegs and get that set up, and go down to the gentleman we rent a golf cart from. I think the fact that I came in more or less recently gives me kind of the opportunity to have a fresher look at what we need to do. To me the golf cart was a no-brainer—I mean, having a shuttle, you know? People are willing to walk, and a lot of times people don’t want to get on the golf cart because they feel that’s not proper, or, you should walk—you got that. I mean, people like to ski uphill here, you know? (Laughing)\\n01:06:32\\nAW: Exactly. That’s very Minnesotan: “Ah, we’ll just walk.”\\nGC: So you have to cajole them. “Oh, come on, I’m--”\\nAW: --offering a ride. Are you not going to take it? (Laughs)\\nGC: Eventually, you get people on there. People come out with a couple of big bags of pots, and some people are older. So that, to me, seemed like a good idea, but it was viewed with a certain suspicion. It was kind of like, “Oh, I don’t know…” (Laughs) But it’s worked out pretty well.\\nAW: Because some driveways are pretty steep. You have a steep driveway, and Bob does, too.\\nGC: Linda’s got a long driveway.\\nAW: Yeah, like the Tour that happened this year when it was so rainy, I could imagine just that it’s better to be on the golf cart—\\nGC: —Yeah, to get back to the car—\\nAW: —than slipping with your new purchase. So the golf cart was one thing that you introduced to the group? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n18\\nGC: Yeah, I think that was my idea.\\nAW: Are there other things that you’re seeing with kind of a new perspective?\\nGC: I never would have thought of myself as being anything like involved in marketing or management or promotion or anything like that, but I got invited to be part of the marketing committee, which is Bob, Will Swanson, and me, which basically means we get together and have a couple of beers and talk. (Laughs) So that’s where a lot of those ideas come up. We talk about how things—what would make it better.\\nAW: Is there a favorite bar you guys go to?\\nGC: Yeah, we go to Al’s in Center City a lot. I mean, we don’t go a lot, but that’s the place we go most often. Al is a glassblower, so he’s got his bar as a sideline or his glassblowing as a sideline—I don’t know which is which. But yeah, it’s a nice little place.\\nAW: Are there some marketing ideas that have come up since you’ve joined that could help the Tour? Or, how does marketing play a role in the Tour?\\nGC: A lot of it has to do with things that are beginning to evolve a little bit like, What are we to do about social media, electronic media, email? There didn’t used to be an email list. Now we’re actually actively taking emails and sending emails out. Social media: Facebook page, Likes, posting stuff—how do you actually get people to post things, you know?\\nAW: Is there a page for the Tour?\\nGC: Yeah.\\nAW: Who goes on? Do all of you go on there and post stuff, and like stuff, etc.?\\nGC: Yeah, there’s several of us that are administrators so we can post stuff. But I think even if you’re not, you can share things on the page. We try to get the potters that are coming as guests to share what they’re doing to prepare for the Tour on that page. Some of them are more media-savvy than others. Some of them don’t have—(Laughs) you know, it’s just all over the place.\\n01:10:20\\nAW: Mm hmm.\\nGC: But it’s really neat, I think, because people really respond when they start seeing pots in process, and a firing coming out, and these are pots going to the Tour. You start getting a little bit of a buzz going on: “The Tour’s coming up!” I think that’s been really a good deal. There’s just a lot that can be done, and of course we’re all primarily potters and we all have to make A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n19\\npots—you almost need to have a full-time job to have people be able to do all that you could be doing to get the word out. But I think things are getting better. For example, I’m going to the Mill City Farmers Market. I’ve been doing that for this, I think, is my fourth year. This summer I’ll be there four times. It’s not really that great a place for me to sell pots—I sell some. But it’s a fabulous place to connect with a really good clientele. So I take flyers from this year’s tour, and get a chance to talk to a lot of people: “Have you been on the Tour?” You’d be surprised how few people—general public—they don’t really know about it. There’s a whole world of people out there that could still be made aware that this exists. People move away, for some reason or other they drop out and they stop coming, so you always have to be getting new people interested. People get to the point where they can’t fit another pot in their houses. I get a lot of that when I talk to these people. And I make this joke that, “Yeah, I’m going to start selling shelving units, as well, with the pots because you need a place to put them.” You need to connect with people that are younger people that are starting out, maybe, that are moving into an apartment, that need a few cups.\\nAW: And do you think social media might be a way to do that, too?\\nGC: I think so.\\nAW: Who are you guys looking at with the Facebook page? Is it the younger audience? Is it regular visitors?\\nGC: There are some savvy older people, and then there are a lot of young people. And then I hear that a lot of young people are moving away from Facebook, that it’s no longer the place to go, and I worry. I’m just getting clued into Facebook, and now I’m gonna have to figure out where we go from here.\\nAW: The next social media site.\\nGC: Yeah. And we’ve been using Minnesota Public Radio, which I think is absolutely perfect. That’s exactly the audience that’s going to be interested in pots.\\nAW: When you have people post pictures or news about putting stuff in the kiln, to me it seems like a way that people could learn about the process and be somewhat involved in the process. Do you feel like that, too, is a way to bring people into the process a bit, to help them get excited about it because they’re hearing about the different stages?\\nGC: What I can say is that when I post things about—I’ll show you my personal page, but, let’s see, here’s my pottery page—(shows Facebook page on computer)\\nAW: So you’re posting, too, as well as your guest artists.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n20\\nGC: I have my own page, which I keep posting on. These are glazed casseroles. Next weekend, at St. Anthony Park, there’s an art fair, and I’ll be there. So I’m putting up a few things about the St. Anthony Park Art Fair. Here’s some pictures of the Tour, here.\\n01:15:45\\nAW: That’s definitely not on Friday, when we were here. Must have been on Sunday?\\nGC: Can you imagine that?\\nAW: When we were there it was raining. Gorgeous photo of you and the group!\\nGC: And the group, mm-hmm. I don’t know what this means here when they say that this post “was served to”; it used to be “was viewed by” or “opened by” or something like that. Now it says it’s “served to”—I don’t know what that means, but—it’s fifteen hundred people. That’s something, an activity, and these were some pots that were coming out. So these things really attract attention, a lot of people looking at them. 849 people looking at the first pots I put out in the springtime to dry for the Tour? 1,080 people looked at these baking dishes. People really like to see something that’s happening. Like: there was a little tiny clip of a video that a friend of mine took—or, Laurie took—of me glazing a bowl; a huge number of people wanted to take a look at it. When you put something like “Spiritworks Pottery,” 148 people saw it. It’s still me posting something about pots, but people aren’t really that interested in looking at—The “Yunomi Invitational” [Japanese style drinking cup]. This is at the Akar Gallery in Iowa; it’s the biggest Yunomi event in the country, in the year, so I’m promoting it there, I have some pots there, 116 people saw it. Those things people aren’t that interested in. They’re really interested in seeing the actual process. And St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour—this is the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour page, so there’s also a page that’s St. Croix Valley Potters’ Tour. This was at Will Swanson’s. Then, I shared mine with that one, too. And then these were some pieces from potters before the Tour here: somebody’s packing a kiln. And this page has about 1,600 “Likes,” so then that goes out to this 1,600 people, and maybe they spread the word, share it. They liked it, so they’re the people that you really want to have that information.\\nAW: Do you think it has made a difference in how many people are attending?\\nGC: Well, we get more people every year. It’s hard to tell why. I tried to do a survey, but surveys are really not that easy to do. To do a really good survey, to get a lot of people, you actually need to get somebody that’s just doing that and maybe interviewing people, trying to get information. We are getting more people, but I don’t know how much of it is this? How much of it is MPR? And this year there wasn’t that much more than last year, so who knows? We’re just potters, you know, and most of us don’t really want to spend a whole lot of time doing that kind of thing.\\nAW: Who are some of the people who come to visit your studio?\\nGC: During the Tour? A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n21\\nAW: Mm-hmm. Are they from around this area? Are they from the Cities? Are they from the Midwest? Or are they from all over the world? Where are they coming from, and are they families, or couples, friends, students?\\n01:20:15\\nGC: There are families, couples, friends, students—there’s just everything. There are young people. There are people that are coming from Bemidji, from a school group of ceramics students. They come down here and they want to see the studio, and they want to do a little tour. There was something I was going to say that was—oh, you were asking about the number of people that come and where they come from—let’s see, we started to take zip codes to find out more or less where people were coming from. I had people from twenty-four states come through this studio—not this year, but last year. This year I haven’t checked that. And a few other countries: there were people from Chile, I know there’ve been people from France. I don’t know who was here this year, but people do come from abroad. Just to get people from half the states in the United States almost to come out here, it’s a big deal.\\nI’m involved with an organization that’s right now based in Stillwater called ArtReach St. Croix. Its mission is to make the St. Croix Valley a national destination for arts and culture. They’re all about promoting and marketing arts and culture in the St. Croix Valley from Taylor’s Falls and St. Croix Falls down to Hastings and Prescott—that section of the river. They have a website called the St. Croix Splash where you can go and see what events are going on and what’s posted for the rest of the year. You can put in a date; if you happen to have family coming in from somewhere else in the country, you can see what’s happening that weekend, whether it's the Festival Theater, whether it’s Franconia, whether it’s farmers markets, wine tastings, music, concerts, pottery sales, all these events, theater—it’s all in this one resource. I think it’s really productive to try to get this area known for that because it’s incredibly rich. It’s amazing when you start looking. If you go to St. Croix Splash and you start looking at all of the things that are going on at one time, it’s pretty amazing. People talk about Door County—Door County has generated that kind of image of being a culture area—and I think that’s what the Tour contributes greatly to. We’re bringing so many people into this area from all over, but it’s something that only happens once in the year. But there are so many things going on the rest of the year, and of course we’re here the rest of the year, so we’d like to continue to have people come into the studio and buy pots or whatever. (Laughs)\\nAW: Is there something unique about this area that draws so many artists or cultural events?\\nGC: Well there’s the river. The river is a huge thing. There’s an incredibly beautiful natural environment, and that makes a huge impact.\\nAW: How so?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n22\\nGC: It’s just the context. Well, this is what happened to us in Venezuela: we had our pottery sale outside Venezuela [Caracas], we couldn’t make enough pots—we’d sell everything. We were given the opportunity to have a very nice small house in the city with a nice clay tile roof. It was a very sweet little place. We fixed it up, and we had a little courtyard and plants, and we did all kinds of activities there. We had shows, we had our store, always somebody there taking care of it; workshops, events of all different kinds. And we had the pots at the same prices as we had them out at my place, and you didn’t have to drive, you know, sixty miles down a death-defying little road with cliffs on either side, and we just couldn’t really move the pots very well. You’d sell some pots, but it wasn’t the same response. I think the context of being out in an area where there are no distractions and where it’s a beautiful place to be and you’re happy to be there, it makes such a difference in just being able to appreciate. So I think people associate the work with the place. You can imagine—have you been to Franconia Sculpture Park?\\n01:26:03\\nAW: Mm-hmm.\\nGC: Have you been there for concerts? That’s kind of fun. You should do that this summer; they have really good music. Then, you know, just to be in a really nice place and bring your picnic basket or little cooler and have a beer and listen to some good music—it just becomes a really charming situation. I think that has a great impact. So the context is huge, I think.\\nAW: And what about the potters involved in the Tour? Has the Tour made this place known as a cultural hub, or is there something unique about the group of potters involved in the Tour?\\nGC: Well, they’re very good potters. I think there’s a priority of making very good work. I don’t know if I’m saying that the way I intend it to sound. But it’s more important to make good pots than to have a big sale. The sale is a consequence of having some really good work that’s being made. I think that’s really important. If you have a very good sale, but you don't have really very good work—I think that quality has really been important to create that image of the Tour.\\nAW: The high quality of work?\\nGC: I think having very well-respected potters from all over the United States obviously helps immeasurably, too. You have people that come from all over the U.S. On our invitation this year, there’s a map of the country and lines to where all the potters come from, and I don’t remember how many different states are represented by the potters, but it’s many. The fact that they want to come here, and their work is of very good quality and they’re recognized—all of that is of mutual benefit: the Tour benefits, and they obviously come here and sell a lot of work. So it’s good for everybody.\\nAW: Mm-hmm.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n23\\nGC: It’s interesting because there is a thought, quite often, in all areas but among artists that if someone sells a piece, then that’s one less piece that I can sell, you know?—kind of that sense that you don’t want to have too many people because then the sales will be less. It’s actually the opposite: the more you offer, the bigger your market becomes and the bigger your audience becomes. I think in the beginning, there were no guests at all, so there were seven potters. This year we had fifty-one potters. And the amount of sales, I’m sure it has not decreased for those seven. I’d have to ask, but I think it’s probably gone well above what they used to sell. It just becomes that much more interesting for people, so you get so many more people to come out.\\n01:30:15\\nAW: What was it like when you were invited to be a host on the Tour? What was it like coming into the group? What was that first year like for you—in 2010?\\nGC: Yeah, I had already been at Linda’s as a guest, so I had some idea what the Tour event would be like. It’s always kind of scary. The Tour itself, I always feel here, that it’s just a barely controlled chaos. It’s just almost falling apart all the time. Just trying to be ready and make sure that nothing is going to go wrong is kind of scary, and also not wanting to let anybody else down by doing something inappropriate in some way, you know? I mean I speak English, and I’ve spoken English all my life, so I sound like I know, but I haven’t ever lived in the U.S.—or hadn’t ever lived in the U.S. before—so there were a lot of things that, culturally, were totally clueless. Like I had no idea that some things might be misinterpreted. They’re small things, but they all add up. Maybe it was more in my mind and in my head than in reality, I’m not really sure. But to me, it was a great opportunity and I wanted it to work. One thing that’s really interesting about this group, too, and it’s very charming and wonderful, is that they’re seven separate studios that operate totally independently. There are some ground rules, some rules that are rules, like: only ceramics; there’s not supposed to be anything other than pots for sale. But aside from that, you could have one guest or you could have no guests. The maximum is eight. I think you can have eight, like Bob. (Laughs) I think Jeff is the one who’s most—he’ll have maybe two or three guests. And what you decide to do—you know, this year, three studios decided to have food trucks, which is a new thing. We did something very similar to that in Venezuela. It worked out very well for us in Venezuela. But this is a completely different culture and a different place, so who knows? I’m really interested to hear what people say about that in our meeting.\\nAW: Now, because we were here, you had some food that you served—it was all very delicious—did you make that? Or did people bring stuff and contribute?\\nGC: That’s one thing that’s really an important point. We couldn’t possibly do this without all these people that come to help. Most of them are just volunteering because they think it’s a fun event, and they want to contribute to something that’s kind of exciting and fun, and in the end they end up getting some, maybe, pots as a gift—but absolutely nothing that is equivalent to the amount of effort that they put in to make it happen. I require that all the guests bring one person as a helper because the artists themselves are supposed to be available to talk to the public all the time; they’re not supposed to be doing any work—any schlepping, or driving the golf cart, or A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n24\\nanything like that. They’re supposed to be standing around, and if anybody wants to engage with them, they have to be there for that. So they need to have somebody that’s there that will help with the setup, that’ll help with wrapping pots and bagging pots and the checkout and everything. Then there’s a whole bunch of people that are local—friends of ours and people that have decided that they want to be part of the situation. Because the checkout is sensitive, you know; you’re managing all this money and using a computer program so you’re inputting information, and you have to try to minimize human error because that error just makes it harder to reconcile and do all the work. These are people that work very hard. And in the kitchen, there’s one person who has been a caterer in her life—she works at a co-op in the Cities—and she’s extremely professional at making food. There’s some really good amateurs. Then, there’s a woman who’s the manager of one of the best restaurants in the Cities—she actually did art in school—and she enjoys being part of the art scene, and she’s, you know, just fabulous in the kitchen. So we have these people in the kitchen that are unbelievable. A lot of kids that help carry food in and out, help chop, help do this and help do that, wash dishes—we have somebody washing dishes permanently. I like to use my own pots, I like to make pots—and actually next year, I’m hoping that a couple of the other potters that are my guests will also contribute some of their own pots to serve the food because, the first time we had the sale, we had eight or ten contractor bags of garbage—these huge bags of plastic and paper and spoons and cups, and it was like, “This is totally the wrong message.” We’re making pots partly because we want something that is going to be reused and it’s going to be appreciated, and this, that, and the other. I said, “Okay, I’m gonna make some beer tumblers, like those things, the smaller wine cup, a bowl, and a plate, and we’re gonna just use that stuff.” I didn’t think I was going to sell them, I was just going to make a bunch and we would have them and we would use them, but as soon as people got ’em in their hands, they, especially the wine cups for some reason, they’ve just gotta have ’em. So by the middle of Saturday, there were no wine cups left. That’s why I’m telling Jim Lorio and Dick [Cooter] and these other people, “Listen, would you guys make a few of these, too?” We need to have twice as many next year so that we don’t have to go back to the paper cups. It’s a little more work; people have to wash and then put them back out again and all that, but it’s so neat. You wouldn’t believe how many people ask me, “Can you use this stuff?”\\n01:38:42\\nAW: Yeah, I remember on that Friday afternoon, we were getting ready to leave, and there were a couple of people trying to find matching wine tumblers and trying to get those together to buy them, and (Laughing) I’m not surprised they were all sold out by the following day.\\nGC: The thing is, they’re a little fussy to make; they’re little, and I want to make something else, I don’t want to just make hundreds of those. But it really is nice to see people using them.\\nAW: So what do you do to prepare for the Tour? What is your own process, and how many things do you make? When do you start producing things for the Tour? Can you walk us through that?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n25\\nGC: Well, this year I had a workshop, so I was gone most of January. But really what I should be doing is, by the end of December, start[ing] to accumulate inventory. But you always have plans to do all of these things, and I talk to my guests, and, you know, life intervenes. There’s always something that happens and you don’t get quite as much work done as you would like. It’s basically about spending the winter making pots. There’s a lot of work, a lot of it that Laurie does, with mailing list work. We mail—I’m trying to remember how many; it was in the high twenties—maybe 28,000 flyers. Those mailing lists have to compiled and duplicates and all of this work. People send in mailing lists, and all of that has to be put together. There are a few deadlines to get that flyer designed, but Will Swanson’s been doing that in the last few years: the design of the flyer. What else do we have to do?\\nAW: Is this the first sale that you have for the season? Or is there something before this?\\nGC: I actually had one the weekend before in Osceola, which is a very small sale. It’s at a place called The Art Barn, and it’s a show called The Friends Show. There’s a painter who focuses on the St. Croix River called Jim Dimmers and a pair of jewelers, also from Wisconsin, and a woman from Marine on St. Croix who does fiberwork and cards, paper and stuff. I like to do that because my whole eventual goal is to generate enough of a local audience that I’ll get people [to] come during the year if they need a wedding gift or a birthday present or a cup or whatever, to have them come by. That’s why I do that one. I do the Marine Art Fair, and I do another one in Taylor’s Falls, so I do three shows that are kind of local around here. And this year there’s one, going to be happening at Scandia, that has to do with their farmer’s market. Because there’s enough of a population around here that if you got people to be aware and conscious that instead of going on Amazon and ordering something, they could just come—(Laughing) me and my marketing genius, right? But yeah, I’d rather do that than go to Philadelphia or have shows in different areas nationally.\\nAW: So you go to about three or four in this year’s shows, plus this tour, so five?\\nGC: That, and then in the Cities there’s Mill City [Farmers Market], there’s the St. Anthony Park event, there’s a place called the White Bear Center for the Arts, and there’s going to be an event there in July. I keep telling myself I’ve gotta stop doing quite so many. And I really do have to do that. I want to spend more time in the studio making pots and just getting a little more relaxed rhythm going to life. It’s been really busy trying to get everything to work at this point, and now I think I get this sense that now I can take a little bit more time to make pots and less time carrying pots around. I’m looking forward to that.\\n01:44:18\\nAW: When you were in Venezuela, were you also doing a lot of art fairs, plus the sale that you hosted, too? What was that like there?\\nGC: Mostly, I didn’t. Mostly I did those two sales. Then we did one or two here and there, and an occasional show, but really, our Encuentro was what we all worked towards. Since it A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n26\\nhappened twice a year, it was good—it balanced. I’m trying to do that now here: to have a fall sale, which I’m trying to promote. Actually, Linda’s going to be a guest, and a couple of other people—actually Jim from Boulder: Jim Lorio. And there’s a woman who works with a group of weavers from Peru called Melanie Ebertz—her place is Art Andes. Melanie works with these weavers, and a percentage of all the sales goes to a foundation and helps provide food for kids in schools in Peru. She’s going to be part of our fall sale. Since it’s my fall sale, I can do whatever I want, so I’m gonna have somebody that’s not a potter. I’m going to have a guest that’s not a potter at all of my fall sales.\\nLast year, there’s this event that Art Reach has organized—it’s called Take Me to the River—and there are a number of events that happen on the last two weekends in September, the second half of September. There’s a number—there’s Afton Art Fair, Franconia has some events, the Festival Theater has some, Marine Art Fair, in Stillwater I think they call it Log Jam Days now, so there’s a number of events. And they set up a tent at each one of these events, and they tried to get people to go to the other ones. They promote and they make a rack card and brochure, and they do a bunch of stuff—I’m part of that, and that’s really increased the number of people that have come by here during the fall sale. So the idea is to try to balance it out so you don’t just have this one big sale in the spring and then, by the time you get around to January, it’s starting to get really (Laughing) really tight.\\nAW: When you’re producing stuff in the winter, are you making enough stuff to carry you through the summer season? Or do you continue to be making your work throughout the summer?\\nGC: I have to keep working. Right now, I’m worried about going to St. Anthony Park next weekend and not having, really, a whole lot of stuff. The Tour was a pretty big deal, and since I was gone in January, I hadn’t been able to make as much as I—and then, you know, I have to say, “Well, but then you went to the Boundary Waters.” So I’m not complaining. I’m just thinking that if I hadn’t gone to the Boundary Waters, I’d be getting to a firing right about now, so I’d have more pots. Anyway, that’s that idea that maybe I need to just accept that I’m not going to make quite as many pots, and accept fewer commitments. In the past it was just really important for me to get out there and be out there and have my pots out there, and people would come up to me and say, “I see your name everywhere!” It’s kind of embarrassing; it’s kind of like, “Oh my God, what am I doing?” But this is it. I don’t have a Plan B: I need to sell those pots and make a living.\\nAW: Do you find it also helps you connect to local communities around here? To meet your neighbors and everything?\\nGC: Oh, absolutely. Yeah.\\nAW: And that seems to be something important to you.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n27\\nGC: To me, yeah, absolutely. And the small things—like this Art Barn—because there are less people that come, you get more of a chance to talk to them. Then you realize that you have connections, that they know somebody that you know, and you begin to become a little more a part of the community. They say, you know, you’re always the new person; your kids may end up being from here (Laughs), but it takes forever to become more part of the community.\\nAW: Speaking of that, where are your kids now?\\nGC: They went to college, they graduated from college. Our daughter works at a non-profit in Chicago that’s an art school for disadvantaged kids.\\nAW: What’s her name?\\nGC: Her name is Alana.\\nAW: How do you spell that?\\nGC: A-l-a-n-a. It’s a really neat school; it’s called Marwen—M-a-r-w-e-n. They have a great program. They have teachers that come in from all over that come and do classes in photography, printing, different kinds of visual arts, some ceramics—they’re limited by their facilities right now, but they have this wonderful building and a gallery space, and they have shows, and the kids really respond. It’s really neat. So she’s very happy with that. But she’s getting a little sick of living in Chicago.\\n01:50:43\\nAW: Did she go to college in Chicago?\\nGC: She went to college in Ohio. Both of them went to school at a college called Wooster in Wooster, Ohio.\\nAW: So nobody went for Cornell for a third generation?\\nGC: No. No, and I’m happy with that. I didn’t tell them what to study, either. It didn't work for my dad, so I figured, Why waste the time?\\nAW: And your son?\\nGC: He actually lives in Marine [on St. Croix]. He got out of school and did a VISTA program for awhile, and then came back here. Of course, he didn’t want to stay here—he got some work in a restaurant, first here in Wisconsin, and then he got involved with this restaurant in Marine, which is called the Brookside. It’s a bar and grill, but it’s a really nice bar and grill, and it’s a really nice group of people that work there and run the place. And now he’s got a small share, so A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n28\\nhe’s kind of a partner, so now he’s got all the headaches of being the one that has to manage the place. But yeah, it’s nice to have him nearby.\\nAW: And what’s his name?\\nGC: Carlos.\\nAW: Have they had experience with pottery, ceramics?\\nGC: Yeah, they made pots when they were little kids, playing with the clay and stuff, and then, occasionally, a little something, but not really. I didn’t ever really push that on them. And they didn’t particularly—now my daughter’s taking ceramics classes in Chicago. I find that kind of amusing! (Laughs)\\nAW: Is that through work?\\nGC: No, not through work. Just for fun, yeah.\\nAW: What has she had to say about it?\\nGC: Oh, she enjoys it. All she’s said is that she ha a great time and that it’s a lot of fun. (Laughing)\\nAW: Speaking of your parents, did they—\\nGC: —No art in the background.\\nAW: It didn’t sound like it. What about when it looked like it was beginning to become your career?\\nGC: I think, eventually, my dad eventually was kind of—he couldn’t understand it, but there were a lot of people that he kind of admired because they were involved in the—how do I say this?—people that were wealthy and educated in Venezuela, he had dealings with a lot of those people because they were also the owners of a lot of the farms where he was actually representing this dairy equipment from the United States, so he had milking machines and he’d come back to the Midwest and buy dairy cattle and ship them back to Venezuela—so he had this relationship with people that were well-educated and, financially, they were the economy, kind of, of the country, and they were showing up at shows where I was part of a group show or something like that. And it was kind of like, “Well, maybe there’s something there, I just don’t have a clue.” So I think he began to come around a little bit towards the end. And of course my mom now thinks everything is just incredible. And Laurie’s mom has been fantastic; she’s just a really wonderful booster and supporter. I don’t know if I mentioned that Laurie’s sister is a papermaker—she’s an extraordinary papermaker—and I think that Terry’s really proud of us doing this. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n29\\n01:55:35\\nAW: Now, what did Laurie study in college?\\nGC: Biology. Then she got a master’s in education, so she was teaching second/third grade.\\nAW: And where did she grow up?\\nGC: Mason City, Iowa.\\nAW: Has she also worked with clay? Sometimes you’ve referred to both of you making pottery, so I wonder how that’s worked?\\nGC: She has. Yeah, we’ve done some things, and she has worked with clay, but not so much recently. Since we came to the States, first she taught for a year, and then she’s really been basically doing everything that I don’t do that has to do with the pottery: photography, Photoshop, designing cards, mailing lists—all of that—just a huge amount of work. If she weren’t doing that, I just couldn’t possibly make enough pots. That’s a pretty big job.\\nAW: Mm-hmm. So you met at Cornell your first year?\\nGC: Mm-hmm.\\nAW: And then through all of your traveling, too, you stayed in touch? Or did you reconnect once you went back to Cornell to finish your degree?\\nGC: Well, there was a kind of a hiatus. I was not particularly good at writing letters or staying in contact, but there was some contact—enough contact, I guess, that eventually when I came back, we started to go out again. It hadn’t ever officially ended, but it had been kind of in a state of suspended animation. (Laughs)\\nAnd one thing I haven’t mentioned at all is that in 1984, or ’83, I went up to California and talked to a guy called Bill Abbott, who had lived in Venezuela, and he was the owner of a company called Wilderness Travel. I started to guide trips for them in Venezuela. These were wilderness trips: trekking and canoeing—dugout canoes with the Indians, traveling through the base of Angel Falls and hiking up to the top of these tabletop mountains in Southeast Venezuela—really, very, incredibly beautiful area. And there were trips that were anywhere from eighteen to twenty-one days long, in the beginning, and I was absolutely chief cook and bottle-washer. So I would be drying food, drying veggies, and doing all of the packing, and then driving. It was a two-day drive to get down to where the trek began in order to communicate with the Indians and tell them that we were coming (because we would need porters and we would need an assistant). And there was no way to communicate with them other than taking four days and just going down there and talking to them, giving them the date, and hoping that A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n30\\nwhen you got there, they were there—and chartering small planes that would fly us from one area to the other area where we got into the dugouts, and also getting in touch with that set of Indians on that end that were related but not the same, and picking people up at the airport, dealing with lost bags, getting all of the local tickets, all the travel arrangements done. It was a huge job, and extremely scary, in the beginning, for me to have a group of twelve to fifteen people that were just coming in and you were in charge of making sure that everything worked. That really was a good training for the Tour; the Tour really is a piece of cake compared to that. I’m just getting kind of old and lazy, but back in those days, I would have to get up before everybody else, get the coffee ready and start making breakfast, you know, under a ledge somewhere on the top of this mountain. And, you know, people would get sick; you were in charge of them, figuring out what to do with them, and it was incredible. It was fabulous. People had a great time. It was just a wonderful, and probably still is, an incredible place in the world. I started doing that in ’84, and then for about ten years—until about ’94—I was doing that once or twice or three times a year. And that had a big effect on the pots. I didn’t think that it would have much of an effect because you’re taking maybe two, three months off; the rest of the year you’re making pots. But I didn’t know how else to deal with that because I was getting paid in dollars to do that and then, at the exchange rate, that was a lot of money, so it was a significant way of making some additional income. But during that time, instead of remaining in the same place as far as your work is concerned, you lose the momentum, and you lose the ideas that you are working with, and when you come back to it, you kind of backslide, and you have to try to start thinking about, What was I doing? Basically, a lot of things go by the wayside and you never really get back to them because you kind of lose them. For those people who feel that they need to have another day job in order to support their pottery, I think it has a big effect. There’s no way that you can avoid it having a big effect, and it did for a long time.\\nBut I kept doing that, and then when Venezuela started going down the tubes, my friend Terry took me down to Patagonia and trained me up down there, and so I started guiding for Wilderness Travel in Patagonia in Argentina and Chile. And then my mom moved to Peru, so I was able to get myself into leading trips on the Inca Trail: Machu Picchu and Cuzco and that sort of thing. So I did that for a few years. And I did that for a few years after I moved to the U.S. Well, 2008, you know, when the market kind of tanked, a lot of these trips began to really slow down, and Wilderness Travel has a lot of guides that are in place—like in Cuzco in Peru, there are three Wilderness Travel guides that live there—so they were able to handle all of the remaining trips; so I was not getting work anymore. But there was so much work happening here, with the pottery, that it was almost a relief, you know? I was able just to stay focused on making pots. I’m really happy not to be leading trips anymore. It was a lot of fun—I’ve taken some friends, I’ve taken some potters, on trips; I’d love to do that: trips that I design and that are going to focus on the things that I’m interested in, creative things: textiles and ceramics and food. I mean, what could be better?\\n02:04:12\\nAW: Well, I’m glad we’ve come back to Venezuela because I’m curious, in the early part of your career, what kinds of influences came out of Venezuela or came out of some of the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n31\\ncommunities that you were meeting through these travels? Would you say that there were certain artistic or cultural influences that were in your pottery?\\nGC: Very, kind of vague, really. The Indians definitely had an effect—their work. I make some big platters that are almost a literal representation of a basket; I try to give them a texture that looks like it. I also have some kind of feeling that I try to put into my pots that relates to—but it’s mostly the intention, you know, the way that the Indians related to their work. There weren’t any real sources of influence or inspiration or whatever you call that in contemporary Venezuelan work. Not really for me. It was mostly that native stuff.\\nAW: What about being outside and doing the guiding and going to some really incredible natural resources like Angel Falls or places like that—plus just exploring around—what did that mean for you? You’ve also said that, here, the context of this environment is important for the Tour, so did the context of getting out and traveling around, did that also influence you?\\nGC: Nature—well, I don’t know if it was influence, but it was something that just was very important to me, and very moving. You know, diving, coral reefs, that sort of thing, blow your mind. I mean, the richness of the color in that sort of experience is fantastic. And we got into birds: Laurie and I were involved with the Audubon Society in Venezuela, and we led bird trips and stuff like that. Venezuela has almost twice as many birds as the continental United States, and Venezuela is a country the size of Texas maybe. The Amazon, the richness and diversity of the tropical environments, it’s just incredible. So birding was really just—these crazy things, these birds like the ones you see on the television, they were just “Who invented that?” sort of thing. And the same with the insect life.\\nSo when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life, I did this little book thing that kind of helps you go through and try to focus on what it is that’s important to you. Art and nature were basically the two. Any spirituality was sort of like an extension of nature to me. It was those three things, but art and nature really were the two central elements that were most important to me. I don’t know how that effects my work except that I want my pots to look like they really are clay. I talked to a very good friend of mine who’s a designer, and he said, “It doesn't matter what the material is, you know, it’s the design. You can use concrete, you can use wood, you can use plastic, anything—it doesn’t matter. It’s the design.” And that’s a designer talking, but I can’t feel that way. I want the nature of the material itself to come through, and it’s that dialogue between my intentions to impose my will on it and its reluctance to accept—that little tension in there, I think, is really important. One thing that I try to do very often—well, different kinds of techniques, but—I try to make my pots look old. Even when they’re coming fresh out of the kiln, I want them to look like somebody dug ’em up or it’s a found object or something like that. I don’t want them to look bright, shiny, and new. Those (gestures to cups) have a slip underneath them that crackles, and then the glaze fills the crackle over, but it looks kind of like old, cracked leather. Maybe these don’t show it so much because it was thin, but there are other pots where it shows better. There’s another technique that’s salt firing or soda firing, which is a new kiln that I’m starting to fire now. It’s an old technique, it’s a medieval European technique, of throwing salt into a kiln when it’s hot, and the salt vaporizes and the A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n32\\nsodium coats everything and it glazes everything—you know those old, grey, salt beer steins? Those are traditionally salt-glaze. I like to use those just to give the pots a timeless kind of a thing—it’s not like they’re new right now.\\n02:10:38\\nAW: Has your work changed since coming to St. Croix?\\nGC: Yeah, I think it has. Part of it has to do with actually making a lot of pots. I’ve been working full time, pretty much—I did some trips, and I have gone back to see my mom, and I’ve done some workshops—but since I’ve been here, I’ve had an average of one firing a month. So that’s 220, 250, pots a month, which would be 3,000 pots a year. Just that continuous work has been incredible. Also, being here, I’m not just imagining the pots that all these other potters are making that I admire, but I’m actually walking around and seeing them, so there’s a real interaction. It’s enriching to have that interaction with other people, and see everybody’s pots. Go down to the Northern Clay Center, and there’s shows; the old stuff at the MIA, you know? So, yeah, it’s been really enriching to be in the middle of all this stuff that’s really happening—the pots themselves. In Venezuela, I felt a little isolated, like I didn’t really have an opportunity to see a lot of stuff. I’d read magazines, and wait and hope for the next magazine to come out and be able to see a few pictures of some pots that people were making. Here, Minnesota is one of the richest areas of ceramics—it’s an extremely rich area of ceramics—in the whole world, really, so there’s a lot of stuff to see.\\nAW: And why is that, do you think?\\nGC: I think Warren probably had something to do with it. I wasn’t here, and I don’t feel totally entitled to be so certain about things, but it seems to me that Warren came here, and there wasn't much here when he came. He started making pots and pushing pots and doing demos and teaching and, eventually, working at the university and having really talented people get excited about pots. And people like Mark Pharis, who became a professor at the University of Minnesota, and all of these people—Randy Johnson’s teaching at the university in River Falls—so many of these people have been teaching and have had students that have infused this are with that enthusiasm for clay to be a valid creative expression. So I think it’s snowballed. And then there’s this incredibly supportive community: all of these people that have learned to love pots. They turn out, you know. You were here on Friday, and Friday was a miserable day, and people come out. They’re not going to be put off by a little weather. Yeah, it’s pretty amazing.\\n02:15:18\\nAW: Just curious: how has weather influenced the Tour, or not?\\nGC: It’s always a reason for a little bit of anxiety because another thing that we do is we have all the pots outside. I don’t want to have a bunch of tents. The pots look so good out in the sunshine, or even if it’s cloudy, they look just wonderful if they’re outside in natural light. This year, we A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n33\\nbought a bunch of umbrellas; we had several dozen umbrellas out there for people to use if they needed them. But it hasn’t forced us yet to change. The scariest thing that happened this year was when Laurie started talking about hail. What happens if there’s hail, and you’ve got several thousand pots out there? How quickly can you put them under the surfaces?\\nAW: It’s true! (Laughing) Maybe snow is not the biggest threat—\\nGC: —I wonder if I should look into some insurance. (Laughs) Hail damage on the pots!\\nAW: Hail damage for outdoor art shows, I wonder.\\nGC: Because it would be a really significant hit. Really. But let’s not dwell on that too much.\\nAW: Hopefully next one will be warm and sunny.\\nGC: You know, the first three years, when I was a guest at Linda’s, it was always wet, miserable, and cold. And then the first couple of years that I did it here, it was wet, miserable, and cold. Then, I think it was three years ago, we had this fabulous, wonderful, warm, beautiful [weather], and people wouldn’t leave. We ran out of food—we had to run down to Costco real quick (Laughs) because people were just hanging out. It was great, it was wonderful. It’s really nice when it can be nice weather. And I do think about it. We put up some tents so that people can find a place to stand under if it’s rainy. The wind is always a concern because sometimes you have to stand there and hang onto the tents because they want to pick up and fly away. But I’m not sure how to resolve that yet.\\nAW: For all of the people coming through, it would be really hard to have it all inside. That’s what makes it fun is having it outside and walking around the area and being part of that natural environment and just soaking it up.\\nGC: One of the things that we did that I mentioned at the beginning and we haven’t talked about any further is that we were able to buy this lot next door. It’s all flat and open. It’s a beautiful, beautiful spot over there with a view over to Wisconsin and the bluffs over the river, and I have these fantasies that the Tour could happen over there, and I’m not sure. Maybe just having a big roof, and then setting up just around the roof so that people could have everything like the food and the checkout and sitting area and everything like that under the roof, but the pots are all just outside so you don’t have to go very far out to see them. But I think that’s fantasy.\\nAW: Are there repeat guests who keep coming back? Can you give examples of people you’ve gotten to know over the years?\\nGC: Oh, yeah. Well, there’s a family—the young woman, her name is Jade Pinz, and her husband Michael, and I think it’s her parents and the kids—they’ve been coming since the first sales we’ve had here. They’re really representative, I think, because they’ve become sort of expected; if they didn’t come, I’d be worried that something happened. But yeah, there’s always A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n34\\na lot of repeat people that come, and it’s really nice. Of course, it’s also really nice when people come that are new. When we did our fall sale last year with this ArtReach promotion, we got a bunch of people that I could see that they’d never been to a pottery sale before, and they didn't really know what it was about, and they saw that there was some food there, but they didn’t know, Who did they have to pay? It was really nice to have all of these new people come and have the experience. One of the really greatest things about the Tour is having these conversations with people that you don’t get to see very often. They’re people that are busy or they have a different life, and so you know them from somewhere—I met Steven Rosenstone, who’s the chancellor of MNSCU—he’s whatever the director of MNSCU is—and his wife is from Spain, so we have that, Spanish, in common. I met them through Warren, and I think she’s made pots, so there’s that interest. We were talking about the fact that we’re asking people to use the pots, and he had this incredible insight that studies have been done and theories have been proposed, and I guess what people believe now is that there are two ways to try to change people’s behavior: you can list all the reasons why their lives will be better if they do something differently, or you can just give them the experience and they will see the change, they will experience the change, and that will have a much, much greater effect than just saying, “You know, if you quit smoking, you’re gonna feel better; you know, if you quit smoking, you’re gonna be able to walk up and down the stairs and you won’t get tired and your breath won’t smell bad and, you know, people will like you better”—whatever it is that you want to convince people about. So I was thinking that this idea of giving people the food in pots instead of giving them the food in disposable paper stuff, it just fits perfectly: you’re giving people the experience; this is what it’s like. Then people come up to me and they say—I actually had people come up and say, “I went to the Brookside”—that restaurant where my son works (they use our pots there to serve their food)—and she said, “You know, why don’t I have something nice to eat on at my house? Why do I have to eat on these”—whatever it is that she had. Yeah, that whole idea of giving people the experience is just one of the really nice moments. You were talking about favorite moments, or one of the questions was about favorite moments—that is one of my favorite moments. And like that, there have been many when there’s just this communication with somebody and just this real nice insight into something.\\n02:24:10\\nAW: Are there other favorite moments or memories that come up for you?\\nGC: Well, there’s so many. Walter and Joan Mondale came out, you know? (Laughing) I wish my dad would have been around. Yes, then he might have accepted things a little better.\\nAW: Did you have siblings; do you have siblings?\\nGC: I had two siblings that were much later than I. My mom wasn’t able to conceive easily, and once I was born she was not able to conceive any more, so they were both adopted. It took her a long time to make that decision. By the time they came around, I was almost out on my way, gone to school in the States and stuff. My brother is a composer, and he lives in New York City. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n35\\nAnd my sister lives in Venezuela. She’s married, and she hasn’t found a way to be able to make a life outside or to leave, so she’s still living there.\\nAW: So your brother also went into, well, music?\\nGC: Well, yeah, it was like—\\nAW: —So you paved the way, perhaps.\\nGC: Yeah, but I think even more than I, he was into music from the time he was a little kid. That was going to be his thing; it was kind of obvious. And I don’t know, maybe my parents also felt music was a little more respectable than playing with mud. (Laughs)\\nAW: Has your mom come up here during the Tour?\\nGC: She hasn’t been during the Tour, but she used to be a big help in Venezuela when we did our sales there—everybody got drafted to help preparing food and stuff—but she’s been here to visit. But she’s 92 now; she’s going to be 92 in June—this month, the twenty-fifth. So it’s a little harder for her to travel now, but she is talking about coming up again this year.\\nAW: Okay. Now, can I ask, when you went to college, did you come on a student visa? How has that worked getting across the border? As an immigration historian, I’m very interested in how policies affect people’s lives. What has that been like for you?\\nGC: Yeah, there is an interesting little twist in that story, and that is that I was here on a student visa, and I can’t remember what that’s called anymore—\\nAW: —Ah, actually first in high school?\\nGC: Yep. Even in high school, student visa, yep. All the way through college, but my last year in college, I got that government scholarship for a year. So I got something called an exchange visitor status: a J-1 was that status at the time. I don’t know if it exists anymore because things have evolved. I mean, I had such a sweet treatment at the embassy; they were really, really very kind and nice and everything. When Laurie and I went back to Venezuela, as I said, we went back on vacation and we stayed for thirty years. We went back on vacation, and then after awhile I thought, You know, we’d better get back on track and get doing something because otherwise we’re going to just not have a scenario, a future, something—this is before I got my job with the World Wildlife Fund. I decided I would try to go back to school in the United States and get a master’s in something to do with environment. I thought environmental geology or something might be something that I could do since I had my geology major. I couldn't get any money, so I would have to come to the U.S. and do some sort of work and figure it out. So in order to do that, I applied for residency, and that involved a number of steps, which you probably know: I had to get a letter from every police department from every town that I had lived in in the United States for more than six months saying that I didn’t have any record, and I had to get all of these papers A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n36\\ntogether, and we submitted the papers. Then, the day that they were going to give me the visa, the consul called me in, and she was on the verge of tears. She said, “You know, we didn’t realize that you’d had a J-1 visa your last year, and you can’t get a residency until you’ve lived in your home country for two years for every year that you’ve had this exchange visitor visa. So I wasn’t able to get the [residency]—you know, we’d been six months kind of dawdling, having a wonderful time but not really doing much and getting all these papers together, and then suddenly we weren’t going; we weren’t coming back; we weren’t going to go back to school. That’s one reason that I stayed in Venezuela. But then, when I applied after we’d been married for thirty years, by then it was pretty obvious that I wasn’t trying to get into the U.S. by marrying a U.S. citizen. So that worked out pretty quickly: green card, and then I actually got my citizenship maybe three or four years ago now.\\n02:30:48\\nAW: Oh, okay, so when did you arrive to permanently stay here?\\nGC: The transition began mid 2005. We’ve had so many kind of circumstantial things that happened that you wonder, What is it that makes those things happen? We got a letter from Laurie’s friend from New Mexico, and she said, “You know, I hear all of this stuff, and things that are going on in Venezuela. Why don’t you come and visit? We think New Mexico would be a great place for you guys. And by the way, we have a car we haven’t been able to sell, and it’s sitting here, and if you need a car, you can have it.” You know, it was just kind of mind-boggling.\\nAW: You said she was good friends with Laurie?\\nGC: Yeah, very. Yeah, and we did go, and we did get the car. It was the best car I’ve ever had; it was a Ford Explorer—it was a wonderful car. But the other one was we got a letter from a friend of ours who had lived in Venezuela for a long time and then had married a university professor from Minnesota and was living in South Minneapolis, and he was going to go teach in China. So they were going to go to China for a year, and she said, “You know, with all the stuff that’s going on and we’re going to teach in China, and there’s a house, it’s here, and if you need a place and you want to stay” and everything, so, just when we were thinking about, How do we get there?, Where do we go?, we got a house in a beautiful, beautiful place near Lake Harriett, I guess, near the Minnehaha Parkway. For us, coming from an urban situation in Caracas, which is kind of grim in many ways, and the Minnehaha Parkway? The kids would be inner tubing down this creek down the middle of the city, with their dogs and—it was a heaven: go out for a run, go run around the lake, it was unbelievable. If I had to move back into a city, I’m definitely moving into the Twin Cities. I’m not going anywhere else. Great place to live.\\nSo we were there until the end of 2005. We bought this and moved in over Christmas/New Years, 2005-2006. And we spent over a year doing all of this—we built an addition—the showroom and the kiln room down here are all stuff that we put on there. Then, I had my first firing here in 2007. I worked at Warren’s for awhile, commuting back and forth and making pots A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n37\\nthere and having firings with him for the first year. And then built a kiln, had a firing, and it came out just in time to go to Linda’s for the Tour in 2007.\\nAW: Wow, you moved quickly when you got here. Why did you want to live here in the St. Croix area? When you were looking at where you were going to live in Minnesota, why the St. Croix area?\\nGC: Well, where we lived in Venezuela was just a little too far away from the city, so people would come out for the events because it was a big party and there was a huge number of pots and food and people and stuff going on, but they wouldn’t come out consistently, you know, every weekend, buy a few pots, and so there wasn’t like a steady income. We had to always be looking for other ways to make ends meet. When I moved here, I was in my mid fifties, and I was thinking, I don’t have the luxury right now of doing the New Mexico thing. I loved New Mexico: the food is awesome, the weather is great; Laurie was worried there’s not enough water, and she’s probably right. Water’s really going to be an issue in New Mexico. But I was worried that there wasn’t going to be a real audience there for my kind of pots. It’s the Southwest, you know—if people go there, they’re looking for Maria Martinez or Native American stuff, not Asian-influenced, traditional stoneware pots. And I thought that I wanted to maybe play it safe in terms of finding a place where I could be close enough to an urban area. I would normally have preferred to be in a more remote place, and I would have preferred not to make an investment in such an expensive place—because the mortgage is going to go on until I’m in my mid eighties or so. (Laughs) I thought it would have been much nicer to be in a small place, out of the way, more remote, but I needed to get some place where people would come and buy pots. So that’s one reason that this area appealed, and this particular house and this particular spot was really good.\\nYeah, the first time when we moved out to the place where we lived [in Venezuela], it was just the kind of thing you could do when you had a huge amount of energy. ’Cause everything was uphill; there wasn’t a flat spot on our property; everything was uphill or downhill, so every sack of cement, every sack of clay, every pot, every board—everything had to be carried up and, most of the time, carried up a trail; there was no way to drive to there, my studio was maybe a hundred yards from where the car could get to. I didn't want to repeat those things; I wanted to make it so that it was possible.\\n02:37:44\\nAW: I was just thinking of that photo you showed us of the view out your bedroom window—how you had to have felt to have had that view.\\nGC: It was glorious; it was wonderful. But we did have bats flying around, and it was living out in the tropical forest, where, one morning, the floor was covered with army ants. And they were just moving through, they didn’t hurt anybody and they weren’t looking for anybody to sting or anything, but they were always moving, and they happened to move through the house, and a couple hours later, there was not an ant to be found. But, you know, you get up, you’re gonna have coffee, and the floor is moving. (Laughs) A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n38\\nAW: Oh my God.\\nGC: It was wonderful. It really was a beautiful, beautiful place. We grew coffee, so we used to roast coffee before our tour sales, and then we’d sell coffee.\\nWe even had a label. It was a sloth sitting in the tree branch with a cup of coffee, so it was Sloth Brand Coffee—Café la pereza. That was fun.\\nAW: So coffee that could even wake up a sloth. (Laughs)\\nGC: (Laughs)\\nAW: I don’t know if you could grow coffee out here, but there certainly seem to be more vineyards around here, so maybe there’s a possible connection to be made between the wine cups and the vineyards here. I just noticed as we were driving around that it seems that’s also really blossoming.\\nGC: Yeah. Absolutely. That and beer.\\nAW: Definitely the beer, too. So we’ve gone through a lot of questions—let me just take a look here—\\nGC: —It’s been more stream of consciousness than—\\nAW: —You know, that’s how it goes sometimes. I think that’s great; you’ve covered a lot even in your initial descriptions. Do you have any follow-up questions at the moment, Tierney?\\nTM: No. Hearing about the immigration stuff is interesting because my aunt is from the Philippines, and she married my uncle and had to go through that process. It’s interesting to hear what people go through to get a green card to stay here.\\n02:40:23\\nGC: Yeah, I have to say my experience with going from the green card to the citizenship was really sweet. I imagine that not everybody’s had that kind of experience, but I went down to—I don’t even remember, I think it’s Bloomington—where the immigration services is—\\nTM: Yeah. I know where that is—\\nGC: —And then the ceremony was really sweet. That judge was this fourth-generation Norwegian. (Laughs) But he was so kind and talked about how his family also had come in from another country. The place was full of people—there were Somalis, there was a Peruvian woman. There was a Peruvian woman there who had worked as an assistant to my cousin, or my A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n39\\ncousin’s husband, who was the mayor of a section, a department of the municipality of Lima—Lima, Peru—and she had worked for him, and they were good friends, and we happened to coincide to the same day to our citizenship ceremonies. Anyway, I didn’t expect to be moved by that sort of thing because, you know, you think it’s just kind of a bureaucracy thing—it’s not going to change how you feel about anything—and it’s not true. It was really a neat experience. And some of Laurie’s family was there, too, so that was nice. Linda Christiansen was there, too.\\nAW: What did you find moving about it?\\nGC: Well, it really does give you a sense of being part of something, being accepted into a society. At this point, it’s hard to—I’d have to think about it a little bit more. I know I talked about it before.\\nAW: Did you have to give up your Venezuelan citizenship?\\nGC: It isn’t a requirement. I think it used to be; you have to swear you’re not going to have any loyalty to any other monarchs or governments or—(chuckles) that’s all to be expected and all. I guess being in a room with a bunch of people, and all of these people were moved—I mean, all of these people were just so happy—and I’m pretty clear-eyed about problems in the U.S. and problems with inequality of resources and problems of inequality of people’s education whether they’re from different economic or racial or cultural classes, but my sense about everybody in that room was that they felt they had achieved a standing in a land where there was opportunity—that they were actually going to be able to make a life, and, you know, it’s certainly been the case for me. I realize I’m privileged because I have all kinds of friends and networks and connections, and I speak the language, and some of these people, they’re coming without any of that, and still, you know, they were there. You could just get that sense of how they were looking to a better future.\\n02:45:12\\nAW: When you first came over, when you guys moved back from Venezuela and moved to Minnesota, did you have a sense of identity as an immigrant, or not at all?\\nGC: I think I did. Yeah.\\nAW: You had traveled back and forth so much—kind of on a regular basis almost—coming up for the summers.\\nGC: Yeah, but I was going back. And always kind of attaching myself to a different reality. But my parents were immigrants in Venezuela, too. My dad always felt a little bit like he wasn’t really accepted because he was Colombian—always neighboring countries have this thing going on. So I think they never felt real accepted in Venezuela. Well, my dad definitely was a social animal, so he knew everybody and everybody knew him and a lot of people respected him. My A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n40\\nmom wasn’t really able to—she was always thinking she was going to move back to Peru. I guess that affected me in the sense that I felt like I wasn’t really, totally Venezuelan either.\\nAW: What did you kind of consider yourself when growing up there?\\nGC: There were so many foreigners in Venezuela—we all grew up speaking Spanglish. Those people have gone on to live all over the world, and I don’t know how they feel. Some of them say it was too bad not to have that sense of having a real place, you know? Laurie grew up in Mason City, and there’s no doubt, to her, that’s [home] ground.\\nAW: That’s home, home town?\\nGC: Yeah.\\nAW: And you were saying you didn’t really have that sense of fitting—\\nGC: —Not really.\\nAW: Well, you left pretty young; you were in high school.\\nGC: I left pretty young, yeah. Fifteen.\\nAW: What was your first impression of the U.S.?\\nGC: Well, it was all pretty weird. I went to a school in Wisconsin for two years. They came to recruit to Venezuela, and they went to this international school that I went to, and they made some sort of deal. And at the time Venezuela was riding high, and the Venezuelan bolívar was pegged to the dollar at a very favorable rate, so it was affordable for my parents to send me to this school. And I got all kinds of help from the school. But I think what they were looking for is I think they were looking to try to diversify a little, to desegregate. Racism was pretty rampant. It was pretty amazing. I mean, I didn’t bear any brunt of much of anything because I don’t look so different, and I could speak English. But I saw things you wouldn’t, you know—like with black musicians that would be invited to come—Muddy Waters. I mean, it was a good school—Kohlers, Mayers (Oscar Mayer, the wieners)—that was the kind of people that went to school there. So it was very weird.\\nAW: So was this close in Wisconsin?\\nGC: I don’t know: Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. I have no idea where it is; I’d have to look it up on the map. But I used to go from Chicago on the train. That was cool, that was really neat. There were really a lot of very sweet, very nice people, but that was really kind of an experience, not having a clue, you know, how to— (Laughs)\\n02:50:02 A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n41\\nAW: (Laughs)\\nGC: Yeah, we don’t want to get started with the stories.\\nAW: Well, just some context: where you were growing up and going to school in Venezuela, was there a real mix of people from all over the world?\\nGC: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.\\nAW: Was there racism there, too?\\nGC: Yeah.\\nAW: How did that operate similarly or differently from racism in the U.S.?\\nGC: I can remember some cases of it as being even uglier. There were kids that were Black American kids going to school there—not many, one or two—and the people that were in Venezuela weren’t necessarily highly educated or sophisticated; they were people that were maybe highly qualified to work in the oil industry or support industries that are around the oil industry. But they were not necessarily your enlightened, liberal, whatever, kind of people—there was all kinds of people. Some really wonderful—you know, it was the real world; there was everything.\\nBut, yeah, that first experience was kind of interesting. And from there, my parents thought I was having too good a time there because that was a co-ed school, so then I went to Massachusetts and I went for two years to a school that was all boys, which is now co-ed. Williston Academy. That was in Easthampton, Massachusetts, but it was even much more sort of wild and radical than this co-ed school had been. But it was good.\\nAW: Yeah, you had mentioned that a little bit earlier; I was hoping to hear just a little bit more what you meant. When you said you got involved in some of the issues of the time—this was the mid to late ’60s—what did that mean for you? What kinds of things were you passionate about then?\\nGC: Well, I wasn’t finding anyone in the school who was turning me on to any learning, but there was a social environment there that was kind of interesting politically. Then, of course, I was seventeen or eighteen, and no girls at the school—there was Northampton School for Girls, there was Smith College—and you’re trying to figure out how to connect with the opposite sex at some point somehow, so that was kind of basically the first thing in your list of priorities of what to do, but the day of the moratorium, all of the students decided that they were going to march from Easthampton/Northampton down the middle of the road, which is about a seven mile walk, and have the whole student body do that. Then, the headmaster of the school decided that he was going to lead the march. It was like, “Wow, that was pretty wild.” And there were all kinds of A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n42\\nthings going on; it was the times. There was the University of Massachusetts, James Taylor giving a concert and people jumping on stage and putting a joint to his mouth so that he could have a hit while he was playing. So drugs were a part of the scene. And I was pretty much ready to go somewhere and find something. It wasn’t the best time in my life. So going to Iowa really actually turned out to be really nice.\\nAW: Was it a big transition from the social environment you were experiencing in Massachusetts to go to Cornell in Iowa? Or did you find similar—\\nGC: —There were some similarities. It was still the same time, so there was a lot of the same stuff going on.\\n02:55:20\\nAW: Did you see a difference between the East Coast and Midwest approach to those issues going on at the time?\\nGC: Yeah, it’s interesting. Yeah, I think so. I remember hitchhiking a lot when I was in Massachusetts, and I got a ride with this sweet little old lady, and when she started talking about Nixon, it was almost scary, you know? She was really mad and hateful; I didn’t ever see that sort of thing in Iowa. People might have been objecting just as much to the war, but it wasn’t quite as radical, I think, as Massachusetts was.\\nTM: Massachusetts is hardly known for their subtlety.\\nGC: (Laughs) Yeah. Yeah.\\nAW: Did you get involved in political activism when you were at Cornell?\\nGC: Not so much. There was a dorm where there were some fraternities—they were called “social groups” because fraternities weren’t allowed, but they were fraternities—and then there was what they called the G-D-Is—the GodDamned Independents—and I was one of those. We lived in one dorm, and we were all the weirdos. I just kind of gravitated towards that and doing things—mostly, I was so much into pots. And then when I was gone for two years and came back, I lived off campus. When I lived off campus, I shared an apartment with friends. So it was all about learning to live on your own and cooking and, you know, we didn’t do a lot of camping, but nature was still big, whole wheat, soybeans, learning to cook vegetarian, brown rice—all of that sort of thing. And the relationship between that and the pots and all, I think that was really what was central.\\nAW: I had a follow-up question and then we’ll get to some reflective questions; I realize we’ve taken up a lot of your time—\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n43\\nGC: Well, I’m happy, but I hope that some of this is useful. But does it get edited? Because nobody’s going to sit and listen to this! (Laughs)\\nAW: They might, they might.\\nTM: You’d be surprised.\\nAW: I mean, historians of art, historians of ceramics, historians of Minnesota—this could speak to a number of people who are interested.\\nAW: We’ve talked about moving in and out of all these cultures and places, so a follow up question on when you were working with Indians and setting up those guiding tours: how did you decide which connections with them [to make]? How did you negotiate these trips? What was that like, moving into those other areas of Venezuela?\\nGC: Well, the Indians had had contact with people for a long time. The mountain that we used to climb up was called Roraima—it’s on the intersection of Venezuela, Guyana, and Brazil—and it was called the Crystal Mountain by Sir Walter Raleigh, who walked through there, and then Conan Doyle based the book Journey to the Lost World on that mountain. He’d been by there, too. So we weren’t anything like the first people to go there. But when we first went, with Laurie and another two friends of ours, the Indians didn’t want to deal with us. We actually went and climbed up the mountain on our own, and didn't do very much on top because it’s pretty easy to get lost; it’s all full of cracked rocks and stuff like that. But then, a few years later, friends of ours had been there and had contact with one particular Indian, and they’d kind of made friends with him, and these guys are always desperate for help for something or other, so there had been a couple of projects like taking PVC—rolls of pipe—to get water down from this little spring up here and bring it into the village so that they wouldn’t have to go from the village out to other places to get water. That relationship began, and then when we started bringing people, they realized that they were making a lot of money by doing this. And, of course, that generated a certain amount of issues within the community. They are very much a community, and so they made a sort of cooperative arrangement where there’s a number of guys that work, so everybody gets a turn: the next group that comes in, you get those guys. We had a really good working relationship and I would even say a friendship with one guy, two guys—first one, then another: Carmelo was real smart—very little man, very smart, very concerned with making things work and work well. They have evolved now; they really run the show now. Now if you want to go there, you have to go there and you have to set up the trip with them. You can only be on the top for one day because there’re more groups coming, there’s very few places to camp, they limit the places that people camp, they make sure that people don’t leave garbage, you know. They’re taking care of their mountain, which is great. It used to be that we used to pay them for every bag of garbage that they brought out because I’d catch them stuffing garbage under a rock—because, I mean, you have to carry the stuff, and it’s heavy, and you’ve gotta walk for two days with this garbage, and then what are you gonna do? You’re gonna throw it behind your house anyway. So yeah, it was an evolving relationship. I hope they’re doing well now; I don’t know, I haven’t been there for years. A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n44\\n03:02:36\\nAW: Thank you – I was just noticing this pattern of you going in and working with communities from such diverse places, and it seems like you’re able to strike up friendships and connections and make things work with people. You’ve traveled all around, and you’ve been part of all these different places. I thought that was just interesting to see. And same thing happened when you moved here: you’ve established friendships here, too, in Minnesota, and connections.\\nGC: Yeah. I’ve been lucky—Yeah. Yeah. I guess so.\\nAW: You mentioned, when you were first starting the Tour, some kind of subtle cultural expectations that maybe you weren’t aware of; do you have just a couple of examples of what those little things were that you were noticing?\\nGC: I was afraid you might ask. (Laughs)\\nAW: You don’t have to share them if you don't want to. I think it just helps to know, what are some of those?\\nGC: I’m trying to think of something that’s clear and that makes the point. It’s just hard to—this is really dumb, but this is one: for example, in Venezuela, if you’re driving behind somebody and they’re driving slower than you want to go, you tailgate in order to indicate to them that you’re going to pass. So you’re really riding this guy, and they notice, and then eventually—you know, nobody’s being very helpful here, you know—but eventually if they get bored with having you riding on their tail, they may give you the opportunity to pass. Well you wouldn’t want to do that here. It’s that kind of thing. That’s a very kind blatant [one], you know—I know that. That isn’t the kind of subtleties I’m thinking of. But there are situations where there are some expectations: people send cards a lot here, you know? Like a thank you card for doing anything. I get thank you cards for stuff. I get thank you cards from the group of students that came and I showed them around during the Tour. You know, that’s very sweet. In Venezuela, the mail doesn’t work. We never sent invitations to our Encuentro by mail. We would divide a phone list—we had telephone numbers of all of our people, and we would divide those phone numbers among the ten of us, and then every person would have fifty phone calls to make. And we never hit on the idea of the phone tree. (Laughs) This year, I sent cards to the people who worked here as volunteers, and it was for the first time. It was kind of like, “Oh! I know: we gotta send cards. That’s what you do, isn’t it?” People here, at least in many cases around here, they don’t interrupt much. In Latin America, you can’t get a whole sentence out without somebody coming in and picking up. It’s not rude; it’s just that they’re either agreeing or disagreeing, or adding information, or excited about because it’s something. Here I have to hold myself back when we have our potters’ meeting and I want to tell everybody about the Tour and somebody starts talking, and you have to sit and wait until they’re done making their point. And they do have a point, and they get to it, eventually. That’s a small, but real—you don’t want to offend people, and that’s not the intention, but sometimes— A Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nG. Cuellar\\n06/02/14\\n45\\n03:07:08\\nAW: Well, and sometimes those small things make a difference, you know: gestures, or how people talk, how they converse, things like that. So thank you for telling us about those. I think those are important; that’s all part of negotiating a place for oneself, or making a place a home, I think, is figuring those things out. I bet all those people in the room with you during that citizenship ceremony would probably have a whole list of moments just like that. (Chuckles)\\nGC: (Laughing) “You know what happened to me?!”\\nAW: Yeah, getting to know Minnesota culture. Even though it is made up of people from all over the world, it really is a changing, dynamic thing, still. Newcomers to Minnesota all observe these kinds of things.\\nTM: My hand still hurts from filling out thank you cards from my graduation party. I wrote out like two hundred of those. (Sighing) Oh!\\nGC: (Laughs)\\nAW: It’s true.\\nTM: My mom was just sitting right there making sure I filled out every single one a different way.\\nGC: You know, it’s just so different. For example, where we used to live in Turgua, there was no landline; there was no phone. Literally, for the first part of the time that we lived there, there was no telephone at all. One time, Laurie never got home, and I had to get in the car and drive in, and as I was halfway in my brother was halfway out to meet me to tell me that she’d had an accident—that everything was fine—but there was no way to get that information to me because there was no telephone. And then suddenly, there were cell phones. So we went from no phones to, if I walked to the top of the mountain, I could use my cell phone and get a phone call and actually communicate. And I always had these conversations with Warren. Warren—well, he always laughed at people that had cell phones.

I’m just a commentator on this. I don’t want to talk about myself.\\nAW: Can you tell us where you are from?\\nJK: Well I have a very smart aleck answer to where I grew up – I grew up in New York in 1993\\nwhen I got divorced. Haha! I shouldn’t have recorded that, should I?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n2\\nAnyway, the significant things are that I married a guy who was from Minnesota. We lived\\nelsewhere, but we came back to Minnesota because he wanted to be here with his family so I\\nended up graduating from the University of Minnesota with a degree in journalism. My first job\\nafter journalism school was working for the Minnesota Crafts Council as the editor of their\\nquarterly publication, which was called Craft Connection. When I was still at the University I\\ntook part in a special class that you were selected to be in and we produced a one-shot magazine.\\nIt happened to be 1976, the bi-centennial year, and so we chose as our topic the crafts revival.\\nWe produced a little black and white magazine called Crafts in Minnesota. I had nothing to do\\nwith that choice; I was not in the arts at that time. It was completely random. But the professor\\nwho was running the class invited Warren MacKenzie to visit the class and give us some leads\\non people to start to talk to and work it out from there to decide what would be in the magazine.\\nThat was my first exposure to Warren, which turned out to be a kind of pivotal encounter.\\nSubsequent to that magazine class, I applied to the Minnesota Daily, the college newspaper, to be\\na theater critic, because I was a double major in journalism and theater. They did not need a\\ntheater critic; they needed somebody to write about art. And I could not believe it because there\\nwas studio art and art history there. Why didn’t they have a qualified person to do the reporting\\non this? They looked at my resume, such as it was, and were like “oh, you did this magazine\\nabout crafts. You can write for us about art!” And I thought, no, no I can’t! I don’t know\\nanything about art! But I did end up doing little journalistic reports on things that were\\nhappening. And little by little ever since then I’ve been an art writer or reviewer or critic\\ndepending upon what you want to call it. But the first person I published an interview with in the\\nDaily was Warren. I had already met him and I just thought that would be an interesting place to\\nstart. So again, this stuff keeps coming back to me.\\nThe other people in the pottery tour--I did know Jeff Oestreich back in those days and I knew\\nConnee Mayeron. Guillermo [Cuellar] wasn’t here yet, and I don’t think Bob [Briscoe] was\\neither. I knew Linda [Christianson] by name and Janel [Jacobson] and Will [Swanson] by name\\nbut not in person. So that is the deep history of my knowledge of ceramics in Minnesota.\\nAW: When did you move to Minnesota, the first time?\\nJK: Let’s see, I think 1972 [actually 1969].\\nAW: And you had been in New York before that? Or other parts of the U.S.?\\nJK: Yes. I was born in California and my father was career army and so we lived all over the\\nplace. Alaska, Oregon, Washington. I graduated from high school in Seattle. Met the Minnesota\\nguy in Indiana. So just all over the place.\\nAW: Can you tell us some of your first impressions when you moved here in 1972? What was\\nthe scene like and what did you think?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n3\\n00:05:00\\nJK: It was all so new to me then so I didn’t know what to think [Narrator’s note: I was not\\ninvolved in the arts. This answer relates to the time of journalism school, and thereafter, 1976\\nand on]. I took everything at face value. I had no basis for comparing to anything else or\\nknowing what made Minnesota different from any other place. It was just, that was what was\\nhere. So I did begin to expand out from that point, I would hear about people and places through\\nediting the publication. It increased my knowledge.\\nAW: Did you live in Minneapolis at that time?\\nJK: In Minneapolis at that time and then Golden Valley, on the south side of Minneapolis. I’m\\njust trying to think if there is anything I can say about what I thought at that time.\\nAW: Can I ask what neighborhood you were in?\\nJK: We were near Lake Harriet, Garfield Avenue and then Queen.\\nI was just trying to see if I can make some sort of analysis about what the craft field was like at\\nthat time. There were certainly a lot of things going on. There were far more galleries here at that\\ntime than there are now, both art galleries and specifically craft galleries. There was a place\\ncalled Sontag Gallery in St. Paul that was on Grand Avenue in a house and it was run by a\\nwoman named Fran Sontag and she was, well, I don’t know what happened to her, we haven’t\\nstayed in touch, but she was sort of a mentor. She would tell me about things and explain the\\ncontext of what I was seeing there [in the Sontag Gallery]. It was quite nice as I was new to all\\nthese things. I just listened to what everybody told me.\\nI don’t know if this is really relevant, but there was also a woman named Shirley Johnson and\\nshe was a potter who was Warren’s friend, or domestic partner or studio mate, I’m not sure.\\nSomehow or another she and Warren were involved. I met her through Warren. And she had\\nbeen a college English professor who became a full time potter. She used to teach at Northern\\nClay [Center] once it came into existence. But she was also a mentor, both in writing and in\\nknowing about what was going on in the field. I remember specifically one time I needed to\\nwrite about a show at the Rochester Arts Center, and I simply walked in and looked at the stuff\\nand thought, I don’t know what to say. And Shirley said very calmly, “Well, what do you see?”\\nso I said, “Well there are these things on the wall” and I started to describe what I saw. Since\\nthen I’ve told other people who are getting into writing this. It’s wonderful advice. “What do you\\nsee?” Just the basic thing of what’s there. So all the years I subsequently lived other places –\\nIllinois, Atlanta, Tokyo for four years, and then in the New York City area for twenty some\\nyears. I’ve always had this warm spot in my heart for Minnesota because this is where it all\\nbegan, and people were good to me. My ex-husband always had family here, so we came back\\noccasionally and then I could renew my acquaintance with people from that time.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n4\\nAW: And, what was it about writing about craft and art that interested you? Because you said it\\nwasn’t something that you set out to do but kind of fell into your lap. What kept you going that\\nyou were interested in?\\n00:09:30\\nJK: I should say first that my wanting to be a theater critic was an unrealistic expectation because\\nI have a hereditary hearing loss. It runs in my family. Two of my three siblings have it as well.\\nSo I could not have gone on in that. I would not have been able to pursue that professionally. I\\ndidn’t realize that at the time. When I started writing about art I was just learning about editing\\nas a field. I also had another editing job at the time editing the program magazine at Orchestra\\nHall. And I knew nothing about music either. So these were just two new subject matters and I\\njust had to worry about the language and the production of the magazine, the journalistic\\nfunctions in both cases, but I did learn vastly more about the subjects. I think art spoke to me in\\npart because it was a visual language. I think because my hearing is not good I look for visual\\nclues. So I’m looking at art in the same way I’m trying to see visually if I don’t quite hear\\nsomething. It’s a parallel kind of activity. So what interests me most is not doing the scholarly\\nthing and writing the definitive paper on a major figure in the field or some sort of deep history.\\nFor a long, long time I did not call myself an art historian. Even now it’s a little dicey. Where\\nwas I going there?\\nMy favorite thing to do is to just encounter a work and to figure out what it says to me visually.\\nThat made crafts interesting to me, because they were underrepresented, underwritten about.\\nThere was this constant complaint that we need a language of criticism for crafts, which I’ve\\nnever really felt was true. I think our ordinary, everyday language just needs to be applied to this\\nmaterial. So I’m interested in the underdog. And it was an underdog field. So that’s what I was\\ngetting at. I didn’t want to write the definite piece. I liked discovering something, and this was an\\nopportunity for discovery. Just lately, the last two years or so, there has been a huge interest in\\nclay in the art field. All sorts of artists are not doing finely crafted work because they don’t have\\nthe skill, but just liking the material and what they can do with direct hands on work to that. I’ve\\nthought maybe I’m going to get to the point where I will back off clay because other people will\\nbe writing their essays or dissertations on that and I’d find some other underdog field to write\\nabout at that time.\\nIt’s been very satisfying, and also my introduction on this personal basis – small scale, local –\\nthis place, what’s happening here, good people with kind of noble aspirations and good hearts. In\\nthe craft field you did not meet people who were going into it for fame and fortune. It’s just not\\ngoing to happen. So they were all motivated by something, the physical process, the feel of the\\nmaterial, touch comes up a lot, particularly in ceramics but also in the other craft mediums. So it\\nwas just rewarding and satisfying as I went along.\\nA kind of oddity of my background is that I ended up living in Japan for four years. Of course I\\nknew about Japan because of MacKenzie’s connection to Bernard Leach and traveling to Japan\\nand all that. It just so happened that the house we leased in Tokyo was just a quarter of a mile\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n5\\nfrom the Nihon Mingeikan, the actual heart of the Mingei Movement in Japan. So I went down\\nthere to try to be a volunteer when I was brand new in Japan, thinking I could be a docent or\\nsomething. Give tours to the foreign visitors. Well what I found out was that they had no idea\\nwhat a docent was. They had no concept of that in Japan. So I go walking in there and try to ask\\na woman at the desk if I can volunteer, and she looks at me, deer in the headlights kind of look\\nthat said, “what is this foreigner talking about?” But actually there was somebody on staff who\\nhad lived in the U.S. and knew what I was talking about, so she decided that it was best not to\\nhave me give tours, but she would walk me around with the curators who mostly did not speak\\nEnglish and they would talk about the works in an exhibition and she would casually translate\\neveryday conversations. And I would take notes and write up a little text that would appear in\\neach room in English for the tourists.\\nSo I got this intimate acquaintance with Mingei, not as a practitioner, like Randy Johnston or\\nsomeone going there to do an apprenticeship, but a wonderful, meaningful exposure. And I\\nthought that would make me less interested in American crafts. I don’t mind getting this down on\\nthe record. When I came back I was writing about art there and I started writing for some\\ninternational art publications about Japanese art, so when I came back to the States I was not\\ngoing to renew my acquaintance with craft, because I was thinking about Japanese art in which\\nthere is, well, this kind of spiritual quality. In Shinto, the indigenous religion in Japan, they\\nbelieve that the gods, the Kami, can reside in any kind of wonderful natural object. It could be\\nthis fantastic tree, or a rock or the wind – you know kamikaze is this divine wind with the gods\\nin it. Of course, when that was used in wartime context it was not nice. Anyways, I thought,\\nwow, they have this spiritual quality, numinous quality, in the works themselves through their\\nreligion. That’s the real thing! People in the States are just kind of diddling around or pretending.\\nBut when I came back, I actually changed my mind about that and decided that the Japanese\\nculture provided that to every artist who was working there. They could exploit it or not. In the\\nStates when someone is attached or devoted to a single material, they are essentially creating that\\nkind of a cultural, or religious if you want to call it that, rationale for the meaning that they put\\ninto that work. So they are inventing something that is just handed to the Japanese. So then I\\nthought, well you know maybe this is cooler. This is pretty admirable that everybody works at\\nthat, even if they don’t think in those terms.\\nAnyway, there had been a couple of American potters I met in Japan and so when I came back\\nconnections reasserted themselves and I began to follow the fields again. The dialog about the\\ndifference between art and craft had not changed one iota in the time I was gone. It probably\\nnever will. Don’t worry about it. The discussion is interesting, but we don’t need to come to a\\nconclusion. It’s okay with me. Okay, enough about that.\\n00:18:40\\nAW: Well, I have a couple of follow up questions. On that last note, what was the dialogue\\nabout art and craft in the nineteen seventies? Locally, nationally, whatever you’d like to talk\\nabout.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n6\\nJK: I don’t think it was as much of an issue here. For instance, when I wrote for the Daily, and\\nsubsequently for the Star, which was the afternoon paper, not yet folded into the morning paper\\nat that time, anyway, I could write about anything. I didn’t have to just write about painting and\\nsculpture. It was just all considered the visual arts here. In a larger sense, and probably\\nparticularly in New York – I think New York has been provincial actually, isn’t that funny –\\nabout this idea. At the time I visited New York and went to this gallery that showed a lot of\\ncrafts and the owner said, “Don’t use that word here. If somebody uses that word we can only get\\ninto the “Home” section of the New York Times, not the “Arts” section.” So there was this sharp\\nline drawn and people liked to make the argument that because the work was functional it was\\nlesser than the pure artistic expression, which I don’t buy at all. Architecture isn’t discounted\\nbecause it is functional.\\nSo this line that was at this time fairly sharply drawn in New York because the city was so\\ninfluential and all the magazines were based there, that polluted the rest of the country with that\\nidea. And it still does come up. You’ll hear a snotty dismissive remark about something “just”\\nbeing craft. But based on my own now thirty some years of writing in this field, I would say\\nevery person I’ve ever heard making that dismissive comment is not a particularly great critic.\\nThey are people who are looking to increase their own stature through diminishing something\\nelse. And the really good critics, people like Roberta Smith at the New York Times and Peter\\nSchjeldahl and a number of others I could mention are interested in the visual and will respond to\\nit on their own terms. I think it is still an issue in academia because of academic striving and\\npeople fighting against each other to enhance their own positions. So craft can still be a field that\\nis put down but I think at the highest levels of art criticism, it is not excluded anymore and that\\nline is not drawn. And the interest in alternative forms of visual expression, painting is not, well,\\nNew York is still a painting town, but it’s just not as dominant as it used to be because nowadays\\nartists work in many mediums so they just use whatever material suits their particular purpose at\\nthat time. So it’s kind of dissolved as an issue.\\nAW: Why in the 1970s and 1980s was it not a big issue here? Why was there not the line drawn\\nas distinctive in art and craft [in Minnesota]?\\nJK: Again, I’m not sure I was sophisticated enough when I was here to make that kind of an\\nanalysis of what went on, but maybe there are some sort of cultural explanations. Like maybe the\\nScandinavian populations were familiar enough with ceramics from that background or maybe\\nthe Midwest is just more egalitarian in the practical sense of making useful things. Or the\\nextension from everyday hobby crafts into a more skilled kind of work, you know, maybe people\\ncould make that jump.\\nI would also give at least one small nod here to Warren MacKenzie, again, and his first wife,\\nAlix because, at least the accounts I’ve read of that time when he was first here at the end of the\\n1940s, they did everything they could to promote the idea of pottery. He gave talks for women’s\\ngroups, libraries or, you know, anybody who would listen to him talk about ceramics. He also\\ndid things like, at that time, he had his little sales area in his studio so people could see how he\\nworked, see how things were made at the same time they were buying a piece. So that kind of\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n7\\njust dogged promotion and the fact that he did teach for many years and generated these multiple\\ngenerations, lineages, of students. Certainly this had to do something. I’ve never asked him if he\\nencountered certain prejudices when he was first trying to set up. By the time I was here in the\\nseventies he was, maybe, the art department chair at that time? I don’t remember the exact dates.\\nAnyways, he was for a time the department chair so he was a respected, tenured professor. There\\nused to be a glass program here [at the University of Minnesota] and at one time there was\\ntextiles, but I think those were thrown out. But then Minnesota does have the Textile Center\\nnow, in which a lot of sort of hobby type groups have gotten together to present themselves more\\nseriously with a gallery and everything. So I don’t know the exact explanation, but at least those\\nthings might have figured into why it happened here.\\nIt’s also hard maybe to compare it to other places, thinking of ceramics in particular, California\\nhad a really strong ceramics community, and around the war time and immediately after the war\\nthere were a lot of small ceramics industries, studios that emphasized production, you know, that\\nscope of work. Then when Peter Voulkos showed up in California in the mid-1950s and very\\nrapidly turned to doing sculpture rather than the functional things he had done before that, you\\nknow, that gave another dimension to ceramics in California at that time. ArtForum magazine\\nwas started in the Bay area and moved to Los Angeles between, maybe sixty-four and sixty-seven,\\nsomething like that. ArtForum was quite supportive of ceramic activities even though it\\nwas an art magazine striving for national and international recognition. It still accepted ceramics\\nin that context. So, Minnesota may not be unique in its support, but I think it has its own specific\\nstory and differs from the kind of work that was done in California. If there had been an actual\\nregional art magazine based here, it probably would have changed the nature of the work that\\nwas done here.\\n00:27:30\\nAW: On that note, you brought up some of the other crafts that were also important such as\\ntextiles and glass. Can you say a little more about those? When you went to write about various\\nexhibitions and artists, who were you meeting and what kind of craft were they producing in the\\nTwin Cities?\\nAW: Oh, and did you actually travel through Minnesota and write about stuff, or mainly in the\\nTwin Cities.\\nJK: Pretty much the Twin Cities. The Minnesota Crafts Council sponsored an exhibition each\\nyear that was, at that time, on the grounds of what was called the College of St. Catherine and\\nthat would be all mediums and it would be reported on in the Craft Connection magazine that I\\nwas editing. What I wrote about for the Daily and subsequently the Star was entirely dependent\\non what was in the galleries.\\nWhat I can say about glass, I’ve never followed glass quite as closely but there was a guy that\\nwas teaching it at the U [University of Minnesota]. I think he was in sculpture but he was using\\nsome glass at that time. If I’m remembering right, his name was Wayne Potratz. P-O-T-R-A-T-Z\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n8\\nor something like that, whom I’ve never met. There was also a guy that I do remember writing\\nabout who was doing cutting-edge, not just beautiful objects, in glass and his name was Fred\\nTschida. T-S-C-H-I-D-A, I think. Then there were other people like Dick Huss, who I think is\\nstill around, but who I didn’t know personally, but I remember his name from those days in\\nglass. In textiles, I don’t know if I can come up with names so much. I was probably closer to\\nceramics in those days, or maybe it was just shown more.\\n00:30:08\\nAW: Do you remember or can you reflect on the communities in each, the glass community,\\ntextile community, ceramics community, and the audiences? Was it the same audiences for all of\\nthose crafts? Were the communities interacting at all? Can you tell us a little bit more?\\nJK: Well, as far as I know, the Minnesota Crafts Council was attempting to bring all those things\\ntogether. This is more speculation than certainty, but I would speculate that there were different\\naudiences but that galleries would not tend to specialize in just one thing. I think Sontag Gallery\\nwas pretty much, well everything that I remember from there anyway, was ceramics. Maybe she\\nshowed something else. So that’s why I think there probably were different audiences. Anyway,\\nthe Crafts Council that I was involved with was trying to pull everybody together so that the craft\\nfairs, like Uptown which still exists, were all mediums, not just one.\\nAW: So when did the [Minnesota] Crafts Council start? And can you tell us a little bit about that\\nhistory?\\nJK: Before I was here, it seems to me that it was towards the end of the sixties that it was\\norganized. In 2009 I briefly served as guest editor of American Craft magazine. It was still\\nlocated in New York at that time. It was before they moved here and they just needed somebody\\nto fill in as editor. And I remember that there was a report on the Twin Cities craft scene\\npublished at that time. This resulted in a bunch of letters disputing tiny details of the history that\\nthe artists had written in there and I thought, Wow, I didn’t think that would be a controversial\\nthing! It was just nice that Minnesota was represented in a national magazine. Why would people\\nsay “No, it wasn’t in 1968 it was 1965!” or whatever. So, I’m not sure I know the exact story of\\nthe [Minnesota] Crafts Council, or for that matter, the beginning of Northern Clay, which has\\ncertainly been an important institution here. At any rate, at the time I started working with the\\nMinnesota Crafts Council they had only been doing the publication, well, maybe it was its first\\nyear? I was still a journalism student at the U [University of Minnesota] so I was just kind of an\\nintern or apprentice to the person who was their first editor. Then I applied for the job\\nsubsequently. That was mid-seventies so it was all sort of formative still at that time.\\nAW: When you started at the U [University of Minnesota] did you know you wanted to be a\\njournalism student from the very beginning, or journalism major? Or did you explore other\\noptions? Was journalism a passion of yours?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n9\\nJK: I think when I started college my first major was sociology. I didn’t think I wanted to be a\\nsocial worker and what else do you do with that. So then again, these totally random personal\\nthings that happen to you that lead on. Since I was finally going back to finish my education, I\\nwas already married and my husband worked for IBM, it used to be the joke about IBM that it\\nstood for “I’ve been moved” because they would transfer all their employees. So we knew that\\nthat was in our future, that we were going to live in different places. I was always interested in\\nwriting and as a kid had thought I was going to be a poet, but that never went anywhere, but I\\nthought journalism would be a portable profession, something I could do no matter where my\\nhusband’s work took us, which indeed it was. I mean, right now it’s a terrible profession to go\\ninto, with newspapers and magazines drying up and blowing away. You can write all you want\\nonline but you don’t get paid for it. I don’t know why anyone would want to go into journalism\\nright now, but at that time, it was an interesting thing to do. As it happened in my life, as we\\nmoved, journalistic writing also offered me the chance to engage with each new location and to\\nmeet people. You know if you’re going to interview somebody that starts your connections. So it\\nwas a great thing to do, it worked out very well for me. But I didn’t know it was going to be art\\njournalism when I was just starting. That was a surprise. An accident.\\n00:35:28\\nAW: A happy accident; a great accident.\\nJK: Yeah. Turned out that way.\\nAW: Yes, because you’ve provided so many great works on craft. We’ll get into this hopefully a\\nlittle bit more later. So when you are at the U [University of Minnesota] in the early seventies\\nand you said you got to know Jeff [Oestreich] and Connee [Mayeron] and some others, can you\\nsay anything about getting to know other students at the U? Art, craft students or ceramic\\nstudents? Did you get to know students or faculty in the ceramics program at the U while you\\nwere at the U or was that after?\\nJK: No, I don’t think I did really. I mean I was meeting people through the Minnesota Crafts\\nCouncil, but I wasn’t at the point in my writing that I would do studio visits. That is always a\\nnice way to meet people. I just didn’t know enough to even engage in that type of activity. I was\\nworking with galleries so I wasn’t necessarily meeting individuals.\\nAW: That is interesting because you have the perspective then from the galleries. Some of the\\npotters we have interviewed have talked about the galleries and the Tour and being able to show\\nwork on their own terms as being important. Can you talk about the role of galleries in\\nsupporting craft artists during that time in the seventies and how that has changed?\\nJK: I’m probably speaking in a larger sense, more than just Minnesota, but it seems to me that\\nthe way the craft field went is that there were shops, and then there were galleries that gave more\\nspace, more isolation, treated things better and were very important for a big chunk of time both\\nin raising the prices of work, which was better for the makers, and in exposing it and taking it\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n10\\nseriously in a public way. In the last decade maybe, the galleries are disappearing. Specialty\\ngalleries have disappeared because there is no longer that distinction, that wall that I was talking\\nabout. So if I go to New York this year and just walk around to the galleries, I’m going to see\\nceramics. There are definitely artists who are working in textile mediums as well [who are in\\nNew York galleries]. Jewelry, no, it doesn’t make that jump for the most part. We now have\\ndesign galleries that include art wear, that could be clothing or jewelry or things like that.\\nThe galleries, or craft media that were accepted into the art galleries, no longer needed to be\\nthese specialty spaces devoted to a single medium, so those have really disappeared. I’m trying\\nto think of who is left. Garth Clark had a ceramic gallery in New York but closed that. He said it\\nwas the end of crafts but it was really just the end of his gallery that’s all. (laughs) So what’s\\nhappening now and it does play into the [St. Croix Pottery] Tour, one is looking at the situation\\nnow and how do you market this work. Particularly functional work, which has a little bit harder\\ntime finding its way into the art galleries mostly because it is sold for a more modest price and\\ntherefore doesn’t suit the price structure of art galleries. And if it does get raised to that price\\nlevel, people aren’t going to use it anymore because then it is too precious to risk damaging it.\\nThe option that the Tour seems to provide nowadays is direct sales out of studios so they [artists]\\ndon’t have to be paying a middleman anymore. So they get a hundred percent of the profits. Of\\ncourse, this also means that they have to do things galleries did for them like PR and maintaining\\nimages, dealing with the public and certain kinds of record keeping, that plenty of people don’t\\nwant to do. If you sell out of your studio you have to do all those things. You have to be the\\nbusiness office, the shipping department, everything that’s needed for that activity. So it’s maybe\\nnot heaven, unless you have a partner who does the more business oriented side – if you’re lucky\\nin that way- but it does seem to be working as an option today for somebody to actually make a\\nliving that way.\\nWithin the crafts field itself, or maybe I’m just speaking about ceramics here, I think the field at\\nlarge has been dismissive of functional work. There are people, and Garth Clark has done this as\\na matter of fact, who say, “Oh you can’t make a living at functional pottery.” Well, you can too!\\nAnd now that he [Clark] has gotten out of New York, I don’t know how much time he has spent\\nin Minnesota, but he made a tour of North Carolina last year, apparently his first time there.\\nWhich I thought, Oh for pete’s sake, because that’s another big center for ceramic activity. Again\\nan example of New York provincialism, of thinking that something in New York is the only\\nanswer to every question. So he gets there and he meets plenty of potters who are making a\\nliving in North Carolina and if he spent any time here he would discover the same thing. You\\nknow, maybe you don’t make a ton of money, but then hey, there are plenty of painters and\\nsculptors and every type of artist who don’t make a ton of money either. Functional crafts,\\nactually, because they are utilitarian and modestly priced, do have an option for a bigger market\\nthan art at large, so ceramic sculptors should not be dismissing function. It is another vital and\\nviable option. So let’s see, does that answer the question about the position of galleries?\\nI still think, if it could be worked out financially, for me as a critic and person who goes to\\ngalleries that I do appreciate seeing things in galleries. Even the most purely functional objects,\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n11\\nbecause I think they can be responded to as visual creations. If you pay a lot of attention to a\\nceramic surface it’s as beautiful as an abstract painting. It has texture, color, movement, and\\nbesides that it has touch, you can pick it up. So I think to see it isolated on a pedestal or table or\\nmounted on a wall in a gallery gives you the option to focus on those visual qualities. I think it’s\\nstill really nice to be able to see work in that way, whether it’s in a purely commercial gallery or\\nin a museum that presents work. If you walk into a shop you are going to see a lot more stuff all\\ncrowded together, and you can still make the effort to focus, but the piece is not going to be lit as\\nwell. It’s not going to be isolated from its surroundings to be appreciated in that singular way.\\nAnd maybe because we don’t have the Japanese tea ceremony, which was a way of examining\\nthe object in very intense focus, a gallery would kind of substitute for that tea ceremony\\nconcentration here. Although, you know there is a guy in North Carolina who is talking about the\\nice tea ceremony, Southern hospitality and using ceramics for that. I think that’s cute. (laughs)\\n00:44:45\\nAW: Can you talk a little bit more about the tea ceremony? Is that something that you observed\\nor learned about while you were in Japan?\\nJK: Oh, I knew a little bit about it before, and it’s certainly something that people talk about in\\nJapan. Or rather, in ceramics in the U.S. They do talk about it in Japan as well. In Japan today a\\nlot of the tea ceremony is just a social grace that nice young women are taught to do. Wear your\\nkimono, sit on your feet, and offer a serving of tea. I once talked to an English museum person\\nwho was visiting Japan who said at its best museum work was like the tea ceremony, in that the\\ncurators would be talking about an object and examining it in that same sort of intense\\ndirectness. I thought that was a really nice idea as well. I think what I knew about it in relation to\\nBuddhism in its old history in Japan the tea ceremony was – the tea house was – an egalitarian\\nplace in which even the shoguns who wanted to come in for the tea ceremony had to take off\\ntheir swords and the weapons were left outside and everyone sat on the same level right together.\\nSo it had this notion of sharing. But mostly it was this distilled aesthetic experience. You were in\\nthis little room with maybe one window with a carefully controlled view so no distractions. Your\\nhost would prepare the tea for you and you would examine the bowl before you drank from it\\nand talk about those kind of aesthetic experiences. When I went to Japan there were a couple of\\ntimes that, like once, touring a temple we took part in a tea ceremony with a small number of\\npeople. That was when I discovered the kind of tea they use. It’s a powered tea that they mix and\\nit’s terribly bitter so they also give you a little sweet. The thing to do, as I found out, is you hold\\nthe sweet in your mouth while you drink the tea so you can tolerate it. At least, that is what\\nforeigners do, I don’t know if the Japanese do that.\\nAnother time I was visiting an art gallery in the Ginza, a part of Tokyo, that showed all kinds of\\ncontemporary art. The owner of it, an older businessman, took down a box that was on a higher\\nshelf in the office and opened up the little layers and took out this tea bowl and had tea prepared\\nfor, I don’t know, maybe there were two or three of us sitting there. That was probably some\\nvery valuable object. I didn’t know enough about things to know exactly what it was. So, it was\\njust sort of a magnification of the experience of use. Something that, in a way, we can do.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n12\\nIn the galleries in Japan the practice there was if you come into a gallery just to look around you\\nwere going to be served tea. Just everyday sort of tea, but it will be brought to you on a little\\nwooden plate with a bowl on it, not a handled cup, but a Japanese kind of tea bowl that you drink\\nout of. In the summertime you’d be furnished with a barley tea that’s not sweet, it’s called\\nmugicha. Which I came to love, it’s very refreshing. That was just the ordinary experience of\\nwalking around to the gallery, being served tea. So, you had a ceramic object there. You know,\\nfood in Japan too, well I don’t know how much this relates, but when you eat in Japan you have\\nlots of little dishes. They are not all ceramic – they might be lacquer or sometimes tempura\\nwould be served in a little basket, so you know different kinds of materials – but you handle\\nalmost all of them. You pick up a rice bowl, so your hands are touching all these different\\nmaterials. I was thinking that it does apply here because, for instance, when I had lunch and did\\nan interview with Randy and Jan Johnston [potters], they had their own dishes but lots of little\\nthings on the table. I don’t even remember what was in all the small dishes, but wonderful things\\nto look at. Maybe that’s a little of an adaptation of everyday in Japan. I think that’s why people\\nin Japan tend to be sensitive to materials and a potter in Japan can feel assured that if he makes\\nsome kind of subtle change in his work, that he will have an audience that will recognize and\\nappreciate that difference. Whereas here we tend to expect more of a grand gesture or difference\\nin form or a completely new glaze or something like that that is very obvious change. We don’t\\nhave the same ability to recognize subtlety just because we’re not constantly exposed to it.\\n00:50:25\\nAW: I think you bring up a really interesting point about the connection of food and pottery.\\nSeveral of the potters have talked about how they have had or have a passion for cooking and\\nwhy they were attracted to functional pottery was combining those interests in a way. Finding the\\nbest plate to showcase a cheesecake, actually, is what Connee [Mayeron] talked about. One of\\nher early desires was just finding something that would just really show off the food. Can you\\nsay a little bit more about that connection here in America? Between food and pottery,\\nspecifically functional pottery, how that might have played a role?\\nJK: You know, historically, the association, like European porcelain, was a status object on\\nlavish display on tables by the kings or, you know, whoever the people were that were collecting.\\nSome of those guys had collections that were thousands of objects and could serve a hundred and\\ntwenty people at once. You would have centerpieces and you would have candelabras and all\\nkinds of display objects, but they also had a function. The function was larger than just putting\\nfood in a dish in front of you. Certainly in our culture, that’s a social ritual that is very important\\nto us. Dining and to share an object. If you go to a potter’s house you’re never going to be given\\na set of identical things. Everybody’s not going to have the same dishes all the way around the\\ntable and that’s a little bit of a hard jump for the average public person that is used to buying a\\nten-piece table setting or when you get married you get these sets of identical pieces and you just\\ntake one off the shelf and you don’t think about it. You know what you’re getting and it’s all\\nvery uniform. The experience of using functional pottery is that each piece, even if they are a set,\\nthey’re not going to be exactly identical. You don’t want them to be. Why would you want them\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n13\\nto be!? You know when you begin to think about this you look back at our ceramic industry and\\nthe production of dinnerware and you think, how boring. But you have to get to that point, and\\nyou have to be willing to invest more money in an individual object.\\nI’ll tell you another personal story. My children grew up with pottery around, we even had a\\ndinnerware set that we had Jeff Oestreich make for us, it was a set, but it was hand decorated and\\nso it was not identical. So my kids grew up with that, but have not traditionally been buyers or\\nconsumers of pottery themselves. Sometimes I would make my visits here coincide with the\\npottery tour, so I could do that. So, I took my older daughter with me and she enjoyed it. She\\nliked looking and it was nice that we could spend time together. Once we were at Bob’s\\n[Briscoe] and he shows a young person who was an apprentice to him named Jason Trebs, who is\\nfrom St. Paul, and my daughter and I both really liked Jason’s bowls. But she [daughter] said,\\n“Thirty dollars for a bowl?!” You know, you can get a bowl, a plastic bowl, for what, a dollar\\nninety-nine? And I said, “Well look, this guy went to college or to art school or something and\\nhe had to set up a studio and buy his equipment and he’s having to pay taxes and do all this\\nbusiness. He’s not a peasant in China who makes pennies a day.” You know? So there are all\\nthese reasons that justify the cost. Of course, being a sucker, I bought the bowl for her and one\\nfor me. Then when I would come back to visit her, she had the bowl out all the time. She had\\nfruit in it usually. And she said, “You know, I just love that bowl!” So, the next time we went on\\nthe pottery tour together, she bought a piece or two of Jason’s and maybe something else. Now,\\nI’m not a big collector, I’ve been collecting for a long time so I just have a lot of small things.\\nBut I would say, she’s now committed to buying individual things. She’s looking for plates and\\nshe wants to get rid of her old set of Pottery Barn or whatever it is and have all these individual\\nplates. So yay! Also, her husband is quite a good cook and so it’s been interesting for them. He’s\\nmade some things that look really good on some of those dishes. They are all so individual. It\\njust gives you scope for a social experience and a visual experience, a kind of creative exchange\\nor engagement with an object. It works for you and you do something for it.\\n00:55:54\\nJK: The relation of food and pottery? Let’s see. I’m sure there is much more that can be said\\nabout it then that. One of the things that is of interest to me, not specifically in Minnesota but in\\nfunctional pottery right now, there is an interest in trying to find new forms in pottery. So not just\\nbowls and plates and mugs. So there are people who are making unusual shaped plates and also\\nthings like a juicer, there’s no reason that can’t be in ceramics. There are people who are doing\\nthat. There’s a young woman here in St. Paul who has made a specialty of making spoons and\\nspreaders. Now, you wouldn’t give those to a small child, but rather you’d use them in certain\\ncontrolled situations to avoid the risk of breakage. That’s something that has not traditionally\\nbeen made in ceramics and is a new option. It’s nice to me that that kind of invention is going on.\\nAW: You had talked about Warren MacKenzie when he came to give a talk. Can you say a little\\nbit more about when you met Warren what was it like and what was he talking about and how\\ndid that speak to you? And if you can say a little bit more about functional pottery in Minnesota.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n14\\nJK: When he talked to that class that I was in, the very first time I ever met him or saw him, he\\nwas not only talking about ceramics but he was telling us about other forms of work. That was a\\nlong time ago and I can’t remember specifically who he mentioned or who he lead us to, but I’m\\npretty sure that one of the people he recommended was Walter Nottingham, who taught textiles\\nat River Falls [University of Wisconsin] at that time. When I interviewed him [Nottingham] he\\ntalked about--he didn’t make functional objects--but making the unseen seen through his work. It\\nwas kind of mystical, you might say a little hocus pocus, but I thought it was good work. We also\\nfound a guy doing copper-smithing and a Greek immigrant who was carving wood panels. We\\nalso included someone who made refrigerator magnets, which I’m sure horrified some of the\\nmore serious artists included in that magazine.\\nI’m pretty sure at that first meeting he [Warren] told us about Japan and about Mingei and\\nBernard Leach and his experience of going there. I think I remember from that very first\\nencounter of him telling this story of when Hamada and Yanagi, the founder of Mingei, and\\nLeach made a tour of the United States in 1952 and came here [to Minnesota] and there was a\\nsale of Hamada’s work. You had to draw a number to get in and choose an object and Warren’s\\nnumber was way back. And almost everything was sold at that time but he chose a piece and\\nYanagi told him he had chosen the best piece in the show. So at that time I was not writing about\\nart yet, it was all a new language to me. It was just striking to think that you couldn’t make an\\nimmediate judgment. You had to think about things and you had to look closely because you\\nmight not recognize the virtues of an object at first glance.\\nI think Warren was just doing his promotional thing that he had been doing for years. He was\\ntalking to a bunch of journalism students who knew nothing about his field and he was just\\ntrying to make us see what was interesting about it and what some of the options were. When I\\nactually did interview him for the magazine he was expanding on those experiences and talking\\nmore specifically about his creative expression through pottery.\\n01:00:52\\nAW: So when you were talking with him or when he was presenting to the class, do you\\nremember what he said about why he found success in Minnesota with functional pottery? Was\\nthere a receptive audience?\\nJK: I don’t think there was a receptive audience. I think he made it. He has said later, at least I\\nthink he has said it and others have commented too, the nature of the subtlety of the kind of\\npottery he does – and most of the people on the Tour do too – relates to the Minnesota landscape.\\nYou would be unlikely to make such subtle work if you lived in New York City, for instance. If\\nyou were in a harried kind of urban, vertical, hard surface it would vary from here where you\\nhave the lines of the landscape. Somebody in Georgia, an old time potter there, once talked about\\nhow at one time pottery was made to attract tourists, so it was brightly colored. And then that\\nkind of fell out of fashion and then they went back to browns. I remember this guy saying he’d\\nnever met a potter who doesn’t like earth colors. I think that is the case here too. I mean\\nobviously there is porcelain in pure white and there is wonderful color that can be brought into\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n15\\nclay. There’s nothing wrong with that at all, but it does seem very harmonious to have these\\nearth colored things that are made here.\\nAW: It’s interesting you say that because when we were talking with Guillermo, he said when he\\nwas looking to move to the US permanently [from Venezuela], he had friends in the Southwest\\nhe was looking to stay with and friends in Minnesota, and he was concerned that the pottery he\\nmade might not speak to the audience or the design styles you find in the Southwest pottery\\nworld. Do you have any comments about that? Does pottery have a regional audience or\\nregional connection that is hard to translate to other areas? How does the Minnesota functional\\npottery compare to other regions?\\nJK: Well, there are exceptions here. There are people who do highly colorful works here. Or like\\nMaren Kloppmann, who makes very geometric pieces. There used to be a woman who lived\\nhere, I don’t know if she still does, named Amy Sabrina, who did pictorial, decorative work.\\nThere are several other people who are doing low fired highly colored decorative work that looks\\nlike Italian pottery or something like that. So there are exceptions. It’s not to say everybody here\\nmakes the same thing by any means. If you go to Connee Mayeron’s site you will see the people\\nshe invites and even her own work is not the earth kinds of tones.\\nI would say California has had more design-oriented pottery. California doesn’t have a real\\nstrong functional tradition going on today. It’s got more sculptural work today. The Southeast is\\nprobably the most similar to Minnesota just because they never completely lost their folk pottery\\nthere. We did here. There were still folk potteries around when functional pottery became an\\ninterest during the post-war baby boom of the 1960s. There were still operative people in the\\nSoutheast making gallon jugs and all that stuff. That was all efficient and functional, using local\\nclay and glazes. So there are sections of the country that have a regional character, but I would\\nsay at the same time there are so many ceramic residency programs now. Maybe you might work\\nin some kind of an apprentice situation after you got out of undergraduate school, but even after\\ngraduate school it can be hard to set up a studio on your own. So there are these places like the\\nArchie Bray Foundation and Penland, and Watershed, places you can go and live. So it’s gotten\\nto the point that it’s not unusual to find somebody who spends ten years going around to those\\nresidency programs and then finally is ready to set up on their own. I think that has kind of\\nstirred the pot so it minimizes the regional character because people are moving so much and\\nworking with people from other regions and sharing information and ideas. I don’t think it is\\nunreasonable for Guillermo to say that if he was committed to a certain look that he would find a\\nmore receptive audience in one place rather than another. That’s still true, but less tightly\\nregional today then it used to be.\\n01:07:05\\nAW: One last note about ceramics on the national landscape. You mentioned earlier about\\npotters being able to make it [functional pottery] a career. Can you tell us how career\\nopportunities for potters have changed over time? Bob [Briscoe] had mentioned in his interview\\nthat in the fifties and sixties most potters were teachers as kind of a main part of their income and\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n16\\nmaybe later they retired to focus on pottery. Maybe today this might not be true so much\\nanymore. Maybe your entire income can be made by the pottery you are producing?\\nJK: I’m not so sure that the pattern is exactly like that or maybe that is not exactly the reason\\nbecause throughout the twentieth century there have been potters and there have been functional\\npotters. There have been small-scale industry or more artistic kind of studios. When I worked on\\nthe book Makers: A History of American Studio Craft we could go back and document in every\\ndecade people who were working primarily as potters. There were art colonies back in those days\\nwhere maybe it wasn’t a residency program but it amounted to the same thing; a sympathetic\\nenvironment where people would be working in multiple mediums and developing an audience.\\nSomeone might come for the textiles but see the ceramics. There was that kind of way to build\\nan audience. There were also places in the early post-war period. There was Gump’s in San\\nFrancisco that was kind of a high-end department store but they did market handmade objects.\\nThey were a good market for crafts in those days.\\nIn New York City there was the American Craft Council, which in the 1940s opened a place\\ncalled America House that sold fine, handmade crafts. The idea was to enable people to make a\\nliving and have a market. I think teaching became an option so much just because of the post-\\nWar baby boom going to college. It started after the war with everybody going to college on the\\nG. I. Bill. The college population expanded so there was more need for teachers. There were\\npeople teaching things who hardly knew their subject! Everybody was desperate to learn\\ntechnical things and trying to keep up on the field, to keep up with what their students were\\ndoing. So with the baby boom and the expansion of colleges and art programs it seemed for a\\ntime that anybody who graduated from a program could find a teaching job. That’s just not true\\nanymore. I think it started falling off toward the end of the 1980s. It’s been gradually going on\\nfor a while. It’s easier to talk about these things if we simplify, but as you would know, history is\\nnever that simple. That’s all I have to say about that maybe.\\n01:11:00\\nAW: Why do you think it is that people can now have their main job now be a potter?\\nJK: Well, the ability to promote things nowadays through the Internet and mailing lists for\\ninstance. I hope somebody has mentioned this to you in one of your conversations, but I think the\\ngreat advantages the [St. Croix] Pottery Tour has is the specific geography here. That only one\\nhour out of a major metropolitan area it’s cheap enough that these people could afford to buy\\nland and set up a studio. No matter how primitive their beginnings were, they could do that.\\nWhereas in Chicago you have a huge potential audience there but two hours out you’re still in\\nthe suburbs, so you really have to go a long way. Then the question becomes, how far out will\\npeople go for a pottery tour? Can you get that far out of town and have this sort of thing. But\\nhere it is an easy day trip. You could do all seven of them [the pottery stops] and still get it done\\nin a day if you didn’t know everybody and weren’t stopping to talk all the time. So there is that\\nspecific advantage that made it easier to live as a potter and to market here. It’s probably a little\\nharder for people who have chosen to live in the city, although the Twin Cities are still very\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n17\\naffordable compared to other cities. I’ve heard statistically that it is about thirty percent cheaper\\nto live here than in New York for instance. How could you be a functional potter and live in New\\nYork? Pretty impossible idea.\\nOne other thing, I do know specifically about the pottery tour that was held in Austin, Texas that\\nwas specifically modeled on this pottery tour and the success of this one. They even have it on\\nMother’s Day weekend as well, and they also have invited artists from other locations. I’m sure\\nthere have been shared studio sales and the idea of the pottery tour just as a notion probably is\\nnot unique, but the way they developed it – and I’ll be interested to hear what you learn about\\nhow it developed over time and the number of participants – they’ve set up a model for taking\\nthis seriously. They are also setting up a model at this moment as to how this is going to be\\nhanded over to the next generation. That’s a big question because everybody who is on the Tour\\nnow is sufficiently mature, and were mature twenty some years ago when it started, which means\\nthey are pretty close to senior now.\\nAW: That is definitely a concern on a lot of people’s minds as to how to transition it.\\n1:14:30 – [END OF FIRST INTERVIEW]\\nAW: We’re resuming the interview with Janet Koplos. This is Andy Wilhide. It is August 26th,\\n2014, and we are here at her home in St. Paul, Minnesota, resuming our interview for “A\\nMeasure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley.” Thank you\\nJanet.\\nWe were just chatting about the last interview and you had concluded that portion by talking\\nabout how important location is in the success of some of these tours. The St. Croix Tour, but\\nalso some other tours and the advantage of the proximity of the St. Croix Valley to a major\\nmetropolitan area, but still far enough away that it is still affordable for the potters themselves. Is\\nthere anything else you want to say about the importance of location in the success of the Tour or\\nhow it compares to other tours?\\nJK: I was just trying to think if there is anything that distinguishes it in the sense of, well,\\neconomics for instance or the sociology of the region or something like that. I mean you can’t\\nreally do this sort of thing in a place like New York because it is not an affordable place to live\\nand you have to be so far out for it to be affordable. I mean there are organizations and groups of\\npotters that find other ways to cope with that but it means the pottery in those places tends to be\\nmuch more expensive, so then that limits the market in a way as well. What generalization can I\\nmake? There are places like Austin and also Seattle, which doesn’t have a strong functional\\npottery orientation, but there certainly are people there who are doing well and maybe there is\\nsome energy building in those places. They also are like the Twin Cities, just good middle class\\nkinds of urban areas. So the ones with the most, well I don’t know if I could sustain that without\\nfurther research and comparison, but that would be my perception. That’s as far as I want to go\\non it, I’m not going to claim that’s true.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n18\\nAW: You were just talking about Chicago and having heard from some potters that it is hard to\\nsell functional pottery there. Can you tell us a little bit more for the national context on the\\nreception of functional pottery. Where are the places where it is not really well received?\\nJK: Oddly enough, Los Angeles does not have much of a functional marketplace. You would\\nthink it would because there is definitely a design orientation there that is quite prominent and it\\nalso has an important history in twentieth century ceramic sculpture. Clay itself is significant or\\naccepted in L. A., but somehow or another it just hasn’t developed a climate of encouraging or\\ndeveloping a market for functional pottery. We could probably say something the same about\\nChicago. It does have a couple of ceramic institutions. I mean, Hull House, a settlement house,\\nback in the early twentieth century had a ceramic program that was very successful for quite a\\nwhile. Now there are a couple of buildings that function as artist centers that have a lot of\\nceramics in them, but not so much the individual studio potter. They all tend to be out\\nsomewhere else.\\nOther places, it seems that almost every community that I ever hear about has some local potters\\nliving there, some people who produce some things. That seems to be not uncommon across the\\nU. S. I would think a distinction that could be made in praise of this area is that it’s not kitschy\\nstuff. It’s not just highly decorated very obviously appealing following a kind of formula, and I\\nthink that might be a consequence of the fact that, as I said before, this just kind of bloomed out\\nof Warren MacKenzie’s teaching and there was a philosophical background to his work in clay,\\nwhich you wouldn’t normally expect to be the case anywhere. He had this international\\nknowledge and experience and so the people that he taught were exposed to that, and I think that\\nmakes it a different environment. So other places where there might just be a potter, or just\\nsomebody who likes to make things or likes the touch, they are not really thinking of it in terms\\nof the social and philosophical significance for our time. That is something important to do\\nnowadays. That would be something that distinguishes this area.\\nProbably the best comparison, there’s a bit of that same thoughtfulness, in the Southeast,\\nparticularly North Carolina. They had not lost the tradition of folk pottery. It continued up until\\nthe time of post World War II when studio pottery became more widespread. Also, strangely\\nenough there is a place in North Carolina called Jugtown Pottery that was formed by two\\nsophisticates from Raleigh who had lived in New York City and sold folk pottery in New York\\nCity, and then came back to North Carolina and established this pottery. They were designing\\nand conceptualizing the work but they weren’t actually the ones who were doing it. They were\\ndrawing on that folk pottery background. Anyway, this is a very long winded way to get to the\\npoint that this was in maybe the twenties, I can’t remember the exact date when Jugtown was\\nfounded, but the fellow of this couple knew about Chinese ceramics and so some of the shapes\\nthat he had folk potters make for Jugtown were Asian influenced shapes. So that’s a little bit\\nunusual, and we had a different instance of it here. I mention that example to say that influences\\ncan come in unexpected ways.\\n01:22:45\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n19\\nAW: You’ve talked about the significance of Warren and his networking and public speaking.\\nI’m interested in the various audiences. If Warren had landed somewhere else do you think\\nfunctional pottery would have developed as strongly in Minnesota? Do you think he would have\\nhad such a strong response to his work elsewhere? The major audience seems to be in the Twin\\nCities, the urban population. Not necessarily the people who were right in the St. Croix River\\nValley. Trying to trace the development of functional pottery in Minnesota, who were the first\\nsupporters of his work? How does that work in other parts of the country – is the local audience\\nthe main audience? We were talking about the approximation to the large metropolitan\\npopulation that would consume this pottery.\\nJK: I think that if these people were just trying to serve the local population in the St. Croix\\nValley they couldn’t make a living because there just aren’t enough people. There is not enough\\npopulation to be buying stuff there.\\nAW: I don’t know if this was always the case. A few people [potters] mentioned that local\\nrestaurants would ask them to make stuff for restaurants. So there was some local support early\\non?\\nJK: Well I can think of a potter out on the West Coast who lives out in the country who has\\ngotten restaurant commissions because he is not that far from the Bay area and so with the\\nsophisticated eating there he’s making a living in a rural area. But, again, he’s not necessarily\\nserving his rural population with this. So, maybe it is more of an urban phenomenon. As to\\nwhether Warren could have landed someplace else and done this same thing. I guess I would say\\nI suspect so. I don’t know if he could have done it in Chicago because of the geographic\\ndifficulty we already talked about there. Say he had been in St. Louis or some other place, I think\\nthere has to be a certain population. He needed that in order to generate this level of activity over\\ntime.\\nBacking up, I’m thinking of Clary Illian, who lives near Iowa City or something like that. She\\nalso had the experience of going to the Leach Pottery and she came back and she does, well I\\ndon’t know the exact geographic boundaries she draws from, but she does think of herself as\\nbeing a local potter, serving that distinctly regional population. Even if Des Moines, or Iowa City\\nwhich is far smaller, maybe they add up to enough to support a potter. Could she have a pottery\\ntour there? Is there that kind of activity? No, I don’t think so. You just have to have a bunch of\\npeople that are interested.\\nAs an aside, I just met a person here in the Twin Cities who as it turns out has been collecting\\npottery since he was in his twenties and he must be in his sixties now I suppose, but he did not\\nknow about Northern Clay Center. He’s not buying locally. He is a pottery consumer and he\\nwould buy when he traveled to Europe and to Asia. Isn’t that strange!? You’re right here in this\\nhotbed of ceramic activity and you did not know? So to reach everybody who would be a\\npotential consumer of this work is difficult, unpredictable, and random. How did this guy miss\\nall the information on what’s available?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n20\\nAW: Was there a kind of style he was collecting that was not really inline with the functional\\nstyle of pottery? Is that why he maybe didn’t pay attention to it here?\\nJK: Well actually I have seen his collection now because I was very curious about this and he\\ndoes have a few things that are consistent with this, but yes, your point might be well taken\\nbecause he tends to have more things in a style popular with the French and in Holland with a\\nblue glaze. It’s a little more finished, a little more perfect. It does not look like commercial\\npottery, but it doesn’t have that kind of earthy more rough-hewn wood fired aesthetic that is so\\npopular here. It might be that he saw one of those things and that was what he responded to and\\nnow he’s just ended up with a few things that represent something closer to the Minnesota range.\\nBut he doesn’t have anything from any of the people I’ve collected from around here. He has\\ngone to Northern Clay since I met him. So maybe he will become another portion of this market.\\nAW: Well that’s good that you helped him realize what is around here, in the great ceramics and\\nart community that is around here.\\n01:29:35\\nJK: There are other places that don’t depend specifically on one single city, and I’m thinking of\\nMaine, which also has a good deal of ceramic activity comparable to here. It has a ceramic\\nresidency program, Watershed [Center for the Ceramic Arts], that is located there and also the\\nHaystack School of Crafts, which has been around for sixty years or something now and so has\\ngenerated public awareness. I’m sure the people in Maine probably get some response from the\\nBoston metropolitan area, but they are a little distance and I don’t think Portland or the rest of\\nMaine is such a huge population in the terms of what I’m talking about that you need that city.\\nThey have to be drawing from somewhere else, either these other various shops and things where\\nyou can send your work to or Etsy. They might be marketing that way but not the kind of\\ngeographic cohesion that we have here.\\nAW: Geographic cohesion—as in everybody focused on the St. Croix River Valley? Because\\nwithin Minnesota there are definitely other areas in the pottery community.\\nJK: I just meant that if we surveyed those people on the pottery tour, I would guess that some\\nhuge percentage of their market is the Twin Cities. It is a major source for them. That’s not to\\nsay that they don’t have shows elsewhere and other means of selling.\\nAW: As you’ve been researching pottery in the U. S. and also in Minnesota, what role did Red\\nWing Pottery or places like that have in setting a tone or helping develop a certain taste for\\npottery and ceramics and useful pottery? Has that come up at all?\\nJK: My suspicion is that it doesn’t. I don’t hear people mention that in terms of sources for their\\nown work or interests or discovery of pottery. I don’t hear the makers say that. California is\\nanother place that had a local pottery industry that lasted for a long time. My suspicion also\\nwould be, and again I’m speculating based on partial knowledge so I don’t want to make big\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n21\\nclaims about this, but I wouldn’t be surprised that it isn’t a different audience, more of an\\naudience for Americana or for antiques or for that sort of thing. That they would go for Red\\nWing or another comparable place because of its association with history. People now,\\nsomebody who lives in the Twin Cities and decides that they are going to go on the pottery tour\\nand they buy something, they are buying outside of the history. They are just dealing with some\\nwork. Somebody really ought to analyze this. It’s an interesting question – what is it that attracts\\nsomebody to this today? I don’t think, including myself among this population, that we are the\\naudience for that. I wouldn’t think that we’re buying it out of some kind of nostalgia for an\\nearlier time. I don’t know how people discover this. I certainly couldn’t say my own experience\\nof stumbling into it is typical.\\n01:34:15\\nAW: Well, maybe that is a good opening. What was your first experience? What did you buy\\nand why did you buy?\\nJK: I had exposure to ceramics as a child but it was nothing that anybody would want to claim\\ntoday. My father was career army and most of the army posts we would live on there would be a\\ncraft shop, you know where you could go for hobby crafts. So you could pour slips into molds\\nand it was all awful, kitschy things. I think I’ve thrown away everything. My sisters and my\\nmother and I all did that kind of thing. We would paint whatever came out. So I knew that there\\nwas ceramics and that it was something somebody could do. As far as encountering this\\nparticular phenomenon in Minnesota and deciding it was something that I responded to and that I\\ndid want, it was Warren, again, talking to my special class at the U [University of Minnesota];\\nthe magazine class. I don’t think anybody in the pottery tour was in that magazine because it was\\nso long ago.\\nAnyway, exposure at that point and then a gallery I mentioned earlier, Sontag, on Grand Avenue\\nin Saint Paul was showing a lot of work and I did meet people who are still working through that.\\nI was not living here when the pottery tour started. I don’t remember which was the first one I\\nwent to, but it was a well-established phenomenon. I had the opportunity to be here at exactly\\nthat time of year to take part of it. And by then I was already a confirmed ceramophile, or\\nwhatever it is. For me it wasn’t an example of going on the pottery tour and having an epiphany\\nand saying, “Oh this wonderful stuff I’m going to collect it”. It wasn’t like that. It was little\\npieces here and there that prepared me for this opportunity. I always make the argument that one\\nof the wonderful things about functional pottery, in particular, is that it’s a place where you can\\nbuy an aesthetic object that is interesting to talk about in any kind of art terms, but it’s something\\nthat a person of modest means can afford.\\nThere used to be this big question about how you would write about a functional ceramic object.\\nThey said, “Well, it’s just a bowl. What can you say about that? It’s just a bowl.” But if you\\nreally look at things closely, if you look at a bowl really closely it has a landscape of texture. If\\nyou really attend to it, the variations in glaze surfaces are like paintings. I mean if you really\\nlook. It’s an object that moves through space so it is sculpture. It’s got everything that every\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n22\\nother kind of art has, but you can still get one for, you know, twenty-five dollars if you are lucky.\\nMaybe a little bit more than that. When you have that you can put it on your table and look at it\\nevery day or it can be the thing that you use for your breakfast cereal. I like using them too but\\nthere is a good thing about just setting it out there and looking at it. Treating it like it’s an art\\nobject. Then you begin to appreciate all the visual qualities and tactile qualities that it does have.\\nBut, again, it’s also just nice to use it.\\nAW: Are there a couple pieces that stick out or a piece in your mind that you bought at the\\nTour? Or acquired at the Tour?\\nJK: I’ve probably gone a half a dozen times, so there are quite a few times. You know the big\\ncompetition is Northern Clay [Center]. It’s hard to go in there and get through the sales gallery\\nwithout getting anything. I try not to look! I can’t buy something every time I go. So that\\ncompetes a lot. The times that I’ve gone on the Tour I started off small because at first when I\\nwas going I was not living here so anything I’d have to carry back to New York with me. So I\\nbought little things and not too many and then it grows in time. You become fond of certain\\npotters and you are interested in the changes they make so then you want to have a characteristic\\npiece and you want to have a new piece. It just goes on and on. It grows on you.\\nAW: Are there certain potters on the Tour that you really follow closely or that you’ve collected\\nsome of their materials?\\nJK: Well, Jeff Oestreich would be the classic example because I bought his work when I was\\nfirst being exposed to clay back in the seventies. As far as things that I’ve bought on the Tour,\\nit’s not just the seven local people. The fact that this has multiplied to such an extent so I’m\\ncertainly buying things from people from all over the country. I particularly, I guess it’s okay to\\nsay this, I mean I’m a critic and I’m supposed to have a degree of impartiality here but I was\\nonce on a panel at Northern Clay that was choosing, I think, the McKnight or one of the\\nfellowships they administer and Will Swanson happened to apply that year. I remember being\\nstruck by that because his is very modest, very un-showy, quiet pottery. Yet my sensation, which\\nI still remember, I think that was the first time I ever saw his work, I just felt like I was in good\\nhands. That this was someone who cared and who took care in a very kindly kind of serving way.\\nNot the kind of egotistical artist that we might have a stereotype of a certain kind of creator.\\nThat’s not to say that I always buy his work or only buy his work by any means, but I have a soft\\nspot in my heart because of that background.\\nAnd then Bob Briscoe’s work, just because it’s so generous, you know, he’s just a big hearty\\nperson and a giving person who has been helpful to many, many people. You see the scale of his\\nbowls, especially, big serving bowls, and it’s like an embrace. You can just see him holding one\\nof these giant bowls with food he’s going to share with everybody. There is a whole kind of\\nmystique associated with the size of those works. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to bring\\nmyself to buy one of those biggest ones because of the expense, so I have smaller examples of\\nhis work. Still, that’s where the heart is. Not to play favorites, though, because I like lots of\\nwork.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n23\\n01:42:25\\nAW: Would you mind sharing any comments or observations about the other potters’ work and\\nyour interaction with their work?\\nJK: As history sort of?\\nAW: Yeah.\\nJK: Well, Richard Vincent I don’t know at all. When I feel like I can’t get to all the locations his\\nis the one I always skip. I feel bad about it. I would rather go to every single one just to know\\nwhat’s there and what people are doing. So I’m definitely not as aware as to who he regularly\\nbrings with him as a guest. I don’t think I had met, well, Bob came here after I left Minnesota, so\\nI don’t think I met him until I started going as a visitor on the tours. That’s a fairly new\\ninvolvement. Will and Janel were here and I remember her name from living here before, but\\nagain, we hadn’t met. So it’s a relatively new acquaintance in that regard. Of course, now\\nsometimes I’m going to these various things [like the] SOFA [Sculptural Objects Functional Art\\n+ Design] craft show in Chicago and places like that and Janel will be there with her wood, her\\ncarving works, so she’s not just a ceramic association. Connee Mayeron was around in the days I\\nwas here and she was a participant in the Minnesota Crafts Council as well. But, I can’t say I’ve\\nhad a strong sense of her work. I haven’t known about what she’s doing at any given time in the\\nway that I have Jeff Oestreich, for example. That may just be a consequence of where she shows\\nor that sort of thing. Guillermo for me, of course, is a very recent acquaintance because he is the\\nmost recent here. I think it speaks really well of him that he was invited to become a part of the\\nTour as a new guy in town more or less.\\nAW: Do you think some of that was his connection with Warren? He was never a student but he\\nhad a connection with him.\\nJK: Right, right. Well when he was still at his home in South America, Warren was a guest there\\nand that’s when he met Warren for the first time. Then, as a consequence of their acquaintance\\nand Guillermo coming to visit Warren here he did meet other people. So he’s ended up, I forget\\nhow many of them, but definitely Linda went there and was a guest artist too. So they all had a\\nfar deeper history with him then just the rest of the people around here. I mean he’s relatively\\nnew in terms of moving here but not in terms of connection with some people associated with the\\nTour. Certainly that gave him a leg up. I don’t think somebody could just move to Minnesota and\\nbuy a studio someplace and expect to be included. They’d sort of have to earn the trust, you\\nknow? Earn their stripes or whatever. Who did I forget? Linda. I don’t think I knew here before\\neither, although I’ve known her name for a long, long time. I don’t remember meeting her long\\nago.\\n01:46:20\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n24\\nAW: Now what about any of the guest potters who come? Are there any guest potters who stand\\nout in your mind? Any you’ve been really excited that they have been part of the Tour?\\nJK: Oh yeah. When I was interviewing people for my pottery book and I would talk to other\\npeople elsewhere. Some of them would say forlornly, “I wish I could get invited to be there.” So,\\nI don’t know how everybody has decided on their own guests. Jeff [Oestreich] has had one of the\\nsmallest numbers of guests but he always has Pat [Burns] who was his apprentice at one point.\\nShe now lives in Oregon and she and her husband both pot so they always get to be guests at his\\nplace, but they are not as high profile as some of the other guests like Mark Shapiro, who comes\\nto Will Swanson’s. He’s been a really interesting person with a kind of funny history of how he\\ngot involved in clay, but he is very serious, you might almost say scholarly in his approach. He’s\\norganized a show of Karen Karnes, who is a major figure in mid-twentieth century functional\\npottery and is still living. He’s also particularly interested in a certain kind of New England folk\\npottery; he has collected examples of that. He has a reputation as a serious person in other ways\\nthan simply making. And his making also is quite thoughtful and interesting. He was a sculptor\\nat one point, but he also seems to have a literary bent. So I think it’s interesting and exciting to\\nhave that whole different bundle of influences and interests come and be represented here.\\nThere have also been a couple – and these are just sort of random associations that have popped\\ninto my head. If I’d seen a list I might have given you a more weighted and reasonable answer –\\nbut another person I was thinking of is Tom Turner who was also at Will’s, but just once. He’s a\\nkind of porcelain specialist and has developed these oxblood red glazes and he’s trying to do it\\nso you can have that kind of a traditional looking glaze but by being able to do it in an electric\\nkiln. He wants to do it chemically rather than through the fire achieving this effect. I’m probably\\nnot saying this very well because I’m not a technician and I might not have the exact\\nterminology right. Anyways, he was on the Tour not last year but maybe the year before or\\nsomething like that, and didn’t have a very good experience of it. His work is rather higher\\npriced than the other people he was showing with. He might have been better off at Connee’s\\nwhere things have a higher average price. But it was also less functional and I had met him at\\nthat time so we talked briefly and he said people kept saying “Well you can’t put flowers in it”\\nand “How would you clean it out?” So those are not his considerations. He makes vessels not so\\nthinking of function and so he ran into this audience prejudice here and didn’t sell that well and\\nhasn’t come back. It’s too bad because it’s a perfectly worthy body of work, it just didn’t suit the\\naura that this tour has developed. Oh gosh. There are so many people who visit. Who else can I\\nthink of?\\nThere are a bunch of the North Carolina potters. Suze Lindsay, Donna Polseno, and people like\\nthat who have a good market and a good response in their own region but have also fit in\\ncomfortably here and have done well and come back.\\n01:50:50\\nAW: On the topic of North Carolina, so generally, what have they said about selling here and\\nbeing here as part of the Tour in Minnesota? Compared to their audience in North Carolina it\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n25\\nsounds like a similar audience, maybe functional work. Why are those two places kind of in sync\\nwith each other?\\nJK: Well, they both are definitely centers of functional work.\\nAW: Have you noticed in just talking to them, have they made comparisons to what their\\nexperiences are in North Carolina versus here?\\nJK: Well, North Carolina doesn’t have a single population center of the size of the Twin Cities,\\nbut I guess people don’t mind driving because most of the potters I know are over in Western\\nNorth Carolina kind of clustered around Penland mostly or, I was going to say Asheville, but\\nPenland is really the heart of it. So people come from Raleigh but also from Charlotte, so they\\nare drawing from multiple areas, and Asheville has turned into a sophisticated, hipster town\\nstrangely enough. So that is probably a market as well, although the numbers might not be so\\ngreat, but if you add them all together it’s a pretty good population. North Carolina, traditionally,\\nwas just a place that had good clay, which is why you had so many potters there. A folk potter\\nwould set up where he could get his local material. Well that doesn’t have to be the case\\nanymore. A lot of people don’t use local clays. Certainly only a small segment are really\\ninterested in preparing their own clay and having that kind of specific relationship to the place\\nwhere they are. Just because there was clay there and there were folk potters there, and there\\nwas, again Penland, a school for crafts. So people would come and teach and Penland and like\\nthe beautiful area and set up there and the numbers would grow. I think it kind of works the same\\nway here. Once you have a person like Warren who teaches and then his students are around and\\nthey are doing work too. Then this becomes a center and it draws more at that point. I was trying\\nto think if I could make some distinction between the kind of work that is characteristic of the\\ntwo places and probably I really can’t. There are examples in both of earthy, tactile work and\\nalso more decorative painterly and more colorful. I’m not sure I could make a wholesale\\nseparation of the two areas. What else did you want me to address?\\nAW: Well that was just kind of it. I mean there have been a lot of comparisons along the way in\\ninterviews and with you about North Carolina so I just wanted to hear a little bit more if those\\npotters feel they can come to Minnesota and have a really good response similar to what they\\nwere having in North Carolina I was just curious about that.\\nJK: Well there is the orientation to function, which you wouldn’t get from everywhere. When I\\nwas doing my pottery interviews I would say that there are four main areas where I could hit the\\nlargest number of people doing functional work at once. One was Minnesota, another was North\\nCarolina, another was Maine and another was the area around the Archie Bray Foundation in\\nMontana. And the same thing has happened there. People have gone to the Bray, then ended up\\nbuying a house and staying on in that area. Montana, for a low population state, has considerable\\nceramic activity. Of course because that’s where Peter Voulkos and Rudy Autio started out there\\nat the Bray so there is that long of history. That was 1950, so there’s that long of history of\\nceramic activity there before he [Voulkos] went off to California. Rudy stayed in Montana and\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n26\\ntaught so you had subsequent generations too. Although he was not primarily doing functional\\nwork, he was primarily a sculptor in ceramics or other mediums.\\n01:55:45\\nAW: So what about the audience or audiences in North Carolina? How would you define the\\nNorth Carolina audience?\\nJK: Hmm. I don’t know. I don’t know if I could say. There is a long, I mean, because the folk\\npottery tradition continued there and there were some people vaguely associated with the pottery\\nfamilies because there were multiple generations of the same family of folk potters, some people\\nfrom those families began to collect and other people began to collect with a more historic\\norientation. The Mint Museum [in Charlotte] had a fine collection of historic ceramic examples\\nfrom North Carolina, so just anybody interested in the arts might have easily been exposed to\\nceramics as a part of that. I remember going into the Mint, which by that time had already been\\ndivided into a crafts and design building and then the old museum that had the traditional stuff in\\nit. I remember walking through the traditional galleries and seeing this ceramic work and saying,\\n“whose is that?” And it was something from the early twentieth century, a guy I’d never heard\\nof. He had been an itinerant journeyman potter, you know, in the old, old days who had more or\\nless in his old age set up his own pottery there and made very simple dark glaze, just beautiful\\nforms that were really reductive. I mean looking at them as an art critic and contemporary person\\nI was just, Ahhhh. Just amazed that somebody did work like that back then—beautiful stuff. So,\\nthere that is for anyone who is going to pay attention or stumble across. They do have, where\\nJugtown pottery is located in Seagrove, there is a big population of old folk pottery sites and\\nthen, I don’t even remember the number, but just a huge number of potters just in that area.\\nThat’s kind of vaguely midway between Raleigh and Charlotte. So easily you can drive from\\nboth those metropolitan areas to Seagrove. In fact there is even a road there, whatever the\\nhighway number that has signs along the roadside that say “Pottery Highway”.\\nAW: That makes it pretty clear.\\nJK: Maybe they should do that someplace in the St. Croix. You know maybe they should\\ndesignate a section of the interstate or something as “Pottery Highway.” They should think about\\nthis as a promotional device.\\nAW: Great idea.\\n01:59:50\\nWhat do you think the Tour has meant for the guest artists who come?\\nJK: A lot of them seem to just be amazed that there is this enthusiastic audience here. That\\nthey’re not having to beat the bushes or having to talk people into it by saying “You should be\\ninterested in this because--” and give them a spiel. They’ve just got this audience here now and\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n27\\nthat’s what is remarkable about it. I’m sure you’ve gotten these terms more specifically from\\nother people, but I hear in vague conversation that people get maybe a third of their year’s sales\\nout of this one event. So, it’s a big deal for the people who get to participate. It’s also that you\\nare together there with the other potters; it’s a social event. They all catch up with each other.\\nWhen I was coming from New York I would see, not every time, but I did on occasion see other\\npeople from New York who were here to see things. So the fact that it’s become such an event\\nand it’s an opportunity to network, as well as to collect, it’s just a nice thing to come to.\\nAW: As we know the Tour is not a juried event. Is that unusual for this kind of event?\\nJK: Well, since this is an artist-organized event, no. Essentially they are jurying among\\nthemselves. We don’t hear about it and they are not giving an award for anything, but anybody\\nwho is going to be invited as a guest the host has to be thinking, this person is representing me,\\nin a sense. If they invited somebody whose work is not very good it would reflect badly on them.\\nIt would maybe make the audience less likely to come. It would make the other hosts unhappy.\\nThat doesn’t mean people haven’t experimented. Bob had a woman from Scotland or someplace,\\nand Tom Turner would be an example of that too; somebody doing interesting work that wasn’t\\nthe standard. Still, it was very high quality. It didn’t work out for him but there doesn’t seem to\\nbe a problem with doing that. I think it is a jurying process but it’s just a little more intuitive or a\\nlittle more subjective to the hosts themselves. That’s why I was so curious about what would\\nhappen with this generational passing on. Did everybody on the Tour have to approve the person\\nwho is buying the studio?\\nAW: I don’t know.\\nJK: It’s hard enough to sell in the first place, but if you have to be judged by the other six as well\\nthen that is tricky. I think that means that each of them has to be really serious about this and feel\\nthat they are upholding a standard of quality. We hope not just a standard of taste or a bias of\\ntaste because there is good quality in all sorts of styles and appearances.\\n02:04:00\\nAW: What do you think about how the Tour will pass to the next generation? What do you think\\nwill happen to it in the future?\\nJK: I wonder. I don’t know because there definitely are younger people. Jason Trebs, for\\nexample, who shows at Bob’s place and has been his apprentice, he would be a fine person to be\\nthe next generation, but then it comes to does he want to live in the country? He now lives in St.\\nPaul. Does he have the money to buy a studio out there? Linda [Christianson] tells the story of\\njust practically cobbling together all kinds of things just managing to, living in houses that were\\nbarely suitable for habitation in order to get a foothold. Now that was a long time ago. Things\\nhave gotten more expensive. The great worry was that as the Twin Cities now has so many\\nbedroom communities out as far as Forrest Lake, which is getting really close to the Tour. I think\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n28\\nmaybe Jeff or somebody told me that there was some plan for a development out in the area\\nwhere some of the Tour sites are located, but it was, maybe, in ‘08 when the economy tanked.\\nSomething stopped it from happening. We have to hope now that gas doesn’t get cheaper\\nbecause if it does people would be more inclined to drive out that far and that would drive up the\\nprice of all the land there. Then what future would there be in this? So the future of the Tour is\\nkind of predicated on that land staying affordable.\\nIn the U. S. it’s really hard for anybody to set up a studio. England, for instance, has the Crafts\\nCouncil there that has what they call start-up grants, I think, and it’s for somebody who has\\ngotten out of graduate school to help them buy the studio equipment they need to get going\\nbecause it’s a tremendous burden to have to come up with all that. Young potters have tended to\\nkind of band together to share equipment in a shared studio space. There is a place like that in\\nAsheville where four potters work out of the same studio but they also sell out of it. They all\\nhave display areas in there. They’ve worked it out so at least one of them has to be there all the\\ntime so that the sales space is open. They’ve managed to work that out. So if that is the\\nbeginning way, how do you make the jump to having your own space? You either have to come\\ninto some money, or, as I was interviewing people some of the well established ones told me that\\ntheir parents gave them a mortgage. Their parents enabled them to buy a house that they would\\nalso use as a studio. There’s just no other way to do it. Unless you get an inheritance or you work\\na long time and save a very long time. But when you’re young, where are you going to come up\\nwith the money to do that?\\nSo, that means in terms of the future of the Tour, the tricky thing is somebody who is old enough\\nto be well established enough, Guillermo is an exception in that he needed to relocate, but mostly\\nif you get to that point in your career you’re going to stay where you are. You’re not going to\\nmove your studio. The next person to be part of the pottery tour either needs to start out there or,\\nit’s a complicated issue. It’s hard to see how it can work. I would say nothing ever stays the\\nsame. The pottery tour isn’t likely to last forever. Economic conditions, whatever, society is\\ngoing to change and there will be some reason for another answer, but at this moment in pottery\\neconomics, I guess you’d call it, in twenty-first century America what they are doing seems to be\\nthe best way.\\nFor functional ceramics to be in a gallery doesn’t really work very well because galleries have\\nhigh overhead and they need to sell things for high prices. So that’s not the good place for it to\\nbe. And if you’re just in a shop someplace then you don’t have the particular opportunity they do\\nto make individual objects that are special and that can be regarded as artworks in themselves. If\\nyou’re just selling in a shop that has racks full of similar stuff then you are closer to industry and\\nyou’re just producing a whole lot of things. For a studio potter, and the studio implies isolation\\nor being alone in that endeavor, the best way right now seems to be to sell from the studio\\nbecause then you don’t have to be paying someone else fifty percent. So we want the Tour to last\\nat this point at least until somebody figures out another way to make this economically feasible.\\nThese guys just all need to keep working and keep living for another couple of decades! Give us\\ntime.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n29\\n02:10:10\\nAW: Do you think that the personalities involved in setting up the Tour, the people who founded\\nit and are part of the core group, the hosts, is there something unique about their personalities\\nand way of doing this that has made it successful and can that be transferred? Can a new group\\nkind of put that together? Is that something to think about too? That it really comes down to\\nhaving someone like Bob who was able to organize and recruit everyone to be part of this tour\\nagain and again until it really started getting going?\\nJK: Well since I don’t know either of the Richards then, I don’t know what the dynamic was\\nthere. They also had the advantage that Warren was in it at the beginning so that would draw the\\ninitial crowd because his name was better known than anybody else’s. As I understand it he\\nwithdrew because he was getting too much attention and not the rest of the Tour. I don’t know\\nexactly what the story was but if so, that’s also generous of him to try to give the floor to these\\nnew speakers. So that’s a particular strength here that there was somebody like that who could\\nmentor the situation. I do think other places, like the area around Penland where there are a lot of\\npotters, I mean most potters that I meet, if you want to make a rash generalization, they are good\\nnatured, congenial; they are good people. You know? That question is whether you have\\nsomebody with organizational skills and business orientation to look after the details and the\\nability to work together as a group when it becomes a more complicated endeavor. I think you\\nhave good hearts there, as long as somebody has the other kinds of skills. It could happen\\nelsewhere.\\nAW: Do you think that is something that can be passed on?\\nJK: It would be good to think that you don’t have to just do this with your five best friends\\nbecause that would be pretty limiting. It just has to be somebody’s work you respect and that’s\\nenough. If they’re not all chummy the rest of the time, what does it matter? If the business\\nassociation works to the benefit of all of them. I don’t know the specifics enough in the other\\ncities because I don’t know all the involvement. I don’t even know who started the one in Austin.\\n02:15:00\\nAW: Do you think, and this is something Bob [Briscoe] had brought up as well, that mentoring is\\nreally the key to this transitioning to a new generation, as he is working with Jason Trebs? Do\\nyou think if the host potters continue to find people they are mentoring and think, oh maybe you\\ncould take on a role as a host eventually? Do you think that might be a method for passing it on\\nand retaining some of the core values?\\nJK: It is, but it still depends on the money. Unless some philanthropist decides to endow these\\nplaces or buy the St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour sites, and just let people pass them on. No, that’s\\nnot going to happen.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n30\\nAW: What do you think is replicable for the future? In terms of values, or mission or goals? At\\nthis point, having heard from everybody, they are wrestling with this now and trying to figure out\\nhow this will work. Not only how but what will be passed on? Will it be the physical sites or will\\nit be the philosophy and values of functional pottery? As you’ve pointed out if the land price\\nincreases that could really exclude a lot of people from settling there and then that regional\\nlocation which has been so important to the identity of the Tour could go away.\\nJK: Did they tell you, or, I was thinking that at one point there was somebody on the Tour who\\nwas further away, who was further north. Or maybe they just thought that person could be in\\nthere but then it was not geographically tight enough to really work as part of the Tour. The way\\nthe Tour is now you can do it in a day, particularly if you don’t know a lot of people and aren’t\\nconstantly stopping to talk you can get to all seven sites and get back to the city without great\\nstrain. If they were more strung out, so you were really driving a longer distance, it would be\\nproblematic. I think that issue came up at some point. Or maybe it was just discussed and they\\ndecided not to do it. Bob would be the one that would know. Maybe I heard that from him.\\nAW: Yeah, I think they had people kind of on either edge they were considering or were maybe\\nalso considering being part of it in the very beginning and then decided not to and then they\\nrealized that having all the studios in close proximity to each other and making it easier for\\nvisitors to travel around was an important part of the success. I think they’ve stuck to that.\\nJK: I wouldn’t necessarily imagine that the individual locations, that Bob’s studio itself, must be\\non the Tour. I mean they could do the Tour with six instead of seven. That could disappear. If the\\nnumber gets down by a lot, then it makes it less of an attraction. Why drive all the way out there\\nif you’re only going to go to one place? You’d have to be really dedicated. A certain number is\\nreally useful. When you think about how he’s got that studio, he’s got everything there set up, he\\ncertainly wants to pass that on to another potter. It would seem like such a crazy waste for it to\\njust become a house or just a residence. In terms of the perpetuation, the legacy of the pottery\\ntour, I don’t necessarily see the individual locations being that important. I think it’s just the idea\\nthat these are people doing something that gives them great joy basically and that also serves\\nothers serves a kind of greater public good. That they’ve found a way to sustain that, that’s what\\nis important about it.\\n2:19:55\\nAW: Nicely put. You said a little while ago you were thinking through what it was about the\\nopen-air kind of situation where visitors get to meet the artists themselves and buy their stuff.\\nCan you reflect a little bit more about that? Why do you think that’s attractive to visitors and\\nconsumers of pottery?\\nJK: I think it’s attractive to a lot of people who don’t even think of themselves as following art.\\nThey think, Oh, art is some strange person that they don’t have an immediate acquaintance with.\\nYet, visiting an artist’s studio is fascinating because you’re getting a glimpse into another world,\\na world of creativity I think lots more of us aspire to that creativity than actually live it. So to be\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n31\\nable to go, even though in most cases you’re not going into the house of the person – Bob’s used\\nto be the exception because he would have food in the house and you would get into the one little\\ncorner of it – you’re not seeing intimately how they live, but you are seeing how they work and\\nthe environment in which they’re in.\\nWhen you started saying this about “open air” I didn’t know where you were going with the\\nquestion at that point, but I was thinking that one of the years I went to the Tour when I was just\\nvisiting here, I was staying with my daughter, well it must have been four years ago because my\\ngranddaughter wanted to go with me and I said, “Oh I don’t know. I’m going to be gone all day\\nyou might get tired” you know, I tried to discourage her. Anyway, she did go with me and it\\nworked out very nicely actually. Particularly Will and Janel, they raise rabbits so they pulled out\\na baby bunny for her to hold. Then, she [granddaughter] had some money, ten dollars of her\\nown, and she thought she was going to buy a piece of pottery. There is nothing really for ten\\ndollars, but when Janel heard this she said, “Anything on this shelf you can choose” and she just\\naltered the price so my granddaughter could buy it. Anyway that really wasn’t my point, I got\\ndistracted here. The point was that particular year there had been a horrendous amount of rain\\nand everything was muddy, everyplace was muddy. When I was going, I thought they probably\\nwouldn’t get a very good turnout because it’s going to be a mucky mess with all those dirt roads\\nout there. But they had a great turnout. People still came. Just the idea of getting out, and maybe\\nthat made it more of a funny story or more of an adventure. You know, wallowing in the mud\\nand having your pants all splashed with stuff from getting in and out of the car. Open air in that\\nsense makes it an experience. Not that I would wish it to be that way every year!\\nAW: Yeah, how has weather affected the Tour? Have you ever seen less of an audience because\\nof the weather, or is it always like you’ve been saying, when it’s rainy and muddy you still have\\na lot of people?\\nJK: Did that come up when talking with anybody?\\nAW: Well everyone had a weather story, but I guess as a more general question, how do you\\nthink weather affects the Tour?\\nJK: Well it could apply to the [Minnesota] State Fair going on now too. If it’s ninety degrees, do\\nthey get fewer people? With high humidity do they get fewer people? I don’t know. There’s\\nalways going to be those people who decide they are going to go and they are going to go no\\nmatter what the weather is. Surely on a beautiful day, especially in the spring, when you want to\\nget out, if the weather is good I would imagine it would bring them more of a crowd, but I don’t\\nknow. I have not noticed in the, however many I’ve gone to, definitely maybe six or something\\nlike that it always seems to be a good crowd. Even on Fridays when you think, why aren’t these\\npeople at work? You know? (laughs) I had the idea that I wanted to go on Friday so it wouldn’t\\nbe such a mob scene but whew, maybe just because it’s the first day there are still lots of people\\nwho come. They must take the day off. They’re not all retired for sure.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n32\\nAW: What is it about the Tour that you like? What do you like about going? Your own\\nexperience – what is it that keeps bringing you back? Is it the open air, the adventure, the potters,\\nmeeting them and talking with them?\\nJK: Well, you’d think that it would be that I like to see all these potters, a fair portion of whom\\nI’ve met before, but I think with me it’s that I like the work. I like looking at work and I like\\nhandling it. Sometimes I have to pretend like I haven’t seen somebody because if I talk to\\neverybody I don’t get to look at the stuff. You know? You’re trying to examine somebody’s new\\nwork and they show up and you’re chit chatting. Under those circumstances I can’t give the same\\nattention to the object. I like coming home with a couple of new pieces so it’s really the work.\\nThat being said, I do look upon this as an institution here and it’s an institution that I hope will\\ngo on so I do think of my presence as a vote in favor or an endorsement as a contribution to there\\nbeing a future to this event.\\n02:26:10\\nAW: Are there other pottery events in Minnesota that you make sure you get to every year or that\\nyou hold as an attractive event for you?\\nJK: The other kind of obvious bookend to this is the American Pottery Festival at Northern Clay\\nwhich is coming up in just a couple of weeks. There’s a big sale, there is lots of work there but\\nthe day-to-day activities are more workshops and a lot of people demonstrating work. At first I\\nthought, I’m not a maker and I don’t want to go to those, but it’s actually not too bad sitting in on\\nthose too because they talk while they are working and so you’re still getting a glimpse of\\nsomebody’s character and what they’ve been doing. There are also a lot of little slide talks that\\nyou can go to as well if you want a background of some artist. So I like them both and I attend\\nthem both, but I think there is something more special about the Tour, just because you are out\\nand you are on the potters’ home territories. If I were introducing somebody here to the idea of\\nparticipating, it would be the pottery tour that I would recommend first, then if you have an\\nestablished interest you might want to check out the festival at Northern Clay. They both are\\nbringing in artists from elsewhere, so in terms of being exposed to new people and new\\ninformation and work, they both are really great in that regard. Which also helps to make a more\\nsophisticated audience here. So you’re not just dealing with the same couple of local people and\\nthat’s all.\\n02:30:00\\nAW: I think you have covered a lot of the stuff, and I think we’re now just on the reflection\\nquestions if that is okay. So what has pottery meant in your life?\\nJK: Oh. This sounds like an essay subject. Ah, what would I say? Well, it has meant, let’s say\\nutility, art and community. Really from the first moment that I became aware of what was going\\non here and involved in this, I mean, the community of people is really an issue. Even (laughs)\\nthe way I’ve gotten on Facebook. I have two Facebook sites, one is just family and really old\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n33\\nfriends, a very small number, and then the other is sort of the public person, the writer and all\\nthat. And what I find myself doing, I get friend-ed by people I’ve never heard of or don’t know\\nanything about. Well, if someone’s in ceramics I’ll say “yes”, but if they are a painter I want to\\nsee the work. I want to see if I should bother to friend this person. So pottery has, well ceramics\\nin general, has so engrained itself into my experience that a ceramic artist is presumed friendly\\nuntil proven otherwise.\\nAW: Have you ever made pottery yourself? Or are you involved in crafts?\\nJK: Not really. Other than that horrible hobby shop stuff when I was a child. I did, at one point,\\ntake a class in hand building at a community college where I happened to be living at the time. It\\nwas just because, that was after I had been living in Minnesota and we had moved on to Illinois,\\nand that was just to have a little bit better sense about it, but I’ve never even tried throwing. So I\\nreally got interested in art visually and intellectually, I guess you’d say. At that point I couldn’t\\nsee trying to pursue actually doing it because I already knew there was all this other work and I\\nthought, why bother? There are all these other interesting things.\\nAW: I think someone had mentioned that you do some craft making or production of some kind,\\nnot in ceramics but in other areas?\\nJK: I would say not so. In my life I used to sew, so I made clothes for my children and for\\nmyself, but I haven’t done that in years. I also used to embroider decoratively. I took a weaving\\nclass once. I took a painting class once, but I’ve not tried to pursue these things. I mean I’m\\ninterested in doing things. I am an avid gardener and I am a hands-on home repair person, but in\\nboth cases I say I’m best at things that don’t take strength or skill and that just take dogged\\npersistence. So that’s what I do. I dig out honeysuckle stumps and stuff like that. I really think\\nmy orientation is editing, which I have done in journalistic ways. I think I’m much better at\\nlooking at something that is already done and figuring out how to make it better or diddling with\\nit rather than actual real creation of something new. I don’t think I have a gift for that in much of\\nanything that I can think about, I mean, even being an art critic, it’s not like being a novelist\\nwhere you make up a world. To be an art critic is to deal with something that already exists and\\ntalking about it.\\nAW: How do you see yourself in the recent history of ceramics in America? You’ve been writing\\nabout ceramics for several decades, so what do you think your role has been?\\n02:35:00\\nJK: Well, I think I got way lots of mileage out of the fact that I was a person at an art magazine\\nwho was interested in ceramics. So I got lots of attention from the craft field. There was a time\\nwhen I was first at Art in America I guess I’d say that my coworkers there probably saw this\\ninterest in crafts as, kind of, aberration. I don’t know, slumming even. It wasn’t anything that got\\nme a job or got me credit in the art world, but I don’t think that’s the case anymore. Particularly\\nbecause of the widespread interest in clay in the art world in general and the fact that all these\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n34\\npeople are dabbling in it just to find out about the material and the sense of touch. Also,\\nsometimes because they’re interested in function and trying to make functional objects. So,\\nwhere was I going with this?\\nAW: Well do you think you had a role in shaping an awareness about ceramics?\\nJK: It would be nice to think, but I’ve never really tracked how things came to attention. I mean I\\nguess a writer about art always wants to think that. I’ve been more interested in writing about the\\nunderdog and the unknown and the emerging, and so I like to think that I brought attention to\\nsomebody that then other people will recognize the validity of the medium or that particular\\nartist. But I don’t know if you can prove that and I don’t know if anybody’s going to put me on\\nthe list of most influential writers. Well partly, maybe it’s a female thing, but I have not been\\nvery interested in just calling attention to myself and I can’t do the performance kind of stuff\\nwhich Garth Clark, for instance, is a master of carrying his audience. It’s a skill, but it’s not a\\nskill that I have been interested in developing.\\nI basically did all this for my own satisfaction, because I like looking at the work and because I\\nsee better if I know I’m going to write about something. I pay attention in some kind of a more\\nacute way. I can go see a show in a museum and think that I’m looking at it carefully and paying\\nattention, but if I’m not going to be writing about it I just don’t have the acuteness of observation\\nor the retention I guess either. So I like to write because that’s my way of engaging with the\\nobject and really experiencing whatever the artwork is, or the event, or performance, too. I guess\\nI do know that the only time there have ever been articles in Art in America about jewelry I\\nwrote them. Only twice that I know of and that’s not an easy one, it was easier to get ceramics in.\\nSo, you know, I hope that some more readiness to accept the great variety of aesthetic creativity\\nthat we have in our culture, that it doesn’t have to be just this narrow definition of painting and\\nsculpture and photography and video and whatever else qualifies at the moment. I think that’s the\\nway things have been going in general, is to be more broadly accepting.\\nI mean it used to be that nobody was interested in Latin American work, and multicultural art\\ncoverage has been a broadening of the field for everybody, so I think this is just another little\\ninstance of more receptivity to working in a different medium or with a different set of criteria\\nthan there might have been at one time. Although there hasn’t, just for the record, there hasn’t\\nalways been a bias against this work either. If you read early twentieth century art magazines\\nyou’ll find blacksmithing and metalsmithing gates, you’ll find the whole spectrum of creative\\nactivity at that time. So the narrowness, the bias, of thinking that art could only be one thing, was\\njust a certain mid-century phenomenon that we’ve gotten past now.\\n02:40:00\\nJK: I think probably the most important thing I’ve contributed to the field is the Makers book.\\nJust the fact that there is a history, I mean, I don’t expect that to be the last word by any means\\nbecause we had a hard time finding some of that history. That’s also another thing that has\\nchanged. The scholarly approach to this field has gotten better over the last several decades due\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n35\\nin part to some older decorative arts programs but also some new ones, like the Bard [Graduate]\\nCenter in New York, which is also a decorative arts program. So there are young scholars who\\nhave come through those kinds of programs. Yale has also been, their art history program has\\nproduced some of the younger scholars who are interested in contemporary crafts; textiles,\\nceramics, wood, whatever it happens to be. There has been more of a sense of seeing that this is a\\nhistory, a philosophy of work that is worthy of the same kind of exploration as painting or\\nsculpture. So, you don’t always have to say that the old times were better. I mean I actually think\\nthe present times are better in this regard.\\nAW: In terms of what exactly? What makes this time a better time for crafts or appreciation of\\ncraft?\\nJK: That things are not so narrow. That an artist can work in any way that he or she wishes.\\nMuseums still have this problem with categories, you know they have their departments and\\nsometimes it’s a dumb fit. There are people who work in clay who are absolutely not decorative\\nartists. They are just artists like any other contemporary artists. It’s silly to say on the basis of\\nmedium, that’s one of the places where there seems to be a structural bias that presents a problem\\nfor craft is in museums. Other than that I think a lot of barriers have fallen in scholarly and\\ncreative activities. Anything that is persuasive in and of itself that persuades you of its\\nearnestness, its attraction, its validity.\\nAW: Anything else to add to the bigger question of what the Tour has meant for the hosts or for\\nthe guest artists? You’ve talked about this as an important source of income, as a source for\\nsocializing and networking, and things like that. Anything else to add?\\nJK: Well, I think the Tour founders in choosing Mother’s Day weekend to do this were pretty\\nsmart. I mean somebody else might have thought of that and there are probably other Mother’s\\nDay activities, you know, art fairs or other things like that. That has worked well, so that\\nparticular timing has been adopted. The idea of getting out in the spring to do something like that\\nand maybe the assumption that mother is the one more likely to want to do it and she can say,\\n“Well, it’s my day, we’re going to go on the Tour.” Maybe there might be a kind of effect of the\\nTour as a model in other senses. I can’t give you evidence of this, but Mark Shapiro, who I\\nmentioned is in Massachusetts, there’s a four person kind of tour there or some sort of a group\\nshow that goes on and he has had a couple of other people at his site when they do that. I don’t\\nknow the history or the timing but my guess would be that you could look at something like what\\ngoes on in this studio tour and say, “Well, I could do this on a smaller scale if I’m having an\\nassociated open day with a couple of other people I could also have guests come in.” That might\\nbe something that people had not so commonly done before. I’m just guessing.\\nOther important things, well, money and socialization both seem like really important things.\\n02:45:10\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n36\\nAW: Do you think it’s really solidified their careers in a way over the decades? I mean some\\ncame in pretty well established and I think for others they were getting established as the Tour\\nstarted in the early nineties they were still in early-mid career.\\nJK: I’m not sure. I don’t know if the Tour, certainly in a local sense the tour gives credibility.\\nThe fact that this young man, Jason Trebs, shows on the tour with a lot of other people locally\\nthat has to be an endorsement of his work that is important. I don’t know if that has gained him\\nanything nationally. I don’t know if the ceramic magazines, they don’t cover the Tour as a\\nreporting activity, so people in other parts of the country might not even know who is doing it\\nhere, so I’m not sure that would contribute to anybody’s standing in the field. Although if you\\nread down a bio and they are showing here and you know that the Tour is an institution then that\\nhas to be a good point. A feather in somebody’s cap that they’ve done that, but I think that\\nbecause it’s a local exposure instead of a national one that I can’t quite imagine that it would\\nmake anybody’s reputation in terms of reputation. If they sell very well then that success carries\\nthem on, but you just don’t get national press for this. It doesn’t get written up in the New York\\nTimes or something. It could, sometime, why not? It would make a nice human-interest story.\\nAW: Have other tours gotten written up, similar to this one?\\nJK: Not that I know of.\\nAW: Or are tours still, well, as you were talking I was thinking of something that Bob and others\\nhave really appreciated is the Minnesota Public Radio’s coverage of the Tour. They point to that\\nas a great promotional opportunity.\\nJK: But that was Minnesota, not national. Right?\\nAW: Um-hm.\\nI think there were a couple of years where someone was interviewed from the Tour about it. I’m\\nunsure how that all works, but they do definitely have some time on public radio and that seems\\nto have been one of the big promotional activities that has really helped their tour—along with\\nthe color poster. Once they switched from a basic, black and white or maybe just a basic print\\ntrifold brochure to a full color poster that seemed to double the audience.\\nJK: That made a big difference? Very interesting.\\nAW: Yes. Kind of these very simple promotion materials, but when done well all of a sudden\\nyou can double or triple the audience.\\nJK: I like the one where they are all sitting at the table. I actually use that in a talk that I’ve given\\nabout pottery. That’s interesting to hear.\\nAW: What do you think the Tour means for the broader Minnesota community?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n37\\nJK: Well, for anybody who knows about the arts in Minnesota, whatever your local specialty is,\\nit [St. Croix River Valley Tour] is a point of pride. Certainly that has to have something to do\\nwith that point of identification of the character of the state. But in saying that, I think there are\\nprobably plenty of people who just go hunting and fishing and stuff and don’t know anything\\nabout there being pottery here. I’m not sure and I don’t have any reason to think that the average\\nMinnesota citizen would even know that this existed. I think it’s within a selected, either\\nspecifically art-oriented, or just the people who like to, you know, just the kind of people who\\nwant to go to the national parks and just check out the things that are exceptional. Then when\\nyou have this kind of an event they would be somebody who was aware of that and be glad to\\ncheck it out. Unfortunately, in our whole culture at large, I think the support of art is still a pretty\\nspecialized activity. Even though nearly everybody has some kind of creative thing that they do,\\neven if it’s working on their cars or tying flies or whatever.\\n02:50:46\\nAW: Or gardening?\\nJK: (laughs) Yeah.\\nAW: So, as a wrap up question, what is the state of ceramics today, thinking about Minnesota\\nspecifically?\\nJK: In the nineties, right at the end of the century, I think there was a sense in the crafts field,\\nyes, I think I’m right saying in crafts and not art as a whole, a feeling that things were just kind\\nof weakening or petering out. That there had been this huge blossoming of the crafts starting in\\nthe sixties with the baby boom generation and that they were all getting older and that the college\\nteaching programs were shrinking and that, oh dear, everything’s on the downhill slide. Then all\\nof a sudden you get into this new century and things, all sort of surprising things come up, like\\ndigital printing. That kind of surprise, and it seems to me that there has been a lot of creative\\nactivity in all the crafts fields within the last decade, within this century.\\nI also, well part of the reason I wanted to work on this pottery book was that I had a feeling that\\nthe ceramics field at large was finding more acceptance as either figural sculptures or as vessels,\\nwhich were not functional but are sculptural vessels. And that the ceramics field itself was a little\\ndown on function and thought it wasn’t very important. They were swallowing the old kind of\\nmind poisoning stuff from the art world. I wanted to work on this because that’s not my\\nperception of how it is at all. I see lots of creative work, [artists] making new forms of ceramic\\nwork that are still utilitarian. And gosh, I interviewed a hundred and sixty people and stopped\\njust because I have twice as many as I can possibly deal with in this book. Even so, I keep\\nstumbling across another person thinking, oh, why didn’t I meet them sooner, why didn’t I see\\nthat work sooner, because it’s absolutely of a caliber that I would wish to consider. So, you\\nknow, I feel that there are all kind of riches of great work going on; all kinds of things being\\ndone. Back to Garth Clark again. Did I mention this last time? I can’t remember. He only went to\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Koplos\\n08/20/14\\n38\\nNorth Carolina like a year ago or something and he had never been there before and so now,\\nsuddenly, this guy who is quite influential in the field and had been saying all these negative\\nthings, the kind of “nobody can make a living as a potter” that kind of rigmarole, and he met\\nplenty of people in North Carolina. I don’t know if he has ever been here. Maybe he should get\\ninvited. So, now he’s talking about function as a legitimate expression today. I just think the\\nwhole stigma, or uncertainty maybe, about the status of that kind of work is dissolving. I think it\\nis a great moment. It’s exciting. It also has that potential we already discussed that there is a\\ngenerational change operating, so, it has to work its way out somehow.\\nAW: Is there anything else you want to add about the Tour?\\nJK: Have you got food in there?\\nAW: You’ve mentioned it a little bit. Do you want to say a few words about that? Many others\\nhave talked about that as well so it would be good to hear your perspective.\\nJK: I actually think that’s part of this sense of welcoming and socialization, the fact that there is\\nfood there. I keep wondering how the individual people who do it can possibly afford to provide\\nthat stuff. Well, maybe they can’t because Bob [Briscoe] pulled back on that this year and Jeff\\n[Oestreich], as well, had a food truck there. And I don’t have any idea how those worked,\\nwhether they made enough money to make it worth while as a food truck. But just the sense of\\ninclusiveness, it makes it more of a kind of party atmosphere that here is this stuff that you can\\nshare. You don’t have to pay for everything, it’s not like you’re just coming to take the money\\nout of your pocket. Like you feel with the airlines nowadays where every time you turn around\\nthey’re going to charge you for something again. This is just cordiality and welcoming. I think\\nit’s very nice that they have done that and I hope that they can manage to continue to pull it off.\\nYeah, that’s it. The end?\\nAW: Yes, that’s a very nice note to end on. Thank you very much for your interview.

This\\ninterview is for the A Measure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River\\nValley, made possible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage grants. Also present\\nduring this interview is Tierney McNabb our project assistant. Warren, thank you so much for\\nagreeing to be interviewed. Why don’t we get started? If you could tell us about where and when\\nyou were born? Where you grew up?\\nWM: I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1924. My father was a traveling salesman and he\\ngot transferred around a great deal so we moved from Missouri to Philadelphia and then a few\\nyears later to Chicago, Illinois. We never lived in big cities. We always tried to live in a suburb.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n2\\nIn Chicago we lived in a little town called Wilmette, which is north of Chicago on the lake. It\\nwas there that I got involved with art really seriously. I was lucky because I had an art teacher—I\\ntried for a scholarship at the Chicago Art Institute, but I was going to be a painter in those days.\\nEveryone who did anything in art was going to be a painter. Nobody thought about metal work\\nor ceramics textiles or anything—it was all painting. I tried for a scholarship and didn’t get one. I\\ndid get one to another art school, but my teacher advised me that it wasn’t a very good art school\\ntherefore I should get to the Chicago Art Institute. My parents agreed to finance the first year but\\nfinancing the first year in those days was very inexpensive. It cost four hundred dollars for\\ntuition and all the necessary things I needed to go to school. They financed me for the first year\\nand I was lucky to get a scholarship for my second year but always with the anticipation that I\\nwas going to be a painter.\\nThen I got drafted into the army in the Second World War. In the army I never saw combat\\nbecause right after I was drafted and put into training as a truck driver a group of us were called\\nto the general’s office; the only thing that we could think of that was in common was that\\neveryone has something about art in their background. It wasn’t only art—one guy was a sign\\npainter, another guy was a house painter, but anything with paint. Anyway, what happened was\\nthat the drafting of soldiers had become so rapid that the government printing office could not\\nkeep up with printing instruction manuals and that sort of thing. They decided to start some small\\nprinting workshops in various areas of the country. I was down in Fort Hood, Texas, and they\\ndecided to make one there. We did make this workshop and I worked there all during the war\\nuntil the Battle of the Bulge. When the Battle of the Bulge came along, everyone who was\\nnoncritical to the Army was reassigned. We went through re-training and we were to go to\\nFrance and relieve those soldiers or help fight the Battle of the Bulge. Well I had checked in all\\nmy materials and was ready to go home on a two-day leave before reporting to the port where we\\nwould ship out. The sergeant called me back and said, “You better pick up all your gear because\\nyou’re not going.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Your eyes are too bad.” Without my glasses I cannot\\nsee at a long distance. I would have been a danger to my own comrades. I was put back into a\\nshop printing and so on and did that for the rest of the war. When the war was over they took all\\nof us who were nonessential again and shipped us overseas to replace the guys who were\\nfighting. I was lucky; I was sent to Japan. While in Japan I met a lot of Japanese artists and so on\\nand gallery owners. We didn’t have much money but what we could buy that was available were\\nJapanese prints and so we bought Japanese prints and so forth. That was the end of my army\\ncareer.\\n00:06:30\\nI went back to school when I was released finally and I thought, Ok I’ll pick up my painting\\nstudies. I went to the Chicago Art Institute and I said, “I want to re-register for my painting\\nclasses.” They said, “We’re sorry, there is no room in the painting classes,” because all the\\nreturning GIs were taking advantage of the G. I. Bill of Rights and if they wanted to they went to\\nschool, and many of them went to art schools because there were a lot of artists it so happened. I\\nsaid, “Well, if painting is not open, what is open?” They said, “Well, you could take fashion\\ndesign or ceramics. Both of those are open.” I said, “All right, I’ll take ceramics and eventually\\nI’ll finish my painting instruction.” I got into the ceramics class and, I have to be honest with\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n3\\nyou, we found out it was not a good ceramics class. The Art Institute of Chicago was a great\\nschool for painting, not ceramics, at that time. It’s since changed and it has a very good ceramics\\nprogram now, so I don’t want it to sound like I’m damning the Art Institute for all time. But\\nanyway a group of people were in this class and we were told what to do. We would spend three\\ndays making a pot with coils of clay and the closer it came to an industrial pot the better the\\ninstructor thought it was. One day one of the students came running into the class and she was\\nwaving a book she had just bought and she said, “I’ve got this book. It’s by a man named\\nBernard Leach, a British potter, and it tells how he started out and it’s much better than what\\nwe’re doing.” Fortunately the instructor in the ceramics class was there only three days a week,\\nso on the other four days we could get into the ceramics studio and try to do what Leach said was\\nthe way to make pots. We did that.\\nIt was there I met my first wife. She was also in the ceramics class. She was there because she\\nwas teaching in a Mexican settlement house on the west side of Chicago. She thought that the\\nkids would be more excited by mucking around with clay than they would by drawing with\\npencils, which was all they had. She took ceramics although she was a painter, also. That’s\\nwhere I met her and we got married.\\n00:10:00\\nWhen we got out of school we tried to set up a pottery; disaster, absolute disaster. We finally\\ndecided we needed more training and we wrote to Bernard Leach, told him our background, and\\nasked if we could apprentice at his studio. He said, “Well, I really have to see what you do and\\nI’d like to meet you.” So we managed to save up enough money to get a cheap flight to England\\nand we met Leach and we took some of our work with us and showed it. Of course, the first\\nthing he said when he saw our work, “I’m sorry, we’re full up.” (Laughs) This really knocked us\\nout for a while, but we had a week’s reservation in a bed and breakfast so we asked if we could\\ncome up everyday and watch what was doing and talk to the people who were working there and\\nso on and perhaps learn as much as we could. He said, “That was fine,” and we did that and we\\ndid learn a lot. At the end of the week Bernard said, “We’re firing our large kiln this weekend”—\\nhe was still sitting a kiln watch. It was an oil-fired kiln, a three-chamber—what’s called a\\nNoborigama—which one chamber feeds into the next and into the next and out the chimney.\\nBernard said he was still sitting a kiln watch and did we want to come up and talk because it\\nwould be our last chance to visit with him. Of course we said, “Yes.” He then told us his kiln\\nwatch was from 1:00am to 4:00am. That didn’t stop us. We went back and took a nap and then\\nwalked up to the pottery at 1:00 o’clock. We talked from 1:00am to 8:00am. We never talked\\nabout pots, which is the interesting thing. All I can say is that Leach wanted to find out what kind\\nof people we were. We talked about economics, we talked about social problems, government—\\neverything that came up we just chatted over it. At the end of that time he said, “I’ve changed my\\nmind. You can come back and work in the studio.”\\nWe had to go back to America because we had a commitment to teach in a little art school in St.\\nPaul, which we had been teaching at. We went back and taught and then returned to England and\\nwe stayed for two years. We were very lucky; Leach had been in America giving a series of\\ntalks, lectures, and we knew that he was here and we arranged to go on the same boat with him\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n4\\ngoing back to England. We spent six wonderful days talking about anything that came to our\\nmind, and pottery was certainly top in those discussions because he had already accepted us.\\nWhen we got to Southampton, Bernard said, “Do you have a place to stay?” We said, “No, but\\nwe’d find a bed and breakfast.” And he said, “Do you want to live with me?” He had just\\ndivorced his third wife and couldn’t manage to live alone. He couldn’t stand living alone because\\nhe’s a very communicative person and he always has to have someone to test ideas off and so on.\\nSo we lived with him for two years and that was really great. We got to know him. We got to see\\nhis whole collection. We got to use the pots in the house for meals. At the end of that time,\\nLeach knew that we were going to try and start our own pottery and so he encouraged us to come\\nin on the evenings and weekends and make our own work in the studio, which was fired in the\\nkiln. We encouraged some of the other young guys who worked at the pottery to do the same\\nthing. Eventually we had a big show of all the pots, which we’d made all together. It was fun. It\\nwas not a great success but it was fun.\\n00:15:50\\nWe returned home and we went back to St. Paul. We went back and were teaching in this little\\nart school, which is not a very good school, but trying to get out of it. I kept asking the\\nUniversity [University of Minnesota] if they had an opening in their art department. It so\\nhappened that the University was revising their art department and there was a man in charge\\nwho had been given the authority to hire anyone he wanted without doing a nationwide search,\\nthe way they have to do now. He had seen our work from when we had been working in St. Paul,\\nand it was better than what the woman who was teaching there was doing. He said, “There is this\\nwoman, but she’s on her way out.” She was a Bauhaus trained person, but the Bauhaus didn’t\\nhave a ceramics section. She wasn’t trained at the Bauhaus, she was trained at the School of\\nDesign in Chicago, and that was run by Moholy-Nagy who was trained at the Bauhaus and was\\npart of the Bauhaus in Germany. Her method of teaching we have to talk about. All the students\\nbrought in a square paper milk carton and they filled it with plaster of Paris. When it hardened\\nthey peeled off the paper and then they took chisels and files and knives and so on and tried to\\ncarve this block of plaster into a ceramic form. After they did that they made a mold around it\\nand then they slip cast pots in that mold. They had two glazes they could use—one was white\\nand one was black. This really didn’t sit well with the American students. She managed to drop\\nthe enrollment from three full sections of twenty-four students each to one section of about five\\nstudents. That was why she was on her way out. He offered me the job and I, of course, was very\\nhappy to have it. He also said, “If there’s a cut in the budget, or if you do not raise the enrollment\\nof the classes, then you’re out.” But that was better than what I was doing at the time so I said,\\n“Ok, I’ll take the chance.” The classes did go up and they didn’t get a cut in the budget, so I was\\nthere for the rest of my teaching career.\\n00:19:00\\nEventually things happened. My wife died while I was teaching there. We had two children. We\\nwere living in an apartment in St. Paul. Wait a minute; I’m missing something here. When we\\ncame back from England I got this job teaching at the University but we wanted to start our own\\npottery. We knew we wanted to have a big kiln like they had at the Leach pottery. It would\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n5\\nprobably be oil-fired because that was the only kiln we had fired with. We had two choices—if\\nyou want to have a big kiln with black smoke coming out of the top there’s two places where you\\ncan work: you can work in the country or you can work in the industrial section of town. We\\nchose the country and we managed to find the place—where I’m still living—in an ad in the\\nnewspaper. We did buy this place. It’s much more than we need because it had a home on it—at\\nleast a primitive house, a simple house. It had a garage. It had a machine shed. It had a big barn\\nwhere we could convert it to a studio. It had forty-five acres of land, which is more than any\\npotter needs. In fact, it’s too much. We bought it and we got it for practically nothing at that\\ntime; this was 1953, just after we returned from England. Anyhow, we moved out here and we\\nstarted our pottery. We were pretty successful and after that I did switch over to the University\\nteaching. I must say teaching in a University is a great thing because you do have an audience\\nwho are receptive to ideas. I think that was probably what really got things started here around\\nSt. Paul/Minneapolis because a lot of people were very excited about learning to make functional\\npottery, which we were determined we were going to make—not art, but functional pottery. We\\nhad a lot of students and they in turn went out and taught in other schools, locally here, and that\\nwas where the beginning of things that were really happening in St. Paul occurred. When we first\\nmoved to St. Paul there was one other potter and she was the wife of a professor in Hamline\\nUniversity. She was stuck with the idea that she had to make pots out of clay that she dug\\nherself. The only clay that she could find around St. Paul was a brick factory across the river\\nfrom the city of St. Paul, where she got lots of clay but it was great for bricks and no good for\\npots. She struggled with that and kept at it all the time that we knew her, but the pots would warp\\nand crack and do all sorts of nasty things. She was not a great influence on the surrounding\\nneighborhood, but we were good friends.\\nAfter my wife died I stayed on here and I got kind of fed up working alone. I tried taking on an\\napprentice and I got a very good man who was an apprentice two years with me. He did his own\\nwork; he didn’t do my pots but he did his pots. But he helped out in the studio mixing the clay,\\npacking the kiln, and firing the kiln, all those things. The only thing was that I was not geared to\\nworking with someone who I was not familiar with in the same room. When he left after two\\nyears I never had another apprentice. But then I got to be kind of lonely for contact and talk and\\nso I had the idea and I got to know a lot of well-known potters around the country and I would\\nask them if they would come for a week in the summer. They would all work here and we’d pack\\nthe big kiln and fire the pots and then have a giant sale in the yard where everyone’s work was\\nout for sale. I think that’s the closest I come to a beginning for what eventually became the St.\\nCroix Valley Pottery Tour. I was never involved with it, but I think people took the idea of a\\ngroup of people gathering their work together and getting a larger audience that way. I believe it\\nwas Bob Briscoe who actually started the St. Croix Pottery Tour. I was not a part of that because\\nI could sell all my work that I wanted here in the studio.\\nOver the years also, I’ve gone to other countries and given workshops that have varied in length\\nfrom a couple of weeks to a couple of months. At one of them I met a man in Venezuela, and he\\ndecided he had had enough of the politics in Venezuela and he moved to America and he lives\\njust north of Stillwater and is a very good potter. His name is Guillermo Cuellar. I think you,\\nperhaps, have met him? He’s a wonderful potter. He’s a key person in this St. Croix Pottery\\nTour. Now, do you have any questions that I haven’t covered? I’ve been talking nonstop.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n6\\n00:26:50\\nAW: I do have some follow-up questions. When you moved to St. Paul that was right after you\\nfinished at the Art Institute of Chicago? Is that right?\\nWM: That’s right. We had been in Chicago and we had tried to make pots in Chicago but we\\nneeded a small job—and we were attracted by the Walker Art Center. It’s ironic that the Walker\\nArt Center at the time that we were looking for a job, they were very interested in utilitarian\\nobjects as artwork. In fact they had a whole section in a publication called The Everyday Art\\nQuarterly and the Everyday Art section of the museum. We, in looking for a place to work,\\ncontacted three or four places similar to that. They were the only ones who responded to our\\ninquiry and asked us to come up and we did. They said, “We have closed our school and don’t\\nhave a school but we’ll find you a job.” So they found us a job at another little art school in St.\\nPaul so that’s what brought us to St. Paul in the first place.\\nAW: What was the name of that art school?\\nWM: I won’t get sued for libel? It was the St. Paul Gallery and School of Art on Summit\\nAvenue. It was in an old mansion, which had been an art school for some time. We lived in the\\ncarriage house behind it. We were able to build a studio to teach ceramics.\\nAW: What were the schools like then in the Twin Cities? How many offered ceramics programs?\\nWM: There were no schools that we knew of that offered ceramics or that really concentrated on\\ncrafts. There were painting schools around and through the colleges and all but not concentrating\\non the crafts, except for the Walker Art Center, which at that time was very much interested in\\ncrafts and brought us up. But now the Walker Art Center has changed its direction and they’re no\\nlonger interested in anything that looks like crafts. Unfortunately we’ve lost a major museum for\\nsupport. On the other hand, the Minneapolis Art Institute has increased their interest in the crafts\\nand they’ve got a lot of craftwork is shown in their museum.\\nAW: Are there other organizations that support the crafts communities in the Twin Cities?\\nWM: I must say that I lived a very isolated life. I taught at the University and I worked here and I\\ndidn’t know a lot of the other things that were happening around here. I can’t say that I was very\\ninvolved.\\nAW: You said that you and Alix, your first wife, you were teaching and had started a studio but\\nyou said it didn’t work out very well. Was that in part the audience here? What was it like to sell\\nyour pottery here in the Twin Cities? This would have been--?\\n00:31:30\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n7\\nWM: We had great support from the Walker Art Center. We had a major exhibition over at the\\nArt Center, and that did us proud. We were very lucky with that. I can’t tell you all the history of\\nthis because it’s not relevant, but the director of the Art Center was let go and the new director\\nwasn’t interested in craftwork at all. Then I concentrated on the University.\\nAW: When you started selling your own pottery, would you also have shows for the general\\npublic?\\nWM: We sold any way we could. (Laughs). In fact, when we first came to St. Paul we found\\nnobody was very much interested in crafts except the Walker Art Center. We did everything to\\nbring people to our studio. We would encourage groups like the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, that\\nsort of thing, to come and we would give demonstrations and lectures to them. We had an open\\nhouse every weekend on Saturday where the studio was open to anyone who wanted to wander\\nin. Through the school, which we happened to work with—they had the Winter Carnival and the\\nschool where we were working was asked if they would design various windows for various\\nstores in order to attract people’s attention. We were working on that and in one of the stores—\\nI’ll never forget—my wife was making pots in the store window. It didn’t say anything about the\\nWinter Carnival but it attracted people’s attention to the store and that was all the store cared\\nabout.\\nAW: What store was that?\\nWM: It wasn’t the biggest one, it wasn’t Dayton’s—in fact, Dayton’s didn’t have a store in St.\\nPaul at that time. What was the name of it? I can’t remember.\\nAW: What time was this? When did you graduate from the Art Institute of Chicago?\\nWM: I came back from the army in 1946 and I graduated about 1948 and that’s when we\\napproached the Walker for a job and we were brought up.\\n00:35:00\\nAW: And you were in St. Paul for how long before you went to England to visit Leach and his\\nstudio?\\nWM: About 1950.\\nAW: At that time, what was the general public’s idea of pottery? What had they been exposed\\nto? How did they view pottery?\\nWM: An example: the Walker Art Center—they were not a craft museum but they had one\\npermanent exhibition, which showed how pots were made. They had examples from all over the\\nworld and that was a permanent exhibition showing how pots were made. We got into it because\\nthey had a shop that sold things and so they sold our pots at their shop. It worked out well. We\\ndid get some exhibitions at galleries around town, but to tell you the truth, I can’t remember the\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n8\\nnames of them. There was one in St. Paul. The guy was a painter and he ran a gallery and he\\ngave us an exhibition. Then there was one over in Minneapolis—it’s still going, the Groveland\\nGallery. We showed there once.\\nAW: How did the community in the Twin Cities compare to the arts community in Chicago?\\nWhen you first moved, what were some of your first impressions of the area?\\nWM: The Twin Cities was much less interested in art. The Chicago Art Institute is a very\\nwonderful museum and they had—at that time and still do—a broad selection of work. We were\\nlucky, also: in our schooling studying to be a painter, we had a marvelous art history teacher. She\\nwas so opinionated because she wanted to encourage experimentation and all that sort of thing.\\nShe was teaching art history—I’ll never forget—in a big auditorium and she had slides she put\\non various things she wanted to talk about. If a slide was up, it might be part of what she was\\nmoving toward but if it wasn’t something she liked she’d just leave it on for a second and then\\nsay, “Next slide please.” She wouldn’t say anything about it. We had marvelous painting\\nteachers in the art school. There was a man named [Robert] von Neumann, a German painter. He\\nwas wonderful because he never let you know how he painted. He was a very conservative\\npainter, but he was the most wonderful teacher because he would come up and stand and look at\\nwhat you’re doing and say, “What are you trying to do?” If you didn’t have an answer he’d\\nsimply turn around and walk away. If you told him what you were trying to do then he was so\\nfull of knowledge and where you should look, “Have you thought about looking at this? And\\nthat?,” which was connected with what you were trying to do. He was concerned with advancing\\nyour career and your knowledge rather than putting forth his own ideas. He was a great teacher.\\nAW: Who was the art history teacher?\\nWM: Her name was Kathleen Blackshear. She was the assistant teacher who wrote a book—the\\nfirst art history teacher I had was Helen Gardner. She wrote a book about art history; it was a\\nvery popular book about the history of art. Kathleen was her assistant and when Helen retired she\\ntook over as the main instructor.\\n00:40:45\\nAW: What did you like about your teachers in Chicago?\\nWM: The ones that I got were not by design but by chance because you’re taking a certain level\\nof painting class and there were only three or four teachers teaching that and you were just\\nassigned someone. The first teacher I had there, he was wildly enthusiastic about painting. He\\nwould arrange all sorts of things to see where the students were going, and there were different\\nsorts of set-ups of a model or still lifes. He’d take us out painting in the streets for scenery out\\nthere. He was a wonderful teacher. I had a marvelous teacher who taught design. This man was a\\nreally crazy guy. He taught design in the broadest sense of the word and encouraged all sorts of\\nexperimentation, which I think is critical to a good teacher. I can’t remember his name. I wish I\\ncould.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n9\\nAW: What got you into painting? Why did you pursue painting in the beginning?\\nWM: From the time I was a young kid I was interested in art and my parents encouraged it. They\\ndidn’t send me to school for art or anything like that but they just let me draw on everything.\\nThrough them then I met people who were interested in art and teaching. They helped and helped\\nencourage me. So I thought, when I was about ten years old, I’m going to be the greatest artist in\\nthe world. But of course I never was. (Laughs)\\nAW: Well, you’ve done a lot in the world of ceramics. Before going to the Chicago Art Institute\\nwere there any mentors in your life or artists that influenced you?\\nWM: There were teachers in my school. My parents, I told you, whenever they were transferred\\nto another town they never would live in the city; they wanted to live in the suburbs. This\\nindirectly led to very good schools, most of the time. When we lived in Wilmette, the high\\nschool there was one of the outstanding high schools in the country. Not in Wilmette but the one\\nwe went to because it was a community high school. I had great teachers there. That’s where I\\nmet the man who encouraged my parents to let me go to art school. He said, “Come on, stop\\ndiscouraging him. He’ll probably starve but he’ll do something with art.” He knew my parents\\nwell and persuaded them to back me at least for that first year.\\n00:45:30\\nAW: Your dad was a traveling salesman, what did he sell?\\nWM: He worked for Crane Company, plumbing fixtures and heating.\\nAW: And you mother, what did she do?\\nWM: She was a mother. (Laughs)\\nAW: Did you have siblings?\\nWM: Yeah, there were five kids in the family; three of them have died by this time.\\nAW: Were they brothers or sisters?\\nWM: There were three boys and two girls. The girls were twin sisters.\\nAW: Did any of them go into art?\\nWM: No. My older brother, he became an electrical engineer. My younger brother didn’t do\\nanything until he got to the army and he became a helicopter repairman. My two sisters—one of\\nthem went into—there was a store in St. Paul called Field-Schlick and she came up to visit us\\nonce from where she was living with our parents. She liked it up here so well that she\\napproached Field-Schlick and she got a job there. I can’t remember what she did there but it was\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n10\\nkind of an administrative job in the business. The other one, she got married and had kids. Never\\ndid hold a job.\\nAW: What did your family think when you graduated from Chicago [Art Institute] and started a\\nstudio and moved to St. Paul? Did they think you’d make a go of it?\\nWM: No. In fact, when they heard that we had been accepted by Leach, it didn’t ring a bell at all.\\nThey were not involved in art at all. My dad, when he was working for Crane Company, he did\\ntake me to a big factory they have in Trenton, New Jersey—that was when we lived near\\nPhiladelphia. And that was fascinating because he got in to see everything. He was at the time in\\ncharge of analyzing problems in the ceramic section, like if a toilet bowl was returned because it\\nhad a flaw in it. He had to figure out how the flaw occurred. He took us down and showed my\\nbrother and I everything about the factory: where they were making bathtubs and toilets and\\nwashbasins and everything. No real connection with art—well there was, I guess. They had\\ndesigners for their bathtubs and everything. That didn’t interest us at the time.\\nAW: Just a few more questions about these early years when you were just getting started. So\\nyou met Alix in the ceramics class [at Art Institute of Chicago]. Were there many female\\nstudents in ceramics class at that time?\\n00:50:05\\nWM: Oh yeah. It was mostly females.\\nAW: Why do you think that was?\\nWM: I think the men were all egocentric and all thought they were going to make a great painter.\\n(Laughs). It was interesting. One of the best people working in the class—in terms of having a\\npersonal expression—was a Catholic nun who came in her habit—put a coat over it—but she\\nmade marvelous little sculptural things in clay and was well known for that. The rest of them\\nwere in it because perhaps they weren’t interested enough to be in painting.\\nAW: How has that changed over the years?\\nWM: I don’t know. Everywhere I taught from the St. Paul Gallery and School of Art through the\\nUniversity and everywhere else where I’ve gone as a temporary instructor or to give a workshop\\nor something like that, it is almost equally balanced with men and women. I don’t know why that\\nis. I do know—I hate to say this—but the men are the ones that push for the reputation. Maybe\\nthey do bigger pots or something like that, but there are more well known men ceramicists\\nworking today, I think, than women. I’m not absolutely positive of that. There have been some\\nfamous women too.\\nAW: I was curious to know more about that time and what it was like in those classes, if Alix\\nwas unique in her interest in ceramics. That was interesting that there were more women than\\nmen at that time.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n11\\nWM: Alix also was able to transfer her style of painting to ceramic decoration much easier than I\\nwas. I was pushing my painting classes and I got into—not abstract expressionism but abstract\\npainting, very abstract. It became really hard-edged geometry. I always used to say, “I’m a poor\\nman’s Mondrian,” (laughs) whereas as Alix was much more influenced in softer forms and more\\nirregular forms with the result that she could look at a pot and she could just pick it up and start\\ndrawing on it with a brush and improve the pot because she understood form and the form\\nrelationship of the pot to the surface decoration. When she died I was really in trouble because\\nI’m a terrible decorator. I’ve had to concentrate much more on the form of the pots I make than I\\ndo on the decoration of them.\\nAW: When you first started doing ceramics what was the style you were doing?\\n00:55:00\\nWM: We had no style. (Laughs). We were just doing utilitarian—we were influenced by Leach’s\\nstatement, “Pottery is a utilitarian art, and this is where people can enjoy it everyday.” We were\\nmaking functional work even before we were at the Leach pottery. Once we got there that was\\nessentially all that we did: cups, saucers, plates, vases, mugs, all sorts of things. I’ll tell you, and\\nthis is interesting, Bernard said we could come and work with him. We were the first two\\nAmericans who had apprenticed at the Leach pottery. He had had apprentices from all over the\\nworld but no Americans before us. They didn’t know what to expect but then they—you realize,\\nwe’d been teaching in St. Paul before we got there. We’d been trying to run our own little studio\\nand all, so they thought, Here are people, they’ve gone through a professional arts school, taken\\nceramics—they didn’t know bad the class was, of course—they’ve made their own pots for three\\nyears, and they’ve taught a couple of years before they came to the Leach pottery. They must\\nknow how to make pots. They picked some simple forms for us to make. The forms that were\\nmade in the Leach pottery were of two kinds: one was what they called the standardware which\\nwas wear which was illustrated in a catalogue which was duplicated item for item, sometimes\\nvarying in glazes and so on but it was something that was sold as inexpensively as possible. That\\nwas called Standard Wear and that was what we made. Bernard and some of the other potters,\\nbut not many, made individual pots. Bernard’s work was all individual at this time because he\\nhad plenty of potters to make the standardware.\\nWe were assigned pots to make. The first pots I was asked to make—oh, I have to describe.\\nEvery person who was a thrower in the pottery had a making list, which was made up for each\\nfiring. It depended upon what they had orders for, what pots they’d run out of and the ability of\\nthat person of what they could make. We were the newcomers and they were very kind to us.\\nThey fired their big kiln every three weeks and their big kiln held two thousand pots. We were\\nassigned—each of us, Alix and I—three groups of fifty pots each. I remember the ones I started\\nwith. I was assigned a half-pint beer mug, a small soup bowl and a small pitcher with a handle on\\nit. I said, “Ok,” I looked at the forms they had there and said, “I’ll do the mugs first.” They had a\\ndrawing of the mug with the shape it should be with dimensions on it: height and width and so\\non. They had a bisque-fired example of each one of the pieces and they knew the weight of clay\\nto make it. Ok, start on the mugs. I think I need about twelve ounces of clay to make a mug or\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n12\\nwhatever it as. Made up the clay and made it into balls. I watched what other people were doing\\nbecause we were not experienced in that way.\\nAnyway I sat down at the wheel. We had boards like this—which is where we got the idea to use\\nboards in our studio to carry things around on—and I made about three boards of mugs; maybe\\nten mugs on each board. And then I called one of the regular throwers over to tell me how good\\nthey were, or bad. Bill Marshall was the guy who had been assigned to check on my work. He\\nwent to the board of mugs and he said, “Well, this one is too tall,”—he had an eye—“This one is\\ntoo fat. This one is too rounded. This one is too swoopy this way. This one is too stiff. This one\\nhas a problem with the proportion of parts of it.” There was something wrong with every one of\\nthem. He’d just put his finger through them and wad them up and do them again. That was Alix’s\\nexperience too. Neither one of us had learned to throw and put clay where you want it when you\\nwant it. We’d been throwing and you make a bowl, well, Hey, that’s a bowl. Look! A wonderful\\nbowl. (Laughs). And here we were asked to make a specific form and we had to learn that. It\\ntook each of us about the same amount of time—it took us about three months—to really become\\na contributing potter in the studio. They didn’t scrap all our work but in the beginning it was all\\nand then they began to accept some of it as ok and so on, and it went on like that.\\n01:02:30\\nAW: Who were some of the other potters there at the time or other apprentices?\\nWM: There were no other apprentices when we there because they could only take two\\napprentices. Usually they only took one apprentice at a time. The fellows who were working\\nthere—and when we were working there, they were all guys, not women, although they had had\\nwomen working in the pottery at other times. These were kids who had gone to the local school\\nand discussing with the schoolteacher they selected a couple of guys to come to the pottery and\\ntry to make pots. They made a good selection because they were still there when we were there.\\nOne of them, Bill Marshall, he became the best thrower of large pots. He got a lot of attention for\\nthat because he was really good. Kenneth Quick, who was the other young guy, he was the best\\nthrower of small pots. He could just whip off the little pots we were making. He never had to\\nmeasure them; they always came out the right size. He was incredibly skilled on making small\\npots.\\nAW: I think you’ve talked about this before in other sources, but can you describe Leach’s style\\nor form of pottery? What were some of his influences?\\nWM: They had a simplicity but a complexity, if that makes sense. They were a simple bowl, but\\nthere was an exact way that that bowl was to be made. I would have to draw you pictures to talk\\nabout them. There was a bowl we made that was called a porringer; you eat your porridge out\\nof—it’s a cereal bowl. When we made it that bowl had to have a form like this it was cut in\\nsharply at the bottom. (Draws a form in the air) Also the top edge was tapered so it was rather\\nthin and came to a bit of a point, which I think was a wrong thing. I don’t like that sort of an\\nedge on a bowl because it chips too easily. It had that and it expanded to a certain size and it had\\nto be just that way. We gradually learned to make that, but the funny thing about it—I don’t\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n13\\nthink people ordinarily look at shape. The reason I say this is, the Leach pottery had this catalog\\nthat they published. There were a couple of pages in it with a photograph with each of the\\ndifferent standardwares that they made. We’d looked at that but we probably never paid much\\nattention to it because one time—this was in our second year that we were there—they decided\\nthey were going to whitewash the inside of the pottery. It was a stone building and the color was\\nmessy and all. We had to take everything in the building, take it off the shelves and all so we\\ncould whitewash the walls.\\nIn the glazing room there was a high shelf that ran around eight feet up—storage stuff. In that\\nglazing room we found all kinds of old pots, which had been used to store glaze experiments in.\\nThere was something wrong with the pots. They were made at the Leach pottery, but there was\\nsomething wrong with them because they couldn’t be sold—maybe they had a crack in them\\nfrom when they were fired—but they were fine for mixing up glazes in. We found this porringer,\\nthe same one we were making, but it was nothing like the pot we were making. Because over the\\nyears everyone’s considered idea of how that porringer should be shaped had gradually been\\nchanged by critical discussions. This old porringer we found—it wasn’t like this at all, it was like\\nthis. (Laughs) It had a soft shape. It had what I would say no articulation. There were no changes\\nof direction to give you contrasting forms; it was just a bowl. But over the years the studio had\\nchanged it because they said, “This can be improved, or we’ll do this or we’ll do this.” Still, at\\nthe time we were there—this is what was made, not this. (Gestures with hand) (Laughs). I guess\\nyou’d say the pottery was very strictly controlled but those strict controls were subject to\\nvariation over five, ten years. The pottery had been going since the 1920s when we were there so\\nit was quite an old pottery. I can’t really tell you what kind of pots Bernard—Bernard did favor a\\npot with articulation: that is, a line that moves and then changes the direction, either abruptly or\\nsubtlety or whatever, to give the eye something to play with when you’re looking at the pot—not\\nthat it made the pot work any better—it was just nicer to have around.\\n01:10:00\\nAW: What was it like being there at a big production studio? Did you gain any lessons or ideas\\nfor how to run your own studio?\\nWM: Yes we did. When we came back and started our own pottery here we patterned our kiln\\nafter the one at the Leach pottery. You’ve got to think ahead, though, before you do things like\\nthat. The kiln at the Leach pottery was three-chambers with round arches on it like that. When\\nthey were packed I was assigned to help Kenneth Quick—this guy who was the best thrower of\\nsmall pots—he was in charge of packing the kiln and I was assigned to help him. Kenneth would\\nsit inside and I’d pass him things or—because you have to go into the kiln to pack it—or I’d be\\nsitting inside and Kenneth would be passing me pots to pack in the kiln. When we built our own\\nkiln we made it a two-chamber kiln but each chamber fed into the next one. The only thing\\n(laughs) that I didn’t realize—if I’m the only one packing the kiln—and I did have to do most of\\nthe packing because Alix was involved with the kids—I had to keep going in and out of that kiln\\nand I made the mistake of making it—the top of the arch hit me right about there. I could not\\nstand up in the kiln. But I realized afterwards that we never stood up in the chamber when we\\nwere packing the one at the Leach kiln; we sat down on a stool and pots were passed to us.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n14\\nEventually I decided to tear that down and build a kiln which is—you know what a car kiln is?\\nThe whole bottom of the kiln pulls out on wheels and it’s packed out in the open and then you\\npush it in and it’s done. That’s what I have now.\\nAW: No more hitting your head on the kiln. (Laughs)\\nWM: (Laughs) It wasn’t so much hitting my head as my back at the end of the day was broken;\\nyou couldn’t stand up.\\nAW: You left Leach in 1953?\\nWM: We left in 1952. We started this place in 1953.\\nAW: What were you planning to make?\\nWM: We were going to make the same kind of things but not the same forms. We’d say, we\\nneed a soup bowl and we’d design a soup bowl. Same thing for\\nAW: How you would describe your style at that point?\\nWM: At that point it was very much influenced by what we did at the Leach pottery. It took me\\nat least two years to get out of the sense that the right form was the Leach form. It took Alix less\\ntime than that because her painting influenced her more. I couldn’t design pots that were made\\nout of a bunch of straight lines. Her painting allowed her to think of form, which went with the\\nclay.\\n01:15:00\\nAW: When you moved back here how did you get everything set up? How did you choose where\\nto live? You saw an ad for this place?\\nWM: We bought it. Actually we had to get a bank loan.\\nAW: Why did you choose to come back to St. Paul?\\nWM: We discussed this quite a long time. We could have gone anywhere when we came back.\\nWe had no connection to St. Paul that brought us back here. But Alix was born in Chicago and\\nlived all of her life there until we got married and then we came up here. I was born in Kansas\\nCity. We had been talking with Leach about forms and all so much, and we felt that our sense of\\nwhat we wanted to do went best in the Midwest. To this day, I have a much easier time selling\\npots in the Midwest than I do on the East Coast or the West Coast. Actually, we sold everything\\nhere right here on the grounds at first. Eventually we had to change that because we—I didn’t\\ntalk about that we had a big fire and burned down the barn. This was long after Alix had died.\\nOne of my kids—I had just come down to the barn to check on the kiln or the firing and\\neverything was going great and I adjusted it and I approached the house and one of my daughters\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n15\\nwas looking out the window and she said, “Dad, the barn’s on fire.” There was no chance—I\\ncouldn’t stop it. It was old dry wood and the kiln was in the lower section of the barn. I did learn\\nthat if you’re going to have a kiln in a building like that, then make that building flameproof. The\\nkiln room, which is beyond that wall, is completely concrete. The roof and floor, everything is\\nconcrete. Theoretically it can’t burn. (Laughs)\\nAW: Let’s hope not. (Laughs) So you were looking around and thought the Midwest was the\\nbest place. Why was that?\\nWM: I don’t know. We felt most at home here because we’d always lived [in the Midwest]—I’d\\nlived in Pennsylvania but that was a short time. If we’d gone elsewhere I’m sure I would be\\nmaking different kinds of pots.\\nAW: Can you explain that more? What was it about here that influenced your pottery?\\n01:19:30\\nWM: In other parts of the country the pots that I see that are selling most easily are pots that are\\nmade very exactly. At the Leach pottery, one thing I did learn was to relax a bit about form; it is\\nnot an exact form. That’s where my first teacher was really off the wall because she thought the\\ncloser the pots we were hand building were to industrial production—smooth, shiny, no\\nindentations, no bumps or anything—the better they were. It’s the bumps and indentations which\\nreally make a pot come alive.\\nAW: When you were getting your studio set up where did you get your clay from and your\\nmaterials from?\\nWM: We tried getting local clay but we couldn’t find any local clay around here that was\\nworking at the time. Although our land was very sandy and we did use a fine silica sand that we\\ngot by digging out of the land. But then we sent off to various clay companies that sold ball clay\\nand fire clay and etcetera and asked for samples of their clays and then we’d mix them up in\\nvarious quantities and finally we got a combination that we thought worked for us, and it was\\nbased on the one that we had worked with at the Leach pottery. Bernard didn’t want a clay that\\nwas too slick but he wanted a clay that was durable and could be formed to the forms that they\\nwanted to make.\\nAW: You were just saying that at Bernard’s you had learned to relax with form but it seems like\\nyou were supposed to stick with a certain form. Could you tell me more about your comment\\nthere?\\nWM: When Bernard encouraged us to make pots on our own, why, a different pot came out. I’ll\\nnever forget—since we lived with Bernard we got to know him very well. First of all we went\\nthere and we called him Mr. Leach and eventually we got to call him Bernard. Everyone else just\\ncalled him BL, so we were more casual. I was working in the studio one night and it was when\\nwe were encouraging the other kids in the studio to make pots of their own because we were\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n16\\ngoing to have a big firing and a sale. I was working there and I was struggling to make a plate\\nthat had some sense of character but that I could make and wanted to make. Bernard came into\\nthe studio and I was working here and he came in the door there and just stood looking at me and\\nmy struggles to make a plate and then he turned around and there was a big black board on a\\ndoor of the entry—and he turned around took out his chalk and he drew a beautiful plate on\\nthere. I shouted at him. I said, “Damnit all Bernard, let me make my mistakes. I don’t want to\\nmake your pot. I want to make my pot.” But he accepted that.\\n01:24:10\\nI’m still affected by Bernard but probably more so by his friend Hamada who is a Japanese\\npotter. Well, let me tell you, we’d have breakfast in the house, which is right next to the\\nworkshop. Bernard would finish his breakfast and inevitably he’d reach into his pocket and pull\\nout a scrap of paper and he had a little pencil about that long which he could barely hold and\\nhe’d sit down and he would start to draw pots that he wanted to make. And he drew beautifully,\\njust an expressive line that ranged from the softest little bit to a black—just with a pencil. And if\\nhe didn’t like the drawing he’d X it out and do another one. After breakfast he’d have a whole\\nbunch of paper and he would throw away the ones he didn’t like and the rest of them he’d put in\\nhis pocket and go off to the studio. He would make those pots that he had drawn. His friend\\nShoji Hamada never drew a pot before he made it. Bernard admitted to us that Hamada, when he\\nwas throwing—when they were both working together—Hamada, the closest he would come to a\\nplan was he would put slip on his wheel head—make it messy—and then he’d draw with his\\nfinger on it. But it was just an idea. Then he would solve the problems by making the pot.\\nBernard solved the problems in his drawing, and therefore his pots were much tighter because he\\nwas tracing the pots in his mind.\\nWhen we had them here for this workshop—we haven’t talked about that, but there was a big\\ninternational conference in England that Bernard organized for potters and another at the same\\ntime for weavers. Bernard was in charge of the potters, and he asked potters from all over the\\nworld and picked ones whose work he liked. He asked Hamada to come to the conference.\\nHamada came and also his friend Yanagi Soetsu who was a leader of the folk craft movement in\\nJapan—a good friend of Hamada’s also. They came together and they came by boat from Japan,\\nso it took them quite a while to come. They decided that when they went home they would not\\ngo back by the Suez Canal and India but they were going to keep going west and they were\\ngoing to cross the United States where Hamada had not been. Yanagi had been here; he had\\ntaught at Harvard at one time. He was not a craftsperson, he was a philosopher, really. They were\\ngoing to go home by way of United States. Bernard was also planning to go back to Japan with\\nthem. We were at this conference—we got invited because we were at the Leach pottery—but\\nanyway, Alix was standing with Hamada and Bernard when they were discussing this and they\\nsaid they were going to go west across the United States and visit potteries around. Alix said,\\n“Well, if you’re going to go across the United States would you be willing to do some workshops\\nat different locations?” Hamada thought for a while and he said, “Well, if you’ll arrange them,\\nwe’ll do them.” So she arranged four workshops for them, which was not the only places they\\nwent. The first one was at Black Mountain College in North Carolina and known as an\\nexperimental college and all, and they had a pottery class there. The second one, because we\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n17\\nwere here, was in St. Paul. The third one was at the Archie Bray Foundation in Montana. And the\\nfourth one was on the West Coast in California.\\nWe came back and we’d heard that they had arrived and they’d gone through North Carolina. It\\nwas a two-week workshop that they did. They spent a lot of time on these. In between they\\nzigzagged all over; they visited many more places than these four, but they spent two weeks in\\neach of these places. We were in charge of arranging the one here in St. Paul. We had gone back\\nand were still working in St. Paul in that awful little art center. I went to North Carolina to\\nobserve the one they did there. There Bernard and Hamada threw pots all day long and they\\ntalked and Hamada gave lectures on the folk craft movement. That was it. We decided that we\\nwanted to make some points with them, which were not just having them make pots. One of the\\nthings which had been bugging us since we’d left the Leach pottery was, how do other people do\\nthe same pot again and again and again and keep it fresh? We discussed this with Bernard and\\nHamada when they came to St. Paul and they said they’d be happy to do anything we wanted.\\nAlong the way we set up a project that was really addressing this duplication problem. We said,\\n“Ok, one of you will design a pot and sit down and make twelve of them. Then explain that pot\\nto the other one and that person will sit down and make twelve of them.” So it turned out that\\nHamada drew the short straw and he got to design the pot. It was a nice little slip bowl that came\\nup and had an edge on it and a turned foot. He made it and cut it off the wheel and put it down on\\nthe board. He sat there and stared at it for a minute; then he took another lump of clay and put it\\non the wheel and made another one. Then he cut it off and put it on the board and then he began\\nto laugh. I said, “Why are you laughing?” He said, “The second pot is always the worst pot.” He\\nsaid, “The first pot you’re creating something. The second pot you’re copying that; you’re\\ntracing it and you haven’t learned the form yet. If you do a hundred you should probably be able\\nto make one that’s better than the first one because you get into the rhythm of doing it. But the\\nsecond is always the worst.” We had settled in our mind anyway that he felt the same we did.\\n01:34:30\\nAW: What happened when Bernard made the same thing?\\nWM: Well that was the funny thing. Hamada’s was a low bowl like this. When Bernard made his\\nit became a much deeper bowl. He still had the turned out edge at the top and all but a much\\ntaller foot on it when it was turned. The answer was that Bernard had a rhythm of working with\\nform, which he couldn’t break. He was seventy some odd years at that time and he just could not\\nbreak it. Hamada had a rhythm too, but he wasn’t in the position of having to imitate Bernard’s\\npot.\\nAW: Who came to the workshops here in St. Paul?\\nWM: We had about two hundred people who attended the workshop. It was jammed. They came\\nfrom all over the country. In fact a bunch of people came from Montana where they were going\\nnext. They wanted to see how it worked out.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n18\\nAW: What were Bernard’s and Hamada’s perception of the area?\\nWM: We introduced them to as many people as we knew who would enjoy their philosophy and\\nall. Bernard had been here once before when he was on a lecture tour in the United States.\\nBecause we were teaching at the St. Paul Gallery, we got him to come and give this public\\nlecture and it was done in conjunction with the Walker Art Center. When he came for the lecture\\nwe were living in a little apartment and we didn’t have room to put him up. The St. Paul Gallery\\nwas on Summit Avenue—the fanciest place in town—and wealthy people who lived near\\nSummit came and took classes at the pottery. We got to know some of them very well. One\\nfamily that we did get to know was the Archer Daniels Midland family. Fannie Daniels took\\npottery with Alix and she was just hysterical and wonderful and so we asked her if they could put\\nBernard up. “A pleasure.” They had a monstrous house and servants and all and they put him up.\\nWhen Bernard and Hamada and Yanagi came, we couldn’t put all three of them on the Daniels\\nso we asked another person who we knew--also connected to the arts center just because she was\\na patron of it—if she could put up Hamada and Yanagi. She said, “Oh, of course, would love to.”\\nIt turned out they went there and this was 1952 so it was shortly after the Second World War and\\nin the Fitzgerald’s’ house, where Hamada and Yanagi was put up, their cook would not cook for\\nthem. Mrs. Fitzgerald, she just went into the kitchen and cooked. She was wonderful.\\nAW: That was not a great welcoming for them.\\nWM: I don’t think that they knew that this woman had refused to cook for them but we found out\\nbecause we were told later. So there were problems.\\nAW: Were there people from the Twin Cities who attended the workshop or were they from all\\nover Minnesota?\\nWM: Yeah, a number of people, but I think half of the workshop were from outside the Twin\\nCities.\\nAW: What was the impact of their visit, of their workshop, on the local potters community?\\n01:40:00\\nWM: I think there were a group of people who accepted what they said but felt like they had to\\ndo it themselves. And another group who rejected everything they said. I think there were both\\nkinds of things.\\nAW: Can you say more about the local potters communities? Who was here in the Fifties and\\nSixties? What were their approaches?\\nWM: Many of the people out of our classes attended and they were the most accepting. They got\\nthe most out of the workshop. A lot of people who came they came because they gave us money\\nto bring them here and the Art Center didn’t have any money. We solicited from wealthy people\\nand we just gave them an entry to the workshop free, of course.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n19\\nAW: When you moved back and settled here, were there other potters here at the time?\\nWM: There were a few. There was Martha Cutkomp who was the only potter here when we\\nmoved here first. She was still around. From the classes that had been taught we were getting\\npeople who were trying to set up potteries in various ways. This was sometime after we had first\\ncome up here. The schools around had developed programs and it was much better.\\nAW: When did you start teaching at the University?\\nWM: We came back in 1952 and I think I started there in 1953.\\nAW: When did you retire?\\nWM: Nineteen eighty-nine. I had married Nancy and we lived out here and so I was feeling, I\\nguess, taught out. I had been chairman of the department for a couple of years and I wanted to\\nget out of that. I said I was going to take a leave without pay—if you take a leave with pay, you\\nhave to come back to make that up after your leave is over. So I said to Nancy, who was working\\nat the University in the dean’s office, “I’m going to take a leave without pay; then if I find that it\\nworks out, then I don’t have to go back.” I was going to ask for a half-year or a year off. She\\nworked in the dean’s office and she said, “Ask for two years off. You’ll get it.” So I did and they\\ngave me two years off and I didn’t have to go back. I didn’t go back.\\nAW: Tell me about your time teaching at the University of Minnesota? What stands out to you?\\nWhen you started—they were changing the department around? What was that like?\\nWM: We were trying to build a ceramics department because that had been destroyed. The art\\ndepartment also had a weaving department—that was taught by a woman who was an incredible\\nweaver and she built that up from nothing. I don’t know what happened but the guy who was in\\ncharge of the whole art department, and he was the one who hired me—he was an art historian—\\nand he decided that the weaving belonged under home economics rather than art. He stressed art\\nhistory and painting and sculpture primarily but kept ceramics. We gradually built the ceramics\\ndepartment and we were able to get an instructor after a few years. We wanted someone different\\nthan me. We got a guy named Curt Hoard who came from Wisconsin, and he was more\\ninterested in sculptural things than he was in pots. We taught there together for a while. And\\nabout that time I retired.\\nAW: Who was the guy running the art department?\\nWM: The fellow who was given the authority to change it? Harvey Arneson. He was an art\\nhistorian himself but he was also an administrator; that’s why he had been selected to build up\\nthe art department.\\nAW: When you started teaching, what was your philosophy of teaching?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n20\\n01:47:00\\nWM: I hate to say this, but I really insisted that everyone make utilitarian pots. A few years later\\nwhen Hoard was hired I realized that I had been too dogmatic because he was a different\\napproach, much more sculptural, and so I began to do this and that and loosen up.\\nAW: Did any of your students become instructors as well?\\nWM: They did become instructors at other schools but not at the University. The University\\nseldom hires their own students as instructors.\\nAW: Was Mark Pharis one of your students?\\nWM: Yeah, he was one of my students. When I quit I sat in on the discussion—they did have a\\nsearch for the replacement. Mark was the best of anyone who came. Everybody in the art faculty\\nsat in on this interviewing that applied, and the painters were a real snotty group and they were\\nasking questions they thought would puzzle these poor potters. But Mark Pharis, when he was\\nasked questions, most of the questions the painters would ask—the potters, we didn’t ask any\\nquestions because we knew most of these people and what their abilities were—but the painters\\nwere always digging a bit. Mark Pharis was the only one who came and applied and sat in his\\ninterview and they’d ask him a question and he’d think about it for a long time and then he’d\\nrestate the question in a much broader way. They were asking for some little fact thing and he’d\\ntalk about it in a more philosophical way. He won them over.\\nAW: Sounds like he had a gift for being a teacher for bringing a specific thing into a broader\\ncontext.\\n01:50:10\\nWM: Mark turned out to be—it’s funny because when he was a student he was kind of a wiseass,\\nwise-cracking comments that really had no place in the classroom. When he was hired he\\nchanged completely. Shortly after he was hired he was elected chair of the department. There\\nwas a lot of infighting and he was the only person who nobody hated.\\nAW: Over your time at the University of Minnesota what was your role in bringing ceramics to\\nbe an important part of the art department?\\nWM: The ceramics department just grew. People liked it and all. They began to also exhibit\\noutside and so it got a reputation and that attracted more people to the university.\\nAW: I read somewhere that you were awarded a Regents Professor. Is that right?\\nWM: Yeah, but that has nothing to do with teaching art. It’s an honor, I know.\\nAW: Is there anything you miss about teaching at the University?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n21\\nWM: I miss the interaction with the people. Now that we’ve got the studio here and all, anytime\\na group of students or faculty member wants to bring a group of students I say, “Sure.” It takes\\ntime to break your own work and talk with them and demonstrate and all of that, but it’s\\nworthwhile.\\nAW: What role do you think you’ve played in shaping the potters community in Minnesota?\\nWM: It just grew. Ceramics is a wonderful thing and if you have a situation where people can\\ntake the course and have freedom and explore ideas, it will grow. It just worked that way.\\nAW: Why do you think people were able to do that on their own? What is it about Minnesota\\nthat has supported ceramics?\\nWM: I can’t say. I don’t think our students were any better than others. They were better than the\\nbad schools—there are bad schools still. They enjoyed pots. Their friends enjoyed pots. We used\\nto have class critiques in my classes—I don’t know what Curt did and the other instructors—\\nwe’d have a class critique and the people would be working—maybe they’d be working on a\\nproblem, maybe just working on an assigned problem, maybe they’re working on their own.\\nPeriodically we’d have a day off and we wouldn’t work. We’d just bring the work in and every\\nperson would have a chance to react to it. They really were very frank in discussing their work\\nback and forth. Some of them they liked it so much—that interchange—that when they\\ngraduated they insisted on starting up a group, which would do the same thing. It could be\\nstudents or people they knew. By that time there were a lot of potters around. They called it Pot\\non Spot. (Laughs). Eventually it kind of disintegrated because it was a potluck meal that went\\nwith the meeting and discussions and it became a cooking contest instead of pottery discussion.\\n(Laughs).\\nAW: Did you ever go to these events?\\nWM: Sure, always. (Laughs)\\nAW: What would you make to bring? (Laughs)\\nWM: I don’t remember. (Laughs)\\nAW: Another follow-up question. You mentioned Nancy. When did you meet Nancy?\\n01:56:30\\nWM: I met her when she was hired by the University. The Art Department in the University—a\\ndisjointed department and we never got things done on time. If forms had to be filled out they\\nwere always late going in. It was just a sloppy department. Finally the Dean of Liberal Arts said,\\n“You’ve got to hire an executive secretary. It’s up to you to pick it but you’re going to have\\nsomeone that makes sure that the department runs right.” Nancy applied and she was the best\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n22\\napplicant that came. I was on the committee that hired her. She came to the department and did\\norganize it and get it functioning in a reasonable way. She didn’t take over the work of the\\nchairman, but she did see that things were done and done correctly. She got us going so well that\\nthe dean hired her away from us. (Laughs). He had a bigger budget than we did; we couldn’t pay\\nher very much. She went to the dean’s office. I was getting very interested in her at that time but\\nit’s very nice that she went to the dean’s office because if she had been working under me as the\\nchair I wouldn’t have dared say a word to her.\\nAW: Nancy—did she have an art that she did?\\nWM: Yeah, she’s a fiber artist. She just had a big show at the White Bear Center for the Arts.\\nShe sells her stuff. She gets a lot more money for her stuff than I do for mine but it takes her a lot\\nlonger to make it too, so that’s understandable.\\nAW: How does it been for the two of you working together? Has she helped in the studio?\\nWM: She has tried decorating some art on pots. She doesn’t understand the three-dimensional\\nform; she’s used to working on a flat surface. We’ve tried it but it doesn’t work out.\\nAW: How about with shows?\\nWM: We’ve had a number of shows together.\\nAW: How have those gone?\\nWM: Those have gone well, wonderful, wonderful. Her stuff, generally speaking, was two-dimensional\\nand went on the walls and my stuff went on the flat surfaces.\\n02:00:00\\nAW: Have those shows been here or all around the country?\\nWM: All around the country. And in Japan, England, many, many places.\\nAW: Can we talk about your experiences traveling? What have those meant to you to go out and\\ndo workshops and demonstrations all over the world? Are there places or people who stick in\\nyour mind?\\nWM: You learn something everywhere you go, that’s for sure, is about all I can say. I kind of\\nenjoy it as long as it doesn’t get too much time away from the studio.\\nAW: Have there been any surprising moments or responses to your work?\\nWM: No.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n23\\nAW: To get to questions related to the Tour and the St. Croix River Valley. We’ve been talking\\nabout your background history, which has been really interesting. You moved here to Stillwater.\\nWhat were the St. Croix River Valley area boundaries at the time?\\nWM: When I started to teach at the University I began to know people who lived in this area.\\nThere was a painting instructor there—Roy Turner—and we became good friends. Also I began\\nto realize that some of my students—Randy Johnson—went down to teach in River Falls,\\nWisconsin. He’s just grown and grown and grown as a potter, a wonderful potter. He’s been a\\nguest—each one on the St. Croix Valley tour, each one who has a location can invite up to four\\nor six guests. Randy has been a guest even though he’s not in the St. Croix River Valley. That’s\\nwhat has kept it alive. Every year some new potters are showing and sometimes they’ll repeat for\\na couple of years and then they’ll drop off, or whatever—it depends on the people’s studios\\nthey’re at. I think there were something like eleven studios the last time I went. I didn’t like the\\nwork that I saw at everyone’s studio but somebody comes along and likes it.\\nAW: You mentioned earlier that early on you would invite people to show their work with you\\nand that might have been the start--?\\nWM: There it was people whose work that I liked.\\nAW: Who were the people you invited to show with you?\\nWM: Guillermo was one. Former students like Mark Pharis and Tim Crane and Mike Simon.\\nMike was the one who introduced me to Ron Meyers, who is from South Carolina, I think.\\nAW: How would you do the shows here?\\nWM: People would bring their stuff and we’d mow the grass down and throw the stuff—\\n02:05:00\\nAW: Who were the people who came to your shows?\\nWM: Just general public, mostly. We did get a mailing list together once and sent out postcards.\\nWhen we first started out we’d just take blank postcards from the post office and write, “Pots,\\npots, pots,” and send them off to people; give them the dates and that’s all we did. Then we got a\\nlittle fancier and had something printed, but it worked well.\\nAW: Why has the Tour developed so successfully?\\nWM: They get a lot of good publicity out and that’s something that we never did when we just\\nhad our friends showing our work here. We just were happy to sell pots. They do a lot of good\\npublicity and they have a wonderful variety of people that their work they’re showing, plus the\\nguests who come in—all of that has made it quite exciting. The idea of this pottery tour where\\nthe work is sold at people’s studios and the people can see the location and all that has been\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n24\\npicked up in a number of other places. One fellow who was a former student of mine moved up\\nto Duluth and he got involved in a tour up there and they call it Crossing Borders. They have\\nrepresentatives all along from Duluth all the way over to Grand Marais. Not just pottery, but all\\nsorts of arts. They get a big crowd who get in their car and drive up there. Wonderful.\\nAW: Have you come across any other tours like this in other parts of the country?\\nWM: There are some in other parts of the country. I think the idea has mushroomed. There are a\\nlot that I don’t know about.\\nAW: Do you think the St. Croix River Valley tour has played a role in encouraging other people\\nto do similar tours?\\nWM: I can’t say that. I know there are more and more, but maybe it’s something that is\\nspreading as a way to look at and sell arts and crafts.\\nAW: So you never officially participated in the Tour?\\nWM: No.\\nAW: But it seems like the first two or three years they have you listed as part of the Tour?\\nWM: They may have, but it would just be the people who would come here and see what I have.\\nThat’s all.\\nAW: Did you ever participate in any planning?\\nWM: No.\\nAW: Do you see that the Tour has changed the potters’ community in the area?\\nWM: Yeah. It’s grown and it’s much more interactive. It’s a real thing. It’s great.\\nAW: Grown more? Interactive? More potters now? Has it encouraged more people to pursue\\npottery?\\nWM: Yeah, more potters. And bringing in guests, that helps.\\nAW: Has it changed anything for you?\\n02:10:00\\nWM: (Shakes head no). We used to sell all our pots here at the studio or through exhibitions we\\nhad. I can’t remember when this happened, but it would be after I burned down the pottery and\\nwe built this and the building next door was a showroom. It was an honor showroom: that is,\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n25\\nthere was no way there to sell you pots; the pots all had prices on them and there was a basket\\nwhere you drop your money or a check and you wrapped your own pots and took them away.\\nUnfortunately this happened because there were a group of people—I know who they were.\\nThey were immigrant people and they didn’t have jobs and somehow they found out about this\\nshowroom. I had a sign in there, “Please limit your purchases to two pots per person per firing.\\nThere will always be another firing so you’ll get more chances.” Since it was an unattended\\nshowroom they found out that they could buy as many as they wanted and a couple of days later\\nthey were for sale on the internet—they weren’t buying them for themselves. We had to close the\\nshowroom.\\nThat’s forced me now—once in a while I sell some pots here, but most of my pots are sold\\nthrough the Northern Clay Center and other galleries around the country. But that means that\\nthese galleries have to mark the prices up and some of the galleries are almost as bad as the\\npeople who were buying too many and selling on the internet. They jack the prices way up. I\\nplead with them not to, but they know what their problems are and they say they have to do this.\\nAW: So you contacted them?\\nWM: Yeah.\\nAW: This is another questions we ask about the Tour: How has the Internet or other technology\\nchanged how you sell your work and how the public interacts with your work?\\nWM: It’s not the Tour that changed how I sell my work—it’s the fact that the showroom didn’t\\nwork anymore. It’s too bad. Northern Clay Center comes the closest to any of the galleries I\\nwork with to just using a nice normal markup. But even they suffer a bit.\\nAW: Has this affected other potters you know?\\nWM: Some of these galleries say, “I can’t sell your pots with a low markup because it will\\nundersell the other potters that I’m selling.” I think, Your job is to explain to them why I’m\\nmaking a type of pot that I can make very simply and rapidly and they’re making a different kind\\nof pot and it has to pay—they’re not getting rich on it, but they have to get paid for their time\\ntoo. That’s what I think the job of a gallery owner is—not to try and level out so everyone is\\nselling at the same price.\\nAW: What is the future for you and your work and selling it?\\nWM: I’m not going to make pots much longer. I’m ninety years old and I’m slowing down. I\\nknow my pots are not as good as they used to be but I still like to make them, so I’ll go on\\nmaking them as long as I can, but they won’t be much. That’s just the way it goes.\\nAW: Speaking back to your issues with some of the galleries—something like the Tour or the\\nshows that you used to have—that seems like an opportunity for artists to sell directly to people\\nwho want to buy their work. How important are those shows for potters?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n26\\n02:15:30\\nWM: If they’re like the Tour—the potters can set their own prices. The person who’s having\\ntheir studio used and inviting guests—he doesn’t tell the guests how to price their work. They\\ncan price it any way they want. That works closer to just selling it out of your own place.\\nAW: A few more questions here on the impact of the Tour. What do you think the impact of the\\nTour has been for the St. Croix River Valley area?\\nWM: I think it’s been great. It’s grown every year; more and more people are hearing about it\\nand more and more people are coming. I know the income of the potters has gone up\\nconsistently. Guillermo Cuellar—who’s a good friend of mine—he said this last year was the\\nbiggest year he’s ever had. He said that without checking about the other people but I’m sure\\nthey were all experiencing the same increase in sales.\\nAW: Why do you think it’s grown so much?\\nWM: I don’t know.\\nAW: You do know many of the people involved in the Tour. Can you say a few words about\\nsome of the people you know who are involved in the Tour? What was your relationship with\\nsome of the hosts?\\nWM: I didn’t know Bob Briscoe because he didn’t go to school near here. He went to school\\nsomewhere else and he moved here. I first saw his work at a gallery in town and I was really\\nexcited by it. Since then I’ve gotten to know him and know his work even better. I probably\\nknow most of them now, although a couple in the middle part of the Tour there that I don’t\\nknow. I can’t even remember their names. All the rest of them are friends.\\nAW: Were they students?\\nWM: Some of them, not all.\\nAW: Now Guillermo you met in Venezuela? What was it like when you met—it seemed like\\nthere was a great connection there? We talked with Guillermo as well and he really remembers\\nthe first time he met you and was learning about your work.\\nWM: I was doing a workshop and I was asked down to Caracas to give this workshop. I said, “I\\ndon’t speak Spanish.” And they said, “We’ll find you an interpreter.” I went down and we had\\nthis workshop for two weeks. The interpreter—who was a very nice guy—I don’t think he was a\\npotter but he was interpreting. I met Guillermo because he was taking the workshop—he was not\\nhired as an interpreter—but I found out quickly that he spoke very good English because he\\nmarried a woman from America and he’d been here going to school, also. He spoke very good\\nEnglish. I was saying something and this guy who was supposed to interpret—I said something\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n27\\npretty simple and this guy started to talk and he talked and he talked and he talked. I finally\\nturned to Guillermo and I said, “God, I didn’t think it took so much longer to say something in\\nSpanish as it does in English.” He said, “Well it doesn’t, but he’s kind of showing off and he’s\\nsaying it in,”—I don’t know what the versions are but one is the local vernacular and one is the\\nCastilian—“But secondly, he’s not saying what you said.” From then on Guillermo became my\\ninterpreter. So that’s how I got to know him and his pottery. Then they decided they couldn’t\\nstand Venezuela anymore so they moved up here. He worked with me for quite a while because\\nhe had no other place to work. Now he’s got a great pottery. He’s going a mile a minute. He’s a\\ngreat potter.\\n02:21:40\\nAW: What was it like to have him work with you? You said you’d had one apprentice--?\\nWM: Guillermo wasn’t an apprentice. He was a professional potter and I wasn’t responsible for\\nhim at all. He’s a great worker and he knows how to see things that need to be done or do them.\\nAW: Did you have many professional potters come work with you or was this unusual?\\nWM: No, except for these groups that would come for a week or so and we’d fire one kiln.\\nAW: What about some of the other members of the Tour? Richard Abnet—did you know him?\\nWM: He was a student of mine but he left the University and he went to graduate school\\nsomewhere else. I knew Rich.\\nAW: He moved into the area pretty early on as well. It seemed like the two of you were the only\\npotters here for a while?\\nWM: No, there were other potters around.\\nAW: Did you guys talk much or was there a strong sense of community then?\\nWM: There was, but primarily it came about through the commonality of the University\\nsituation.\\nAW: What is the sense of community now in the potters’ community? Is there a strong sense of\\ncommunity?\\nWM: I don’t think there is a center to it. I think it’s interesting that now the Minneapolis Art\\nInstitute has taken a greater interest in craftwork than they used to. The Walker, of course, has\\nmoved the opposite direction and moved away from crafts. There’s just a lot more activity. There\\nare galleries that show craftwork in town. The Northern Clay Center is just great because they\\nteach classes, they have studio space that they rent at a very modest amount, and they sell masses\\nof pots, masses of them. They’ve had a big effect.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n28\\nAW: And individual potters like yourself? Are you part of building the potters community?\\n02:25:00\\nWM: I sell through Northern Clay Center. That’s as much as I can say I’m part of the\\ncommunity. I know the potters. We all know one another.\\nAW: I’m asking this because we’ve talked to all the other members of the Tour and they all\\nmention you as someone they learned from or they admire your work or that you’ve taught them\\nsomething about pottery and how to do these shows. So, I’m asking you now looking back the\\nother way what your thoughts are on this community.\\nWM: We try to go on the Tour when we can, but we haven’t been able to now because of my\\nwife’s illness.\\nAW: To run though the other members of the Tour: Connee Mayeron?\\nWM: She was a student at the University.\\nAW: I was just looking back at her interview and she was talking about being in a class of yours.\\nShe apparently had a much different idea of pottery than you did?\\nWM: I don’t expect my students to all think like I do. (Laughs). That I’ve learned over the years.\\nThey’ve all got their own ideas. You’ve heard this, but someone asked Shoji Hamada how he\\nknew what a good pot was and he said, “The pots I like are good pots—for me.” Not that they\\nwere the only good pots, but he was the one who was making the decisions. He was telling\\neveryone, “You make the decision. If you like the pot it’s a good pot for you.”\\nAW: That’s a good way to approach it. You see this at the Tour the variety of potters means that\\nanybody going usually finds something that they like. Some other early members of the Tour\\nwere Will Swanson and Janel Jacobson?\\nWM: I don’t know Will. I don’t know where he came from or his training. I do know Janel\\nbecause she was a student at the University.\\nAW: Did you get to know Janel? She was in the area too.\\nWM: Yeah, sure. She did wonderful pots before she got into these netsuke that she does now.\\nShe did exquisite engraved porcelain—just marvelous.\\nAW: Did you ever do shows together or have much interaction?\\nWM: No. We’d visit her but I guess I’m more excited by her netsuke than I am by her porcelain\\nbecause her porcelain—because of the time she spent on it—had to cost so much that it ran out\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n29\\nof my range. Yet they were worth it. They were really beautifully made. Have you ever seen any\\nof those?\\nAW: Her pots? Yeah, we saw a few examples. She showed us mostly the netsuke that she’s\\nworking on.\\nWM: She used to take porcelain and she’d engrave these pictures of insects and things like that\\nand the detail was just fantastic. They’re beautifully fired. The only thing is that she’d spend so\\nmuch time on this little covered pot that she had to charge a lot of money for them just to get her\\ntime out. I often wondered, What in the world do you use a little covered pot like that for? The\\nclosest thing I know to it is there is a red ink which the Japanese use and they baste it into a small\\nlidded pot like that, and when they want to stamp their stamp on something they just touch it to\\nthe ink and just like that, but I don’t think she sells them for that. Maybe they just love to look at\\nthem and that’s reason enough.\\n02:30:25\\nAW: That’s really interesting too as we’ve been seeing people’s pottery is how there are some\\nsimilarities—particularly people who have studied with you or pursued functional pottery—but\\nalso to have Janel’s work and Connee’s work too as something different. Jeff Oestreich?\\nWM: Yeah, Jeff was a student.\\nAW: And he went on to practice at Leach’s studio?\\nWM: That’s right, he did. We used to own a beautiful pot of Jeff’s that he did early on. I don’t\\nknow what we did with it. I think we probably gave it to a museum somewhere because it was so\\nnice. Then he went to New Zealand—Jeff loves to travel—and he went to New Zealand and he\\nmet potters there and traveled around. He traveled to one town—I can’t remember the name of\\nthe town—but this town had been destroyed by a fire—completely destroyed—at a critical time.\\nIt was rebuilt at the time of Art Deco and all the houses and buildings have little Art Deco\\ndecorations on them and Jeff was so fascinated by that that it changed his pottery and he began to\\ndecorate in the same manner. Just walking into this town and seeing it. We were there and it was\\nan exciting town, but I wasn’t looking for anything to change my pottery.\\nAW: I remember him telling us about that too. He was even tracing some of his interest in Art\\nDeco back to growing up and I think his mother had some jewelry or something that had similar\\ndesigns.\\nAW: Getting back to your work—what has inspired you and your pottery?\\nWM: I’m most influenced by Korean pottery, which Leach introduced me to, and Hamada, also.\\nYou know the Japanese love Korean pottery too. They love it because of the casual attitude of\\nthe Korean potters, but they have realized that they can’t adopt this casual attitude and so what\\nthey have done is to bring Korean potters to Japan and establish them in different areas and they\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n30\\nbrought the Korean approach to Japan. But they didn’t try to copy of them. They brought the\\npotters in because that’s the way they feel about pottery.\\nAW: What is it about Korean pottery that you like?\\nWM: They’re never showing off, well, in the Korean pottery I like. There was one period of time\\nwhere they were doing a lot of inlaid stuff and I think that’s so much decoration. We have a\\nbunch of Korean pots in our house and they’re just superb. The pot that I like the most—well I\\ncan’t say I like the pot the most of all of our pots but it certainly affects me the most—is one\\nwhich was made by Korean potters but it was made in Japan because the Japanese brought these\\npotters into this one village. It was from that village—you can tell—but it doesn’t look like a\\nJapanese pot; it looks like a Korean pot.\\n02:35:38\\nAW: Why do you make what you make?\\nWM: I just like making pots, that’s all. (Laughs).\\nAW: You’ve been doing this now for how many years? Almost sixty years? Why do you\\ncontinue to make what you’re making?\\nWM: Because every time I sit down at the wheel I can make something that I’ve never made\\nbefore. I often do but I also repeat myself.\\nAW: Do you ever draw your pots before making them?\\nWM: Little sketches but not exact drawings, not like what Bernard did. I’ll do a sketch to set sort\\nof proportion and so on.\\nThe most I’ll do—I took from the Leach pottery, or, Alix and I took from the Leach pottery—the\\nidea of making a making list. It’s not that you need to make those pots—in fact I often deviate\\nfrom my making list—but it gets me going. I don’t have to come down in the morning and say,\\nWhat am I gonna to make? What am I gonna to make? I look at the list and I can pick any one of\\nthose things and I can start right into it. It saves time, but I’m not on this list like the Leach\\npottery was on the list. They were running a completely different sort of situation where they did\\ntake orders and so they had to fill the orders and we don’t do that.\\nAW: At various points did you take orders?\\nWM: When we started we did, but when my wife died I took that opportunity to cancel all the\\norders on the books and since then I’ve never taken orders. I make the pots and if they see them\\nand like them, they can buy them. But I’m not going for something that they’re imagining in\\ntheir head and it’s not the thing that I imagine.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n31\\nAW: You said you had to set a limit for what people could purchase in the showroom. Why was\\nthat?\\nWM: Our pots were always cheap. I keep them as cheap as I possibly can. By selling them in the\\nshowroom we’re selling them at wholesale price, you see, and people would take advantage of\\nthat and just buy a whole bunch of things. It just didn’t work out because they were buying not to\\nuse, but to sell. But a gallery does the same thing.\\nAW: Why do you think your pottery has been so popular?\\nWM: It was cheap. Some people don’t like my pots at all. It’s not popular that way.\\nAW: Why is there such a demand for them?\\nWM: I don’t know.\\nAW: Have you ever heard from people who have bought them and they’re using them?\\nWM: I hear people, they say, “I have my coffee out of a mug of yours and I love it.” They might\\njust as well love someone else’s mug too. (Laughs)\\n02:40:20\\nAW: I think you’re being very modest. (Laughs)\\nWM: Like Hamada said, “The pot you like is the pot for you, a good pot for you.”\\nAW: A couple of reflection questions. What has pottery meant in your life?\\nWM: It’s the one thing that I started to do and I still love doing it. I used to be a painter and I\\nloved to paint when I was painting, but I don’t miss painting at all now. The idea of firing—the\\nway we learned at the Leach pottery, which is we fire under reduction. Do you know what that\\nis? When you have a fuel-burning kiln, when you short the fuel of air it produces smoky flame\\nand then that smoke, that hot smoke, is trying to combine with oxygen from anywhere it can get\\nit, and it takes the oxygen out of the chemicals on your pot. The opposite of that is an oxidation\\nfire where you have adequate air, oxygen, and you keep the chemicals in their oxidized form. My\\nglazes are designed for reduction firing. Because reduction firing is not a finite thing I can get all\\nsorts of surprises out of a kiln. You look at it and you see it’s reducing and you say, It’s fine, and\\nalong comes a draft of air and sucks more air up the chimney and therefore sucks it in around the\\nburner and you get an oxidation and it will change everything.\\nThe last firing, before the one I’m working on now, I had a bad firing and I don’t know to this\\nday what caused it. Somehow my kiln was leaking air and instead of the pots coming out with\\nthe richness they should have, they came out—in one section of the kiln—they were all oxidized\\nand they were all a little bit under fired, and they were all just deadly dull. (Laughs). I’m trying\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n32\\nto re-fire some of them, whether or not I’m successful? I don’t know. I’d probably be better off\\njust throwing them away and making new pots.\\nAW: So it is the element of surprise that keeps you interested in doing this?\\nWM: That’s right. My kiln that I use for the first firing for the pots—for bisque firing—is a\\ncommercial electric kiln. It has electric elements in it and they heat it up, but there’s air coming\\nin from any place it wants to come and there’s no smoke or anything. It always fires oxidized. I\\ngot in the habit of taking and making a special group of pots to fill the electric kiln and I use two\\nglazes on them. One is a copper green and the reason I use it in the electric kiln is that if I used it\\nin my reduction kiln it would turn an ugly liver color. I love the green. The other is an amber tan,\\ntransparent and kind of shiny. Those two glazes need oxidation so I fire them in the electric kiln.\\nBut when I open the lid to my electric kiln, it’s boring. Every green pot is the same green all the\\nway through the firing. Every amber pot is the same amber. That’s not right. You want to make\\npots to be excited by them.\\n02:45:50\\nAW: When have you been most excited about the pots you’ve made?\\nWM: I can’t say because I’ve had great firings and I’ve had terrible firings but I’ve forgotten\\nthem.\\nAW: When you’re not doing pottery, what are you doing? Any hobbies or interests?\\nWM: No. I read a lot. (Laughs).\\nAW: Are you still traveling a lot?\\nWM: Not since my wife got sick.\\nAW: What has it meant to you to be in this place? You’ve been in this place for sixty years. Why\\nhere?\\nWM: I love it. We got it just by chance. It was available and cheap. It’s neat. Of course it was\\nnothing like this when we bought it. The house was a dumb little house that was straight up and\\nhad too many windows in it and it had all sorts of things were wrong with it. This was a big barn\\nfor cows down here.\\nAW: The original barn burned. Right? This has changed a lot.\\nWM: Yeah, this has changed completely down here. The house has changed a lot too. When I\\nmarried Nancy she said, “Some changes got to be made in this house.” It didn’t have a very good\\nkitchen and a lot of things were wrong with it. I was just too lazy to work on it without the input\\nthat she had.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n33\\nAW: When did you guys get married and when did she move in?\\nWM: Nineteen eighty-nine. Not too long ago. No, before ’89. My wife would tell you exactly.\\nAW: I asked because after your wife [Alix] passed, were you raising your children on your own?\\nWM: I was.\\nAW: What was that like to balance pottery and being a father?\\nWM: Very difficult.\\nAW: Were there other single fathers that you knew of in the arts community?\\nWM: No.\\nAW: Did your children go on to pursue art?\\nWM: One of them lives in Minneapolis and one lives in Vermont. The one in Vermont is a writer\\nand having some success. The one in Minneapolis doesn’t know what she wants to do and she’s\\nnow over fifty years old, so I don’t know if she’ll ever find out what she wants to do.\\nAW: What are their names?\\nWM: Tamsyn, T-a-m-s-y-n, and Shawn, S-h-a-w-n.\\n02:50:00\\nAW: Tamsyn, that’s a really interesting name. Where is that from?\\nWM: When we knew we were expecting a child we were fascinated with Cornish names from\\nliving in St. Ives. We wrote to a friend there and we said, “Send us a bunch of old Cornish\\nnames.” We got a letter a few days later that had all these boys’ names and girls’ names and all.\\nHe had a little note on it that said, “The only place that I could find old Cornish names was in the\\ngraveyard.” (Laughs).\\nAW: Is Tamsyn, is she the one that moved?\\nWM: She lives here. Shawn moved to Vermont. She went to school in Vermont and she liked it\\nso much she decided to stay there.\\nAW: Did they ever try pottery?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n34\\nWM: They used to play. Yeah, they did try. In fact I got in trouble with one of my classes one\\ntime because Tamsyn wanted to learn to throw on a wheel. I had to kick the wheel for her and\\nshe threw the pot. She made a couple little simple cups, but they were ok. I took one of them to\\nschool and I showed them to my class. I said, “Look, a five-year old girl made this and if you\\ncan’t do better you’re going to fail the course.” (Laughs). That didn’t make people very happy.\\n(Laughs).\\nAW: Did they attend schools in the area?\\nWM: Yeah.\\nAW: What about the neighbors? Have you had the same neighbors?\\nWM: When I first moved here there were no neighbors. The nearest neighbor was half a mile\\naway.\\nAW: So when we took a turn on 68th there were no neighbors. Now there seemed a half dozen?\\nWM: Yeah, and bigger and bigger houses. They were all farmers, the few that were here.\\nAW: How has this area changed over the years?\\nWM: Our house has changed because we changed it, but the property hasn’t changed much—our\\nproperty hasn’t changed. Other properties have changed because what used to be a farmer’s\\nfields or a dairy farm is now a couple of houses. That’s all happened in the past six years.\\nAW: Is there something unique about the potters’ community here compared to other places in\\nthe country?\\nWM: No, I don’t think so. Potters tend to get together.\\nAW: Differently than maybe in other arts communities?\\nWM: Sure, yeah.\\nAW: Why do potters tend to get together?\\nWM: I don’t know, (laughs) because there’s so many things that you don’t understand. Every\\ntime I see someone else’s work I have to start all over and I have to look at it the way they\\nlooked at it.\\nAW: Do you feel that potters share with each other?\\nWM: Generally they do. There are a few that are secretive, but in America it is much more likely\\nthat the potters will share. The only one I heard was some guy—he was a potter in California and\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n35\\nhe was striving to make a particular Chinese glaze of a certain color. He got it finally and he\\nwouldn’t give anyone the formula for it. He would sell you a five-gallon bucket of the glaze, but\\nhe wanted a fortune for it. He was a nut.\\n02:55:35\\nAW: Is it uncommon for people to not share?\\nWM: I think it is. All the potters I know, they share anything they are doing with anyone else;\\nthere’s no secrets. I used to tell my students sometimes when some of them, if they were doing\\nglaze experiments they get a little iffy about it, I’d say, “Have you ever heard a painter say, ‘I\\nhave a particular blue and if I gave you the formula for that blue you’ll be as good a painter as I\\nam?’”\\nAW: What are your hopes for the future of pottery in Minnesota?\\nWM I hope it continues to grow and people are more and more interested in having handmade\\nwork or having it in their home. The ones that are irritating are the ones who buy it and never\\ntouch it because it’s handmade. That’s silly.\\nAW: Why is it so important to have that connection with functional pottery? Why do you want\\npeople to have the pottery in their hands?\\nWM: To use it. It’s only by using it that you really understand it, you know? I’ll tell you one last\\nanecdote. When we had Hamada and Leach for this workshop here my wife also said to Hamada,\\n“Since you’re going to do a workshop could we have a show of your work here?” Hamada\\nthought for a while—and he was in England at that time—and finally he said, “I’ll call my son\\nand have him select a small show and send it to you.” And so he did. I think his son sent about a\\nhundred pots along, a wonderful variety of things. There were so many people at this workshop\\nthat we had to draw straws as to what order people—if they wanted to buy—could make a\\nselection and then they could buy one pot or one unit. They said that was ok. Hamada—when the\\npots were on the way—he asked me if I would sit down with him and tell him about pricing\\nbecause he didn’t want to overshoot the American market. In Japan, pots are very expensive. But\\nhere they’re more expensive than mine but they’re not as expensive as in Japan.\\nSo he had a bill of lading and a description of the pots and he would describe the pot and I’d say,\\n“Well, if I were making it, it would be ten dollars. But here’s a really important potter so the\\nleast we can do is multiply that by five, so instead of selling it for ten dollars it will sell for fifty.”\\nHamada never questioned. He just wrote down whatever I said and that was the price that went\\non those pots. I told the gallery where we were showing this, I said, “Because he has not argued\\nabout these prices, you’ve got to not take any money for selling it. You can’t mark it up.” They\\nagreed to that. There were more people who wanted pots than there were pots. The only way to\\ndo it was to have a lottery. We put the numbers from one to a hundred on pieces of paper and put\\nthem into a hat; everybody can pull their number. My wife, who had gotten the show here, she\\nstill didn’t take advantage. She drew number two. That was just chance, but she did. I drew\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. MacKenzie\\n07/18/14\\n36\\nnumber ninety-four or something like that. When number two was called we went in. We didn’t\\nhave much money but with her number two we picked a set of six small plates. When I tell you\\nthese were inexpensive these six small plates only cost us thirty-five dollars; that’s what we\\npicked, they’re lovely. We have them and we use them all the time.\\nAnyway we were watching other people and we’d say, “If no one picks that one when ninety-four\\nis called, we’ll pick that one.” But of course it would disappear. Finally they called ninety-four\\nand we went in. By that time they were calling two numbers at a time because it was taking\\nso long for people to make up their minds. We saw one pot that was tempting but we thought,\\nWe’ll pick that and carry it around and see if we find something better. We looked and looked\\nand we didn’t find anything better. Only after we took it to the secretary and recorded our\\npurchase did Yanagi, the head of the Japanese folk craft movement, and a good friend of\\nHamada’s who knew his work—he had been watching all of this—he came up to us and he said,\\n“You just bought the best pot in the whole show.” We thought, He’s being nice. No, I don’t think\\nthere’s a best pot. There are better pots. But it depends on the individual and what you think the\\nbest pot is. That pot, which we hesitated to buy, it has grown on me since we bought it.\\nWhen I used to teach, I’d take pots out of our collection to school and show students so we could\\ntalk about them. Nobody ever reacted to that pot the first time they saw it, but many people—\\nafter thinking about it awhile—they’d say, When are you going to bring that brown Hamada pot\\nback? Because they wanted to see it again. It grows on you slowly. It grew on us slowly too. We\\nused to use it in the house when the kids were little. We’d fill it with peanuts and raisins and it\\nwas kept on the coffee table so kids could get food out. (Laughs). I still call it a dumb pot. It’s\\nnot a difficult pot to make. It’s not an elaborate form. It doesn’t have a beautiful glaze on it. It’s\\njust a pot, but it affects people. So maybe Yanagi was right. Maybe it was the best pot in the\\nshow. (Laughs).\\nAW: Or the best pot, as Hamada said--\\nWM: For me. (Laughs).\\nAW: Thank you for doing this interview. Anything else you want to add?\\nWM: I’ve talked too much.

This interview is for the “A\\nMeasure of the Earth: An Oral History of the Potters of the St. Croix River Valley,” made\\npossible by the Minnesota Historical and Cultural Heritage Grants. Also present during this\\ninterview is Tierney McNabb, project assistant. Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed and\\nlet’s get started.\\nCould you tell us about your name? You were starting to describe the meaning of your name.\\nJO: In this country it’s an uncommon name; it’s a German name. It translates as “Austria.” And\\nO-e-s-t is “east” and then r-e-i-c-h is “reich” or “kingdom.” And the eastern reich, or kingdom,\\nof Germany was Austria, so it means “Austria.” When I was in Germany I looked up our name in\\nthe phonebook—pages, and pages, and pages; it’s very common. In this country it’s more\\nobscure. Although we lived next door to another Oestreich family, we were not related. And my\\nsister had a car accident on the highway, and the other person—the other car—was a Nancy\\nOestreich too and they both had the same insurance company and they got the claims goofed up.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n2\\nAnd there’s three Jeffrey Oestreichs at my clinic, where I go for my injections and stuff. So,\\nthey’re not related. It’s a name that we all cursed as kids, but now I appreciate it. (Laughs)\\nAW: (Laughs) Well, you were saying that you’ve been thinking about changing it. Tell us more\\nabout that.\\nJO: I’m thinking of changing the pronunciation to “O-strike,” because of the difficulty of people\\nfinding me on the internet. And I did have one uncle that did pronounce it “O-strike,” that’s an\\nexception. So I’m in transition, pronouncing it both ways. I may at some point dump the “A-strike”\\nand go with the “O-strike.” But it originally had an umlaut over the “o” which we can’t\\npronounce, the “o” with an umlaut, it’s more of “uuoh”—(whispers) no can’t do that—\\nAW: “A-strike” is the correct pronunciation?\\nJO: How we do it. And do you know why that happened? Because when the record-keepers at\\nEllis Island or wherever, when all these foreigners would come through they would just spell out\\ntheir names phonetically, and so the names got altered, which makes it very difficult if you’re\\ndoing genealogy, which I’m just obsessed with family history. So it makes it hard when you\\njump overseas to connect up again on the trail.\\nNow if I talk too much, you tell me to be quiet—because I have a habit—\\nAW: No, this is great. Tell us about your family history. You said you were following the\\nmigration—?\\nJO: Yes, on my father’s side, his great-grandfather immigrated in the late 1800s and they settled\\nin Duluth. From there they moved more to the Iron Range to Coleraine and Bovey. That’s where\\nmy aunts and uncle lived and my cousins are still on the Iron Range. I still spend a lot of time up\\nthere; we have a family cabin. On my mother’s side they emigrated from Sweden through the\\nGreat Lakes—they settled in Rockford, just shortly. And then they went to rural Iowa and they\\nwere one of the first three settlers in that region in 1881/1882.\\nAW: Which region of Iowa?\\nJO: Laurens, it’s in Pocahontas County. Before my mom passed away I wanted to know more\\nabout her background. She didn’t really talk much about her background and so I spent two\\nmonths doing research and ordered documents and it was just a wonderful trip. I got in the car\\nand I went to every house that my mom lived in—except for her sorority house. I was all over\\nthe place going to these houses. I made prior appointments, but street names have changed in the\\nlast hundred years so I had to call up people and, “What’s the current street name?” I’d then\\ncontact them and bring little gifts. My great-great-grandfather who emigrated from Sweden, we\\nfound his house through the Pocahontas Courthouse; they had a team of people who helped. And\\nwe went out and the house is still standing that my great-great-grandfather built in 1881. I sat in\\nthe kitchen of that house and it was just awesome. When you trace your family’s history—and of\\nmy siblings there’s six children—I’m the only one who’s interested in family history. I have all\\nthese documents and files of things and I have all the old family Bibles and autograph books\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n3\\nfrom way back, and so I’m the historian in the family. I love it! Because all my sibs have\\nchildren and grandchildren—their meaning comes through looking at them and projecting.\\nMine’s going back because I don’t have children. So I go back and I can create this script out of\\nall these documents and books and things and create this script of their lives. So, my parents left,\\nthey met at the University of Minnesota in the middle thirties. My mom was studying piano and\\nmy dad was studying business and they fell in love and were married in 1940 in my\\ngrandmother’s house in Sioux Falls. I’ve been in that house a number of times over the years--\\nlast four or five years. I have a reel of their wedding from 1940. It was sixteen millimeter, and\\nthere’s my mom as a young woman and my dad as a twenty-one—\\nAW: Wow. Who had the video camera?\\n00:06:22\\nJO: My grandmother was a photographer. And it’s in color—color first came out in 1940. So I\\nhad it made into videotape—a CD—and watched it.\\nAW: So you had it converted to a CD?\\nJO: I converted it. And of course all the people in there, no one’s alive. But it’s still, to be sitting\\non that steps where they were when they were married in 1940—it’s brought enormous meaning\\nand comfort.\\nOn an aside, I remember in 1958, when we were going to stay with my grandmother, she had a\\nKitchen Aid mixer and as a kid I just loved it. It was passed down to mom and now I have it. It\\nwas made in 1947 and I use it nearly every day. It still just hums along and it’s using my\\ngrandmother’s objects that I have a lot of. It connects me with my mother and my grandmother\\nand my ancestors. That’s my mom’s jewelry right there—(refers to jewelry on table).\\nAW: Oh I see, these pieces.\\nJO: This is interesting—my mom’s jewelry box—I just kinda swiped it. I found out in my\\nresearch that my grandfather was a doctor and he delivered my mom. The delivery went bad and\\nmy grandmother died in the process. And so I found this (refers to locket)—this is my\\ngrandmother who died at twenty-three. I got this and it was all banged up in the back and I think\\nwhat happened was that when she died and my mother was a little kid they gave her this locket\\nto carry with her—she was an only child—and she must’ve had it in her pocket and it’s so worn.\\nThat’s the only reason why I think it’s so banged up is she treasured that.\\nAW: What was your grandmother’s name?\\nJO: Blanche Bowen.\\nAW: And these other pieces here?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n4\\nJO: Those are my mom’s things that she got in Mexico when I was fifteen and I always loved\\nthem as a kid. And this all fits into my love of objects—and Art Deco. Those are Art Deco\\ninspired pieces. And that fits into what I’m currently in love with and what I look at for source\\nmaterial. (points to objects on table).\\nAW: On the topic of the Kitchen Aid, what were some of the things that your mom made with it?\\nAre there family recipes that you have?\\nJO: I have some of those, and mom used to always make the Christmas bread in the—Krumkake,\\nit’s a Swedish bread with candied fruit in it. And she’d make a loaf for each of her six kids, but\\nshe’d always give me two loaves. I was her favorite. (Laughs) I was born two and a half months\\nearly and so she was always very protective of me and I was a momma’s boy and hung on to her\\nand just adored my mom.\\nAW: You said your grandparent’s house was in Sweden, the house your grandfather built—can\\nyou describe it? You said you were sitting in the kitchen? Tell us more about that moment.\\nJO: When we found the house and it was still standing the people at the courthouse were, you\\nknow, crosschecking, and they said, “Yeah, it’s still there.” So we got in the car and we found it.\\nMom was raised in Laurens—when I decided to go to Laurens for the first time to get—I wanted\\nto just find out more information. So, I called their genealogist society and this woman said,\\n“Okay, we’ll do some research, we’ll get back to you.” And so the woman calls me up a month\\nor so later: “We’re related.” I said, “Really?” “By marriage.” So she did all the research in the\\nMethodist Church and then she went with me to Pocahontas Courthouse in the neighboring town.\\nWe found out where the house was and we were driving towards this house and she says, “You\\nknow, I have a friend I hike with every day that’s kind of in this area, so there’s their house—.”\\nAnd we pulled in and there was a house and I said, “Wow.”\\nA friend of mine’s dating a guy from near that town—who grew up in that town—so he came for\\ndinner last week. I had some old photographs of this town. I said, “Joe, tell me now, I’ll feed you\\nif you recognize some things on here, the courthouse, this, and the other thing.” And he said,\\n(gasp)—and that was my great grandfather’s house there, that he built—and he says, “I’ve been\\nin that house, we had a farm right near there. And that’s Doug, he was my high school friend.”\\nHe knew my relative by marriage, who’s eighty years old that did a lot of the research, and\\n“Well, I know her.” So it’s just wonderful. To me in life, what I love more than anything is\\nconnecting—making these connections with people and events and tying them all together.\\nThat’s my gift and it was my mom’s gift.\\nAW: How so? Tell us a little bit more about that. Your mom’s gift—how did she make those\\nconnections happen?\\nJO: My mom and dad were quite different. My dad was very quiet, kind of an introvert. My mom\\nwas very outgoing and so throughout her whole life she would pull people together. She still\\nwould see her sorority sisters from the thirties until she became too frail; she was in her eighties\\nthen. And she was still—she just pulled people together. Our household was just chaotic with six\\nkids and she,--to add to the chaos--she would have foreign exchange students come and stay with\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n5\\nus too. Thinking we need to, you know, make this even richer, so we had exchange students in\\nour home, and crazy misplaced relatives. It was just a very wild, fun household growing up.\\nAW: Where did you grow up?\\nJO: White Bear Lake.\\nAW: When were you born?\\nJO: Nineteen hundred forty-seven, December 7th—that’s Pearl Harbor Day. And that’s the day\\nthat my mom died, on my birthday. My dad died six months before on my ten year anniversary\\nin AA, in recovery, so these two dates, it’s like (whispers) “go figure.”\\nIt took me a long time to unravel what those hidden gifts, what they meant. They were honoring\\nme in their own way. So what I do now on my parents’ birthdays I have people come up with—\\nand now back to piano. I have another family of people in my life: pianists. I have a great teacher\\nfrom Marine on St. Croix. We’d have musical events up here on my parents’ birthdays; we give\\nthem virtual presents of music on their birthdays. And then we have a meal and we all play, or\\npeople sing, or people play their instruments, or whatever they do. They have to all play or do\\nsomething for their supper. It’s just so much fun. (Laughs) Do you want to come to one?! You\\nhave to play though.\\nAW: Yes, I would love to! So tell us about these pianos—you have two grand pianos in here?\\nJO: Yes, my passion’s always been classical piano. But in high school I played show tunes\\n(Laughs). But then later on, just classical music was it. Classical piano, it’s just all I’d listen to.\\nAnd this is how it happened. I’ve always had a piano of various kinds but never played it; it was\\nfor friends. My mom ended up in a nursing home—she was ninety—and she didn’t have a long\\nor short-term memory. And in my search for my mom’s background, I found her only surviving\\nhigh school classmate. There were thirty-four in her class. I just found her; I did a lot of research.\\nShe’s still alive at ninety-six; she’s writing her second book. She was my mom’s best friend and\\nsaid, “Your mom was an amazing pianist. She would enter competitions throughout Iowa. She\\nplayed in the orchestra; she played at church.” And I didn’t know this—she stopped playing in\\n1940 to raise her kids. She never went back. And so Lucille sent me a roster of mom playing in a\\ncompetition in 1933. She played a piece by Edward MacDowell, who was a contemporary\\ncomposer. So I sent it to a friend who’s a pianist, who recorded it. So I went to the nursing home,\\nbecause I have all mom’s music from childhood. So I thought, “I have that music.” So I took it\\ninto the nursing home and I said, “Mom, do you remember playing this?” And she said “No.” So\\nI turned on the recorder and she was turning the pages, she was reading the music. I said,\\n“Wow,” and I said, “I’m going back to piano.” So I went in every other day for a lesson. And\\nthat’s mom right there, she’s ninety—we looked at the piano and she would just light up, she\\nwould get right in the zone, missed a beat, that’s the wrong note, she just came alive. That’s how\\nwe communicated because she wasn’t talking much. So, that’s how we connected. And that was\\nher final gift, was the gift of piano.\\nAnd so, I just decided I want really great pianos. I did research and I wanted a Mason & Hamlin\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n6\\nfrom the golden era that could be rebuilt because they were great pianos. This one came from\\nNew York and I had it rebuilt and refinished. And then a year later, I want another piano. I found\\nthis one at midnight; it’s a seven foot Mason & Hamlin. I was looking on craigslist, there’s a\\npiano, a Mason & Hamlin, this was built in 1917, my mother’s birth year. So her soul is in this\\npiano. I had to move the Earth to get it, to finance, refinance. I sold a bunch of stuff. It arrived;\\nit’s rebuilt, refinished.\\nA woman bought it for her son in 1974 who was a very accomplished pianist at fourteen—played\\nwith the Boston Pops—and he went on to study piano at Harvard, and his teacher just destroyed\\nhis sense of confidence. So he came to play it last year, he flew out with his partner, and he\\nplayed his childhood piano and we had a couple days together, and so—these pianos have\\nbrought this rich circle of friends and connections to people, and—\\nAW: What was that like? To connect with this young man who—?\\n00:17:20\\nJO: Well, he’s now fifty-some. He and his partner flew out, but there’s—\\nAW: So, was he selling the piano or what’s his—?\\nJO: His mother was.\\nAW: His mother was?\\nJO: Yeah, because he was living in California and his mother—they had to sell their house, they\\nwere in their eighties—and it just broke her heart because she also played. And so I called her up\\nand I said, “I want to buy your piano.” And she said, “Well, are you going to come play it?” And\\nI said, “Well, I live in Minnesota.” She thought I was scamming her. But the odd thing about this\\nwas, she talked in such a way that I thought, “He’s an only child.” And—he then switched to\\nstudying law, immigration. So, I just had this feeling. I had a feeling that he was a gay, as I am,\\nso I just kept going on the computer tch tch tch— I found him in California, and up came a\\npartner, Tom. It’s so bizarre. So, we became friends. We correspond and he’s been out and\\nthey’ll come out again.\\nAW: Wow. That’s a great example of, like you were saying, of these connections—the meaning\\nof objects and connecting people. That’s just really incredible. What did you guys play? Did you\\nguys do duets at all?\\nJO: No, he played my favorite piece I heard two years ago: a Brahms Intermezzo 117. I heard it,\\nI said to Mary, “I have to learn this, I have to.” It’s way beyond me, just way beyond me. I spent\\na year on two pages and I learned it, then it got sidetracked. You give me a project and we’ll do\\nit. He played that, that’s his signature piece. And when he came out, another person that came\\nout was the Steinway rep from Schmidt Music. He’s a friend of my teachers’ and her husband\\ndied and that’s what his favorite song—that’s what was played at his funeral. So it just has these\\nmultiple meanings. And it’s just an amazing piece. Do you know the piece?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n7\\nAW: I can’t conjure it up at this moment but I wrote it down so I’ll go and check it out. Can you\\nstill play a little bit?\\nJO: No, I’m on Sicilienne, the Fauré piece.\\nAW: Oh that’s right, yeah. Now which piece is this?\\nJO: It’s a Fauré piece, it’s Sicilienne; it’s a very well-known piece for piano and flute. I did\\nrehearse a bit with a woman who played the bass out in California. A woman, Carol Sauvion,\\nwho did this series on craft in America for public TV. You know that series? Carol used to be\\nmarried to Don McLean who did “American Pie” and “Starry Starry Night,” if you know those\\nsongs. Then they divorced before he made it big so they were really poor. She remarried and her\\nson was nine and they were driving in the mountains and her husband got out to chain—put the\\nchains on the car. He got back in the car and just died of a heart attack right there. And this poor\\nkid was so distraught that they, you know, therapy, and she sold the house to get a different\\nhouse. He grew up and he went to study bass at Bloomington and then he went to either Eastman\\nor Oberlin. Someone stepped forward and gave him sixty-five thousand dollars for a bass. And\\nnow his partner also plays the bass. So I practiced with her out in California, at Carol’s house.\\nBut there’s something about—I was in a twelve year relationship with another potter up until\\n1996. He was here this last year and we played a duet together and it was just so, so, so neat, just\\nso neat to do that. And then I was thinking, I have to find people in my life who really inspire\\nme. When you’re a child it just takes one person to open the door to show you your future. And\\nso I was able to find my high school art teacher. So he came out with his wife. And then I invited\\ntwo friends who were friends of mine from high school and it was just so neat. I had to trace\\nback to who fired my love of piano—my sixth/seventh grade junior high teacher, music teacher.\\nI found her. She was still alive so she came up with my piano teacher. We played duets and stuff,\\nit was just so neat, because I just adored this woman, Helen. When she came up I said, “Helen,\\nI’m not going to feed you until you change my report card.” (Laughs). I had that report card that\\nmom saved, they save everything you know, so, “There it is, over there.” I said, “Change it to an\\nA.” She said, “Okay” I said, “No, Helen, I want an A+.” (Laughs). Then we had a meal and we\\nplayed a duet together; it was just so neat.\\nI just love doing that—bringing people together. That was my mom’s gift; she was good at it.\\nDad was off doing his other stuff, you know. But all this, you know, how it fits is that I come\\nfrom a family of makers. We all made objects. I made potholders and trivets. And I still have\\nthem when I clean out the house. I use them in my slide presentation because you think back and\\nif something gets instilled—and my brother made leather purses and saddles, my sisters made\\nclothing and they knit. So the house is always—there were always prams all over the place and\\nall that happening. But my older brother, he made trouble, and my dad made money. That’s what\\nI say, (Laughs), they didn’t make things.\\n00:23:12\\nAW: (Laughs) How did your parents meet in the 1930s? You said at the U of M [University of\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n8\\nMinnesota] and then they moved into a place in White Bear Lake?\\nJO: They moved to White Bear Lake in the early forties in to a house in Birchwood. It’s a little\\nenclave off of the lake with maybe fifty houses. A couple years ago I kept having this dream\\nabout that house—I just couldn’t get it out of my head. That house was sold in 1958, we moved\\ndown to the lake. So, I thought, This is just nuts. I said, “What is it telling me?” I said, “I have to\\ngo to that house.” So I went to the house and my friend, my high school, my babysitter, lives\\ndown the road from me from when I was a kid and so, “Well, I know those people, I’ll get ya in\\nthere.” So I went there and there was an old, old couple there and I just remembered the same\\nsidewalk, I remembered the crack, I remember this window, I remembered it all—I left there\\nwhen I was ten. And then they had me stay for dinner. But to see these old people there, they\\nwere sitting in the same place where our couch was and have them serve dinner and it—you\\nknow, sixty years later, fifty—it was just profound, it was just amazing.\\nAW: Did you get a chance to walk through the house and see your old bedroom?\\nJO: I did.\\nAW: So that couple that bought it, that’s been there—?\\nJO: They’ve been there forty years.\\nAW: Wow.\\nJO: He just passed away. So the house is going to be on the market and I was thinking, “I wanted\\nto buy the house and move there.” But it doesn’t make any sense. It’s not practical, but again\\nit’s—with all this that’s happened in the sixties—for me—it’s all about searching for meaning,\\nmore meaning in my life. That’s what it’s about. And people do it in various ways.\\nAW: It sounds like for you one way has been to reconnect with teachers, friends, people of your\\npast, as well as new people that you’re meeting.\\nJO: Yes, right.\\nAW: Can you tell us more examples of searching for meaning in your life?\\nJO: It’s the meaning comes from people, connecting with people. So I got an email from Craig\\nRasmussen who’s Warren’s son-in-law and he said, “I’m curating an exhibition in White Bear\\nLake at the White Bear Center for the Arts, would you send a piece or two?” I said, “Sure.” And\\nhis address when he emailed me was this address in Bircher, where our first house was. I said,\\n“Do you live in the Butler house?” “No, that’s just around the corner.” So I was thinking of the\\nButler family that I knew as a kid. They had six children, they had five boys and then they had a\\ngirl, and they named them all in alphabetical order. I thought, Oh, Ellie Butler, she couldn’t be\\nalive. She’d be in her nineties, couldn’t be. He said, “Yeah, she’s alive, she’s just a spitfire, and\\nshe’s like five feet tall.” I looked up their address and then I did an aerial view and said, “That’s\\nmy high school art teachers’ house.” They bought that house when they moved when they were\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n9\\nold. There was a for sale sign on it and I said, “Oh no, they’re dead now.” So I thought, Hmm. I\\ncalled the church and he said, “Oh they’re still alive, they’re over at this nursing home, they’re\\nover in Mahtomedi at the St. Andrew’s.” I could not help myself. I should have been packing\\npots, I should have been working. I said, “I have to go see them.” I just got in the car and drove\\ndown there—I just could not stop myself—to just connect with these people after fifty-some\\nyears. But they weren’t there, but I’ll try again. So that’s an example of what it’s all about.\\nAW: That’s really amazing. I bet we’ll have more examples and stories as we continue on here.\\nTell us a little bit about your siblings then.\\nJO: Mom had three boys then she had three girls. She was very orderly, two years apart, except\\nthe last one is four years apart, and she arrived with red hair.\\nAW: Special.\\nJO: Right and, of course, she got teased because we all have dark hair, she got so teased. But it\\nends up that we’re just soul mates, we’re very close. We are, kind of, the wounded of the family.\\nWe’re the ones that—we kind of felt we didn’t fit. We were the last ones to be chosen when you\\nwere selected for a baseball team or something. We were always the last one. So we have the\\nsame life issues, we’re just the same. We get on the phone, we get right into therapy (Laughs).\\nAW: And what’s her name?\\nJO: That’s Nancy. She’s a gifted flutist and she went to St. Olaf to study flute. Midway through\\nshe changed careers, she was anxious about how to make a living, but she was exceptional. She\\nwas first chair in high school. She was so good. And she just changed, and it’s just, it’s\\nheartbreaking. So at Christmas time I made her get out her flute, she hadn’t touched it in ten\\nyears. “We’re going to practice this piece now, get with it now.”\\nAW: And how did she do? Did she just pick it up?\\nJO: Yeah.\\nAW: Wow, that’s great.\\nJO: You know, it’s the flute, and she was in college, she was getting discouraged so my parents,\\n“What can we do?” This is what my parents were made of: they went to England and they went\\nto the British Flute Guild, where they make the best, some of the best flutes in the world, and\\nbought her, had made a silver flute for her and gave it to her.\\n00:29:05\\nAW: You said, “That’s what your parents were made of—” What do you mean by that?\\nJO: Well, when I was in college studying ceramics I got discouraged, so my dad built a building\\nfor me and bought me a kiln, and it encouraged me. That’s just what they did; they were so\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n10\\nbehind their children. For them they always believed, We don’t care what you do, you have to be\\nhappy with what you’re doing. And so, when I told them I’m going to be a potter, they didn’t\\nfreak out. They said, “Great.” In fact when I was—I discovered clay in high school. I remember\\nplopping that clay down on that little wheel for the first time—it was a little tabletop, you know,\\nhobby wheel. Wow, this is just magic, it just took over. Then I went off to Bemidji State and\\ntook my pottery class there.\\nThe one person who was instrumental in pushing me into the art field was my Aunt Judy, who\\nwas very eccentric and she had this enormous life. She died in seventy-two, I think it was, and\\nshe was trained as a commercial artist in the forties. It was called commercial before it was\\ncalled graphic arts. And she just had a wild life, she never married, I think she was lesbian. She\\nhad bright red hair and long pointed, painted fingernails, and she always wore black fishnet\\nstockings, everything was black capes. She was just very dramatic with this deep voice and she\\nsmoked Pall Mall Straights and she drank a lot. And I couldn’t wait to grow up and smoke Pall\\nMall Straights and drink a lot—which I did, couldn’t wait. And she would come to visit us a lot,\\nbut she’d bring her paints and show us how to paint and do craft projects. She joined the\\nWAVES during the war, then the war’s over and she went to work for a paint company doing\\ncolor consulting and then she did TV commercials. And then she did this—she just really had\\nfun with her life. She was the one who encouraged me. It was her that I wanted to grow up and\\nbe an artist. I just thought this is really cool. A lot of family were kind of—because she was\\nmoody and temperamental, but I just adored her. When she was fifty-five she decided to go back\\nto school, she wanted to teach high school art and so she went to Bemidji State.\\nI ended up there because I wasn’t a great student in high school but they would take me. And she\\ntold me, “When you get there take this pottery class from Westy James, it will change your life.”\\nSo, as an incoming freshman I did, and I knew right away that I would be a potter. So, I kept on\\ntaking more classes and I was getting closer to graduation. I transferred to the University of\\nMinnesota in the process and I said to Warren MacKenzie, “I want to go work at the Leach\\nPottery.” The Leach Pottery is a pottery in St. Ives, England that was one of the first potteries\\nstarted by a contemporary potter, Bernard Leach, in 1920. They took apprentices; they took one\\neach year. Warren studied there in the early fifties, he said, “I’ll write you a letter of\\nrecommendation.”\\nSo, I flew over there with my parents for this interview. So that shows my parents’ support. And\\nthey said, “Come back in a year’s time.” I had to do one more year of school, so I was all set to\\ngo. About a week before [leaving] they had the draft and I remember being in the student lounge\\nat Bemidji State—because I went back up there for my last year—we were watching this on TV,\\nmy friends, my brother-in-law. They’re pulling numbers out of a barrel and I came up number\\nseven. And I thought, Oh crap, what am I going to do now? I’ve got this opportunity of a\\nlifetime. What do I do now? I flunked the physical so I was able to go. My parents came over\\nwhen I was living there three or four times, just to visit, and they fell in love with this town of St.\\nIves. It’s an old fishing village from the thirteenth century, the very southwest tip of England.\\nAnd they fell in love with this town, they went there, this town in their lifetime, seventy-seven\\ntimes.\\nThey just loved it with all their heart. When they passed away I wanted to go back to Leach\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n11\\nPottery and have an exhibition in their honor and spread their ashes there. They said, “Come on\\nover.” So I went there and the pottery, it’s all changed, it’s an institution now, they built more\\nbuildings, and the pottery that we were—it’s a museum now. And they said, “You can work in\\nthe new place or you can work in the museum,” which is cold and dank, no heat. I said, “I want\\nto work in that same corner I did forty years ago.” So they put a wheel there. I got on that wheel\\nagain and I just relived my life.\\nThe exhibition I titled 77 x 77, I had seventy-seven pots for the seventy-seven trips there. I rented\\nthe flat they rented and I slept in their bed. The morning of the exhibition, Dell, who was mom’s\\noldest friend who was eighty, we went and spread their ashes in town, then went to the opening.\\nIt was a very emotional trip there because I grieve for my parents and I grieve for the town that I\\nloved forty years before, which is now all classy. It was a working fishing village and artist\\ncolony that went way back to the 1880s. They had a town crier, they had little vegetable shops—\\nand it’s all [now] high-end houses. Back then they were two thousand dollars, now they’re half a\\nmillion. These rich people from London, they bought out property there, so it’s all changed.\\nThey can’t change the building because they’re all historic, from the thirteenth century, but I\\ngrieve for the town that I loved. I grieve for my parents. It was just highs and lows.\\nI had the opening on a Saturday night. I had a picture of my parents from when they were on\\ntheir twenty-eighth trip. The mayor heard about this couple who had been there so many times,\\nso my parents were interviewed and they were on TV, they had a party. I have a picture of them\\nshaking the mayor’s hand way back when. So I took it to the newspaper, the St. Ives Times and\\nthey go, “Oh, we’ll do a spread on this.” They did this big spread with old pictures of my folks\\nand me and then newer ones—it was basically to invite people who were still alive to come to\\nthe opening. It was just packed. I left the opening and I just started sobbing. I said, “Okay I can\\nnever come back here again, it’s over now.” I said, “No, I have to come back.” So I’m going\\nback in October, again with Pat, my friend who’s in Portland, to do a residency and have an\\nexhibition.\\nSo, I’ve been pulled back again. Like my parents were being pulled back, I’m being pulled back\\nagain. I’ll never make it seventy times, but I’ve been there maybe a dozen times. I’m pulled back\\nthere for this—I don’t know why, I’m just pulled back there. It’s to feel closer to my parents and\\nto see my friends who I had there. But it was so odd going back there and seeing friends—the\\nman that trained me in, who was a very well known potter, Bill Marshall, who is no longer alive.\\nWhen I lived there I helped his daughter, who was eleven, do her homework. So I went back to\\nsee her, I hadn’t seen her for forty years. So I knocked on her door, she opens it, and I said, “Jo?”\\nIt’s just so strange (gasp). “Jo.” So I went inside, she made a pie, and we just talked. Her mother\\nwas still alive, Marjorie, who I hadn’t seen for forty years. She’s in her eighties.\\nAnd then I went to see Sheila. I worked with her husband, Alan Brough, who’s no longer alive\\nand Sheila’s in her mid-to-late seventies. So, “Come over, I’ll meet you at so-and-so.” I get out\\nof the cab and I was looking, I was trying to find her, and there was this old lady walking down\\nthe street, she had pink and purple hair. I said, “No way,” but, “Sheila?!” “Yes!” And we just\\nhugged and just went inside and had this wonderful meal and just talked, talked, talked, talked.\\nIt’s one of the gifts of being older, is connecting with people from your past. It is just so much\\nfun to do that.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n12\\n00:37:50\\nAW: So, what drew you there in the very beginning? Why were you so interested in going to\\napprentice there?\\nJO: Because when I started pottery in the sixties, there were only three books out on ceramics.\\nAnd the one that was called “the Bible” was The Potters’ Book by Bernard Leach. I have an old,\\nworn copy from when I was a freshman, so all kinds of notes in it and everything. And so this\\nman, he wrote this, and became very well known throughout the world, and so he had this\\npottery and it was through just worshiping that book, and his philosophy, and the pots, and\\nknowing that Warren went there. I just said, “This is what I’m going to do.” I didn’t want to go\\non to graduate school to be a pottery teacher I just wanted to be a potter. I knew that that would\\ntrain me.\\nBut I have to tell you this other story, I don’t know how it relates but that Potter’s Book is no\\nlonger in print. Mine’s just worn and tattered, and everyone knows it’s, just, it’s “the Bible” from\\nback then. So in March, I was just missing my mom—and I do get signs that she’s around me\\nand in me, I just get these signs—and I was out there one night and said, “Oh mom, just give me\\na sign that you’re still part of my life, that you’re within me, you love me.” Nothing happened.\\nYou cannot demand a sign. It has to happen when it’s gonna happen. So, next day I was at Tim\\nHeil’s, who’s a friend of mine—I’ve known him for forty years, he’s been collecting my pots for\\nforty years, he has like a thousand of my pots. He’s just an amazing man. He’s a truck broker by\\nday and he’s a woodturner by night, and a collector of pots. And he just loves handmade\\neverything. His house, you go in and there’s a handmade boat hanging from the ceiling. He just\\nloves handmade everything, he’s just crazy about handmade things. His daughter was there,\\nwho’s about to go off to England to study art, who I’m very good friends with, and we’ve been\\nemailing. She was at a used bookstore, before her birthday party at Tim’s house, and she’s at a\\nused bookstore called Half Price, near her house. She was in the travel section trying to find\\nsome books about London and there was this misfiled book, a pottery book for ten bucks, so she\\nbought it. And we’re talking, the guests left after the birthday cake, and we’re just yakking, Tim\\nand his wife were there, and she said “I found this pottery book at the bookstore for ten bucks,\\nit’s called A Potter’s something.” And I said, “A Potter’s Song?” “No, I’ll go get it.” She got it,\\nand I said, “Well, that’s The Potter’s Book!” She opened it up, and I said, “That’s my mom’s\\nhandwriting.” (Whispers) It was my mother’s book.\\nAnd I said, “Oh my gosh.” I was just ready to sob, I said, “That’s her handwriting.” And in the\\nfront mom would always tape stuff, and there was a taped card of one of Leach’s pots. And I\\nsaid, “Let’s keep looking, I know there are other articles, she’d stuff articles in books.” And sure\\nenough, there are articles about his death in there and on their stationary from their home was\\nsome random notes about various stuff. But that was a sign, and I’ll never ever doubt that again.\\nWhen she’s with me, she’s taking care of me, overseeing, she’s part of it—dad too.\\nJulie said, “You can have this book.” “No, could I have the one letter?” I said, “Now this has a\\nwonderful history to it.” So now she does, she’s studying pottery as well, but so bizarre.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n13\\n00:41:35\\nAW: So, she’s kept the book?\\nJO: Yeah.\\nAW: What drew your parents to go back to your studio and go to St. Ives again and again and\\nagain?\\nJO: They just love this village because it’s just like stepping back in time. And when they came\\nover to visit me—they came over four times when I lived there—and they just fell in love with\\nthe town and my friends. What they did was they kept my friendships alive. And mom would\\nalways bring on the plane a frozen turkey, and she’d make a big turkey dinner for my friends\\nthere. And that was just so mom, she was just very giving. And next door to their flat there was a\\nman who was mentally handicapped, who was a painter, who became very well known in his\\nlife. He passed away maybe ten years ago, Bryan Pierce, extremely well known painter, but he\\nwas mentally handicapped. And when Bryan came home one day—all Bryan does was play with\\nhis train set and painted, until he died—he came home one day and his father was dead on the\\nfloor and he just stepped over him and started doing his, it didn’t register—but he was this\\nbrilliant painter. So they lived next door to mom. Mom would cook meals for them and they’d\\ninvite them for dinner. But that was just my mom, she was very giving, very generous. So they\\nloved this town and kept going back and they had friends and friendships and they just loved it.\\nThey kept going back until they couldn’t walk anymore. So they kept my friendships alive and\\ntheir flat was on the other side where Bernard Leach lived. And he was old, he was in his\\nnineties then, so he was lonely, so they would visit with him too. So they kept that friendship\\nalive too. They were this courier between England and me and that was a gift.\\nAW: What about going back to when you got off the plane and went to the studio that very first\\ntime. Can you tell us more about that experience?\\nJO: I was so freaked out. I thought I was a pretty good potter, so I walked into this place, I got\\nthere early—and that’s not me, I’m always late—and I got there early and I went into the stock\\nroom and there were just thousands of pots piled up on racks. And I thought, “Oh man, I really\\ngot myself into such a jam here.” I’m thinking, I can’t do this, but when I make a commitment I\\nstick to it. It was two years, and so, day one, Bill Marshall would train me in. I had a wheel\\nacross from him. He took out a bowl and then he made one just like that—you know production\\nlines—and he said, “Okay, make twenty of these.” And I thought, Oh, I can make twenty in two\\nyears, and he meant twenty by noon! They had to be of a certain height and a certain weight\\nwithin like a sixteenth of an inch, they had to be spot-on. And he said, “This is wrong, this is\\nwrong, this is wrong,” and tossed them away. For two months I tossed away maybe a hundred a\\nday, but just kept tossing them away. Tossing ‘em away, like this is wrong, this is wrong, this is\\nwrong. And what that one bowl did, it just humbled me and I realized that good pots are a\\ncomposite of all this nuance. You have to look at every single part of the piece is critical, to kind\\nof sum up to be this good pot. So that’s what I learned from that, the thing of critical observation\\nand importance of every nuance. So it’s basically just that kind of training, just be so observant.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n14\\nBut I can now see—and now that I’m back to playing the piano—they’re so similar in terms of\\nhow one approaches it. My teacher: it’s scales, it’s triads. I went to my first lesson three years\\nago and I practiced this Bach piece for like a month. So I sit down, and I call, I said, “Mary, this\\nis Jeff Oestreich, I heard about you.” And a friend told me she was a really old-fashioned teacher\\nand I thought, Oh great. I wanted the best teacher around. And so I get there, “Hello, now here’s\\nthe piano—sit down and play something.” So I open up the Bach, I play two measures and she\\nsays, “Stop, shut the book.” And it was triads like a month or so, triads and scales, over and over.\\nAnd I’m trying to think—but that’s necessary to build this foundation. It’s the same with pots,\\nyou have to make this pot a thousand times before you really get it. So they’re cousins.\\n00:46:12\\nAW: What were some of the nuances that you were starting to notice? When making these pots,\\nwhat were some of the things you started to see and you had to do to—\\nJO: Anything added on, any kind of line, where lines were put on, any kind of lugs or detail\\nwhere the brush would hit, all this subtlety, anything that you added onto the form. And also the\\nsurface of the pot had to be interesting, couldn’t be flat, had to have some music to it. And the lip\\nhad to be just right too, and how that was shaped. So every single thing had to be just spot-on.\\nWhen I look at my training there, Bernard then was in his eighties, he didn’t train us in, he\\ncriticized, he would critique our one-of-a-kind pieces that we’d make on weekends or evenings.\\nThe production-ware that we kind of, we cut our teeth on, that was made, we made that forty\\nhours a week. So when I arrived there I was paid fifteen dollars a week, and you could just\\nsqueeze by. Five dollars went to your rent, five went to the pub, and five went for groceries, and\\nyou could just squeak by. You could work some overtime, you get twenty-five cents an hour\\novertime. But we were so poor. We didn’t think we were poor though, we were all in the same\\nboat and when you come from college to there, it’s all the same thing. And my first flat that I\\nrented was the size of—from the fireplace, the edge of that wall to where the bricks are to here,\\nthe whole apartment, that whole thing. There was a tiny little bedroom that I had to sleep\\ndiagonal in the bed because it was only five feet wide, the bedroom. The living room had a\\nkitchen that folded out from the wall. There was no fridge, people didn’t have fridges back then.\\nSo, it was just tiny, and you shared the bathroom in the hallway and in the basement there was a\\nbathtub, you’d share that with the people in the other two flats. We didn’t think we were poor,\\nthough; this is just our life.\\nThere were many times I was very unhappy there, feeling I was exploited. I remember Janet\\nLeach ran the place, it was Bernard’s third wife. She was actually a Texan, who was thirty-five\\nyears younger. And she was just tough as nails, and she just smoked like a fiend and drank—\\nalcoholic, and we got along: just a hard, tough Texan who used to weld ships during the war. She\\nwas a boss there. Once I was thinking, I made a hundred bowls and they were sold for two\\npounds apiece, I thought, A hundred times that and I’m only getting this much from all that? So I\\nentered her office and I said, “Janet, I make a hundred bowls a day and they’re selling for like\\ntwo pounds apiece and you’re only paying us—I think I need a raise.” She said, “No.” So I just\\nwent back on the wheel and got going, “Grrrrr.” So there were times I was unhappy, I felt\\nexploited. But cocky American—we have no idea what the apprenticeship system is about here,\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n15\\nit’s a dead system here. It’s coming back though, in some fields. So I had nothing to compare it\\nto, so it is, in a sense, it’s slave labor, but you learn, that’s how you learn.\\nAnd mom saved everything. Mom saved all my letters I wrote back home every week to them.\\nYou know, a couple times a week I’d write a letter back and aerogram, they had those back then.\\nAnd if you wanted to call them, which they did once a year, you’d have to call the operator and\\nsay, “I want to call America.” And they’ll say, “Okay, we’ll call you when we get a free line.”\\nThen you just hang up, then maybe an hour later, or two, you’d get a call, “Operator, okay we\\nhave a line for you Mr. Oestreich.” You’d talk for a minute or two. So now, you just get out that\\ncell phone and you Skype it—\\nBut anyway, how you felt so far away, you’re at the end of the earth. So I wrote those letters.\\nTowards the end there’s a lot of anxiety about how I’m going to make a living and I know I can\\ndo it, I know I can do it, but—Bernard and Janet were in Japan traveling and weren’t going to be\\nback in time for my departure. They sent a telegram that they were going to be a week late, if I\\ncould please stay. I just said, “No, I’m getting the hell out of here. You’ve got my two years to\\nthe day, I’m going to come back to America and I’m getting my pottery going, I’m just going to\\nshow people I can do this.” And so I never saw Bernard again, he died not too long after that. I\\nregret—I wish I would’ve stayed that extra week. But I did go back and see Janet a number of\\ntimes, but I didn’t see Bernard again, because of my—I just had to get out of there, I just wanted\\nto do it now. I’m trained now, I want to be a potter, and so—\\n00:51:25\\nAW: When Bernard did the critiques, what was that like?\\nJO: They’re short and to the point, and he could sum up a pot with just a gesture or one sentence.\\nIt’s not how critiques are now in universities. Now critiques go on hours, and I can make them\\ngo on for hours. You get me going on a pot and it’s just di di di di. But just one sentence and he\\nwould just sum it up. He could just see it and just tsh tsh tsh, get to the point and— But it was—I\\nmean this was forty years ago—but now you go off to teach—one thing that’s happened over the\\nlast couple, three decades, this whole language has been developed about how we talk about\\ncrafts and how we talk about pots. Attach it to metaphor or this or that and the other, and how\\nthis is a much more richer language of how to talk about pots. But back then there really wasn’t a\\nwhole lot of language and how we talked about pots. It was through observation, and osmosis,\\nthrough comparison, a couple sentences—the field was young then. Now there are thousands of\\nbooks, there’s a lot more than three now.\\nAW: Who were some of your colleagues, who were apprentices as well?\\nJO: John Bedding, who’s my age. When I arrived they had four apprentices and then they had a\\ncouple of full time workers, and some “odd bods” who would do clay mixing and such. I was an\\nAmerican, there was a woman from Australia, I replaced a woman, Chantel who was French, and\\nthere was a Japanese potter there who just arrived. So there was always a mix of people. When I\\nwas there actually I was pretty stable because Shigeyoshi had just arrived, the Japanese man. The\\nJapanese man and I, we became close because we arrived at the same time. He was much more\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n16\\nadvanced in throwing than I was, he had great skills as a potter. But we were these foreigners,\\nexcept for Judy, so we bonded. And Trevor was there, he was a thrower and he did stacking the\\nkilns, he’s still alive, no longer working there. John Bedding arrived about that same time, he\\nwas also born in forty-seven, and we all became friends. It’s like this family, this dysfunctional\\nfamily, this divided, dysfunctional family—\\nAW: What made it—?\\nJO: And that part of it was a shock because I came from this large happy family, were you didn’t\\nexpress any kind of emotions, you just keep them in. But there, there were battles and fights.\\nAnyway, Bernard died and Janet ran it for another twenty years and then she died and it closed.\\nIt was closed for a while. And then it was in danger of being bulldozed, the buildings on it. So\\nJohn Bedding got people together and started a trust and raised a couple million dollars and\\nhooked it up with an art school in the area, and saved it. So now it’s this institution where they\\nhave built a new studio, they built a new kiln area, they built a new museum, they built a new\\ngallery, and then they bought the house next door, which, they’re teaching children’s classes\\nthere now. So they just reached out into the community now, which is so neat. John is now head\\nof the pottery production there. And there couldn’t be a better person to do that. So they just\\nhired him, so I’ll be able to go back and spend some time with him in that building. It’s going to\\nbe so much fun. I’m going to pay him back for all those tricks he pulled on me.\\n00:55:45\\nAW: (Laughs) What kind of tricks?\\nJO: They were always teasing me. One trick was we had to wedge up—in the morning—balls of\\nclay that were maybe two pounds apiece, and there were scales in the back there—so I get on the\\nwheel, trying to make this bowl that had to be exactly, like six and a half inches across, and I just\\ncouldn’t, it just wouldn’t, there wasn’t enough clay there, I couldn’t get it up enough. John and\\nTrevor, he was part of it too, they put some extra weight underneath the scale, a ball of clay, so\\nall my balls weighed the wrong amount. Another time, oh, they tied my wheel shut so I couldn’t\\nmove the crank bar. Another time they put in a ball of clay, they had this dye, this powder that\\nthey used to powder the glazes. They put some in a little ball of clay, so I opened up the kind\\nof—and, Oh, there’s red all over the place, what is going on here? Stuff like that. Another time,\\nI’m terrified of snakes and they have a snake there called an adder, which is poisonous. So, Alan\\ncomes in one day, he was a real joker, “Oh my god, I got bitten by an adder!” And I thought,\\n“Oh my god!” And so (gasp), “I’ll get the car and take you to the hospital”—and “just kidding!”\\nIt’s just stuff like that, they’re always teasing me, if they get a rise out of me.\\nAW: Did you tease them back? Did you have any tricks?\\nJO: No, but I did, I talked Johnny into playing strip poker with his girlfriend, I won—YES!\\n(Laughs)\\nAW: (Laughs) There you go—that’s a good trick. So, it was Johnny Bedding.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n17\\nJO: John Bedding.\\nAW: Alan—?\\nJO: Alan Brough is no longer alive. And it’s his wife that had the colored pink and blue, purple\\nhair, which is so cool, she’s a seamstress.\\nAW: Sheila?\\nJO: Sheila Brough, yeah.\\nAW: How do you spell her last name?\\nJO: B-r-o-u-g-h.\\nAW: And then who were these other students? You said there was an Australian—\\nJO: Her name is Judy Gardner and she’s no longer making pots, but she lives in town.\\nAW: Here in Minnesota?\\nJO: No, in St. Ives. She didn’t move away, well she specifically lives in London and St. Ives,\\nthey have a second home there.\\nAW: And then there was a French—?\\nJO: Oh, she left, I replaced her. Chantel.\\nAW: And the Japanese potter?\\nJO: His name was Shigeyoshi. S-h-i-g-e-y-o-s-h-i, last name is I-c-h-i-n-o. And he passed away\\nlast year. And how he got there was when Janet was young, in her twenties, she went to work in\\nShigeyoshi’s pottery. And Shigeyoshi’s pottery is from this remote mountain village where\\nthey’re all potters. His pottery had been passed on for seven hundred years and so Shigeyoshi\\ninherited the pottery, and so that’s where Janet trained back in the fifties. He came over to\\nEngland, he was twenty-five, and he came over to learn how to make more western pots, because\\nthe diet in Japan was changing. There’s not that need for the rice bowls and sake cups, they were,\\ntheir diet was becoming more western. So he came over to learn how to make plates and things\\nthat were more—and pitchers and things, that were more appropriate to their changing diet. But\\nhe passed away last year, unexpectedly.\\nAW: What were the requirements for doing the apprenticeship? How did you get the\\napprenticeship? You said that MacKenzie had put in a good word?\\nJO: He wrote a letter of recommendation.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n18\\nAW: Were there other things you had to do to apply for this?\\nJO: I showed them some slides or photographs. And first I talked to Janet, and I was just so\\nfreaked out talking to her, and then she’ll, “I’ll take you down to visit Bernard.” Because they\\nweren’t married yet, they had separate kind of lives. So I went down and I met Bernard. And\\nJanet said, “Just come back in a year, we’ll have a slot in a year’s time.” And so, it just worked\\nout perfect. Though, when I think of the pots I showed though, oh, just crap. So I learned a\\ntremendous amount, being there. And I just, I grew up there, that’s where I felt I really sort of\\ngrew up. It’s the first time I had scotch for lunch. I smoked my first joint there.\\nWhen I was in college pot wasn’t around then, it just wasn’t. It was shortly after that, like a\\ncouple years later. So when I was in England there was a woman from America that came over\\nto work just the summer, who was unpaid. She was kind of an odd duck, she’s no longer alive,\\nHelene. But she was just lots of fun. She was so clumsy though, just this walking clumsy. One of\\nher jobs was to stack the kiln and she’d be breaking pots and I thought—I remember once we\\nwere at this secretary’s house and the secretary had one of Bernard’s drawings above the mantel,\\nlike this, and Helene had a glass of wine and she was going to walk up to it, and I just said—I\\njust know what’s going to happen now because there was a little bit of ledge by the hearth—I\\njust knew it. And sure enough, she tripped and it went on the thing.\\nBut, the worst was I talked her into—I know I shouldn’t have done this—I talked her into renting\\na Vespa motor scooter, because I had a motorcycle. So we go over to this town and we rent hers,\\nand we get a little Vespa for her, and she gets a helmet and we’re leaving town—we’re going on\\nthis back road and I remember seeing this, I saw this wall when I was there last—there’s this\\nstone wall that bends like this in the road. And I thought, “Oh, this is not going to go—please\\ndon’t hit, please don’t hit this wall.” So she just went right into it, right into that wall. She wasn’t\\nhurt, thank God. The bike was all bent up so they needed to come and pick it up. She was a really\\ngood sport. We became good friends because we were Americans and felt misplaced. But when I\\nthink of my education there, it was, it came through—we’d go to the pub every Saturday night,\\nand then we’d go back to Alan’s house. And we’re sitting in this big circle, like this, and all\\nyakking away, and someone lit up a cigarette and he was passing this cigarette to the other\\nperson. And I thought, “That’s very odd.”\\nSo, this thing is being passed—and Helene just whispers to me, “don’t inhale it.” And of course,\\nI did, and of course, I smoked it every week, you know with all the rest of them. But when I\\nthink back on those years, the learning—it came through the making of the pots. And world-renowned\\npotters would come there to visit, so we had that connection when other potters came\\ndown to visit. It’s just very rich in terms of living in this artists’ colony with these great artists\\nand kind of being on my own for the first time in this foreign country. It was a great experience,\\nit was very difficult though, trying to fit in there. They’d tease about my American accent all the\\ntime. But I felt I really kind of grew up there.\\n01:03:10\\nAW: To take a few steps back, in high school you mentioned you had your first experience with\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n19\\nclay was with your high school art teacher?\\nJO: Correct.\\nAW: All right, tell us about your art teacher and that moment, those classes.\\nJO: I had two art teachers, I had Teddy Warikois, a woman who is no longer alive.\\nAW: How do you spell her last name?\\nJO: W-a-r-i-k-o-i-s—it was Theodora, her nickname was Teddy, so Teddy Warikois. And the\\nother one was Frank Zeller, who—he’s seventy-five and he was one of the founders of the White\\nBear Center for the Arts way back when, if you know their art center.\\nThey’re both just great teachers. When he was up here, last year, he said he let me in the room so\\nI could make pots at night, but I don’t remember that part at all. But I remember they were really\\ngood teachers. It was his first year of teaching; he was a young man then. I’d been taking art\\nclasses as—throughout my entire life. As a kid—I always loved the making of things and\\npainting and all that. But I knew when I threw that ball of clay down on that little wheel—what it\\nwas—a love of this material and also trying to master that technique of getting the clay on center\\nand pulling up a cylinder. That part was challenging, and I tend to gravitate to those sorts of\\nthings where you have to learn a technique—you have to master it. That part I related to—\\nThen when I got to Bemidji State and took my first class, my teacher there was Westy James, a\\nwoman who was actually a grad school student of Warren’s in the early sixties.\\nAW: How do you spell her first name?\\nJO: W-e-s-t-y.\\nAW: Just “Westy?”\\nJO: Um hm. She died maybe thirty years ago. Westy was not a good potter. She was a really\\ngreat educator, and so she was very supportive and I just adored her, she was a great teacher. But\\nshe only made maybe a dozen pots a year, for the faculty show, because she was an educator.\\nShe taught art history and materials and pottery, etcetera.\\nWhen I was there as a freshman, Warren MacKenzie came to do a workshop with John Reeve, a\\nCanadian potter who’s no longer alive. They did this workshop and I was just amazed at the\\noutput, they just made hundreds of pots in that weekend. I just couldn’t believe all the pots they\\nmade. Shortly after that a friend and I went down, we were down in the cities, and we went to\\nvisit Warren in his studio. There were just racks of pots, just hundreds of pots, everywhere. And\\nthey were working away. I remember I showed Warren—I made this big bowl, what a dog—and\\nI showed it to him and he didn’t say a word about it. Just looked at it and turned it over—it was a\\npiece of crap (laughs). But that’s when I got the glimpse of what a potter, a working potter’s, life\\nwas all about, through that. This is what a potter does. And that was attractive, that lifestyle was\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n20\\nattractive.\\nI did get a sense of that reading The Potter’s Book and reading The Potter’s Book I tend to\\nromanticize everything. So I just romanticized what it would be like to be there, working. I\\nthought you’d maybe make pots for a little bit and then you’d have tea on the lawn. Get served\\ntea and then go take a swim on the beach or something, come back and—I just romanticized\\nwhat it would be like.\\nThe reality of it and—but I knew, I caught on pretty quick that it’s—when I came back here it’s\\nnot going to be a romantic, charming life. A lot of its just donkeywork. And there’s still a great\\nsatisfaction of working with my hands. But, when the pot comes out of the kiln I lose my\\nattachment to it. They’re just sold and they just go away and that’s fine. They need to do their\\njob. So I don’t save many of my pieces because I just move on to the next idea.\\nWhat I do love about it is the freedom to choose my rhythm of work. I work late at night, I don’t\\nlike mornings at all. I get up at ten, and then I go make coffee, and I go back to bed and I call\\nJackie at two, and she’s in bed and we have coffee together over the phone. And then I grab my\\niPad and deal with correspondence and stuff like that. And then I get up, and I don’t get out there\\nsometimes until noon, one, two, three, four, five. Then I work until midnight, one or two,\\nbecause I like night—I like nighttime. I think I have AD—.\\nAW: Like ADD or ADHD?\\nJO: Yes, I just bounce around in the morning. Do a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and just do\\nall this—and then, it gets dark and I can calm down and I can focus. That’s just me. And you\\nknow what, I’ve just learned I have to just let it run its course. I can’t contain it much, just have\\nto live with it. I can drive people around me nuts.\\nIn the wintertime I can get a lot of work done because you can’t be outside, you’re stuck inside.\\nSo that fits a potter’s life too, because it’s interior activity. And it’s really odd to say, I’ve got\\nforty-five acres, I think I’ve hiked the property, or skied it, maybe twice in forty years. I just\\nwalk between here and the house and maybe a bit out there. Why am I living out here? Solitude,\\nit’s having control over the environment and I love to be able to look out and hear things. And\\nI’m not an outdoorsy hiker, or head to the mountains and hike, I’m just not—I’m fat and lazy\\n(laughs).\\nAW: It sounds like you’re quite busy to me.\\nJO: I get a lot done, I do, once I get going--tsh tsh tsh--I get a lot done.\\n01:10:15\\nAW: So how did you come to get this house? Why did you move out here? When did you move\\nout here?\\nJO: I moved out here in ’74. When I came back from England I rented a house out in the country\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n21\\nnear River Falls and I was renting a place, it was thirty-five bucks a month. It didn’t have any\\nrunning water inside and it was an old dumpy farmhouse and I cleaned up the barn and made a\\nstudio out in the barn. I was part of the whole “back-to-the-earth” movement. And that was a\\nreally fun part of my life. With some friends, we had an old farmhouse that we were fixing up\\nand we grew our own food and had Volkswagen buses and things (laughs). We got Mother\\nEarth’s News—if you know that magazine?\\nThe Foxfire books—the whole “back-to-the-earth” movement was about being self-sustaining,\\nhow you live and growing your own food, and cutting wood, and heating with wood, and kind of\\n“opting out.” So I just fit in with that movement, it just fit. And there’s a lot of mutual support.\\nAnd part of that whole thing was the making of crafts too. That was dovetailed in with the “back-to-\\nthe-earth” movement too, so it all just kind of fit together. Until the barn burned down—in\\n‘73, I think it burned down. I didn’t have insurance because we were part of that whole\\nmovement so you were “anti-insurance,” “anti-establishment,” so I lost the whole lot.\\nI ended up buying this place about a year later. I knew I couldn’t be any further than an hour\\naway from Minneapolis/St. Paul. I just drew a circle around the Twin Cities and I checked\\nsouthwest—I love Wisconsin, but I couldn’t find anything there. And I had some realtors looking\\nand I put ads in papers. But I’d spent time just driving out to the country and finding places that\\nwere abandoned and checking out the owner. I had a card file and was very methodical. It took a\\nyear and there was an ad in the Sunday paper, said, “Handyman Special: Hobby Farm on 5\\nAcres, bring your hammer.” And it was just a wreck of a house. The only things that are original\\nare the studs; basically I’ve done all the work myself. I leveled floors, gutted it, changed\\nwoodwork, done all the plumbing and the heating stuff, and that’s what’s taken so long because I\\nlove a project. And it’s all about a project. Although, owning an old house, it’s overwhelming in\\nthe amount of—it needs a new roof now, but I’m not going to put the roof on anymore, I’m just\\ngonna hire that out, but the siding hasn’t been stained in twenty years and the floor should be\\nsanded. I haven’t painted the walls in thirty years and I just can’t keep up with it. And so, some\\nfriends of mine from Australia—what I had here for a number of years is what I’ve called a “clay\\ncamp.” I would invite potters from my travels that would come and work here for two months\\nright before the Tour and I invited friends here. Once there were Australians, and there were\\nEnglish folks, and people from New Zealand, people I met in my travels, when I was working\\noverseas and liked. “Come, work with me.” Then we’d have the Tour and they’d make enough\\nmoney to finance the whole thing. And that was really fun while it lasted. But Sandy was here,\\nfrom Australia, and she’s just the neatest person. We’re so much alike—she made her house. She\\nmade five thousand bricks and built her house.\\nSandy—so they made a list, they went around their property and they made a list—they live out\\nin the country too, and built their buildings—they just made a list of things not to do, but things\\nto leave, to not do in their lifetime to free up money and time, that they could just let go. And I\\njust love that, so I’m kind of doing that too. The only things I want to keep up are my car and the\\npianos and the next owner can repair stuff because I’d rather do other things than that. One thing\\nthat’s happened—when your parents die your whole world changes, and what you think is\\nimportant just changes, and it’s a big lesson. Because I went in there two or three times a week—\\nI’d drive to White Bear two or three times a week, to see my folks. And they ended up both in\\nthe same room. They put the bed together, the last six months they were able to be there. I\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n22\\nrealized that I was missing out on a lot by being this little workaholic. I would isolate a lot and\\nget a lot of work done. Now: Oh I’ll do that later, and I’ll go play with some friends. So that was\\na lesson that was long in coming about what’s really important. It’s about being with friends\\nrather than making another run of cups or something.\\n01:15:45\\nAW: So relationships have been really important to you.\\nJO: Yes.\\nAW: Sounds like they always have—maybe more so now when you’re making time for them.\\nJO: Right, yep— And, I went fishing a couple weekends ago. Can you believe that?\\nAW: (Laughs) I don’t know, are you an avid fisherman?\\nJO: Not at all—no, hate it, no—but I go to be with friends. We go up to Lake of the Woods, and\\nthey have a cabin. And I can put the minnow on my—do you know how to fish?\\nAW: Just a bit, not well.\\nJO: Do you know how to fish?\\nTM: A little bit.\\nJO: So I can put them—I didn’t for a couple years put the minnow on, Deb would do that\\nbecause “Eww, creepy.” I put the minnow on though, I just grab it and do what you do, and I put\\nthat thing down—but I don’t, when I reel in the fish I don’t touch them. John or Deb, they do\\nthat. I say, “Oh I got one here!” And then they’d touch it and they’d do—you know, because I’ve\\nnever touched one.\\nAW: Do you keep them and eat them?\\nJO: We keep them. I’m not one to brag: two weeks ago I caught a twenty-four and a half inch\\nwalleye. It had to go back because it was over the limit. And then sadly, I had to go catch a\\nbunch of fourteen inchers. If it’s under twelve you have to throw it back. So, there’s that range\\nand I caught half a dozen fish. John does all the flaying. I don’t know how to do that and I don’t\\ncare to do that.\\nAW: Yeah, that’s a tough job too (laughs).\\nJO: Yeah, right, that’s an art. But you do it. And then I went ice fishing a number of times. And\\nice fishing gives you bragging rights. It just makes for a great story when you’re in a different\\nstate or out of the country. “You’re doing what?! When it’s twenty below?!” And it’s—have you\\never ice fished? I go with Deb and then her husband and Jackie. The last time I went it was\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n23\\ntwenty-some below. I just couldn’t wait until they had to go pee outside. I just really teased them\\na lot. It’s just, it’s brutal, it’s just brutal. Why do you do that? It’s just so, the whole thing of it,\\nand this little box way out when it’s twenty below looking down this hole (laughs). You step\\nback and look at it and, but it’s just—why not?\\nAW: It’s a way of enjoying being outside, I guess.\\nJO: Well, we had a heated house that we rented. Oh I’m not going to be standing outside, Ooo,\\nno way. But, I just figure, why not? And on my bucket list is—I’m going to go skydiving. I was\\ngoing to do that on my sixtieth but there’s one in Baldwin, that’s not very far from here, so I was\\nresearching it and that day someone’s chute didn’t open. This guy had four thousand jumps and\\njust, there was this accident. So then I started YouTubing, you can YouTube and see accidents\\nfor people that skydive. Have you ever done that? So that really turned me off. I thought, Oh, I’m\\nnot gonna do that. But I’m warming up to it again.\\nWhen dad died, it was on my ten-year anniversary, I thought I have to turn this day into one of\\njoy. So I bought eight tickets for my friends to go up in a hot air balloon, but they had to cancel\\nbecause of the weather. And then I couldn’t get them—so I sold somebody the tickets and I went\\nup on my own—well, with a group of people I did. We went over my lake where I grew up and\\nI’ve got one more ticket, and I’m going to do it—maybe I’ll do it on the twenty-first, on dad’s,\\nthe anniversary of his death, yeah that’s what I’ll do.\\n01:20:10\\nAW: Wow, that’s great. So what did your dad do?\\nJO: My dad manufactured water softeners. His business partner was Bill Steger whose son Will\\nwent to the North Pole. Will and I worked on occasion at dad’s factory so I knew him when I\\nwas a kid. I haven’t seen him for many, many years. I did write to him because dad told me\\nbefore he died that Will came to the office and wanted money from his father and my dad. My\\ndad says, “I’ll give you money if you promise to pee my name on the North Pole.” That’s so\\nDad. So I wrote to Will a while ago to see if that was true, but he didn’t write back.\\nSo, my dad loved making money. He was successful in business; he made a ton of money in his\\nlife, just made a ton. But he was very generous; he gave a lot of money away. He sold his first\\nbusiness—he was forty-nine and took all us kids around the world, a trip. This is 1966, and we\\nleft Seattle and went to Hong Kong, and then Tokyo and Kyoto and Thailand and Lebanon and\\nthrough Europe, and then England. And then what they do is they’d go back to favorite spots. So\\nthey traveled every year. They did a lot of traveling. And dad just spent his fortune on that.\\nWell, when he died there was hardly a penny, he blew it all, just blew it all and had good times.\\nSo dad, “I don’t care, you educated us, we had a lot of fun, just don’t worry about the inheritance\\nthing at all.” I think you know, once your parents go, is that you realize how from each of them\\nyou get this part of them. And my dad, I got his, like I haven’t saved a nickel for retirement or—I\\njust don’t save it. It just goes to this place. This place is where the money just gets gobbled up.\\nBetween this, or piano lessons or something—it just does, but I know I can just make some more\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n24\\nof it.\\nMy dad and my mom gave me this sense of adventure and curiosity, which are key components\\nof being a creative person. And they were very curious. Mom was a very curious woman, very\\nwell educated, very smart. She read every night until two in the morning, she was just this\\nvoracious reader. One thing that mom did is that when she started having her kids, is that she\\ndidn’t let the kids get in the way of her life, being out there, active. She would see her sorority\\nsisters, and League of Women Voters, and AFS thing—she was always out there doing stuff.\\nShe’d get all gussied up and just take off. We had a live in maid for many years that kind of\\nraised us and would do the laundry and stuff like that. And then we got older and mom, “No, you\\ncan manage without the maid.” And so, “You’re on your own, kids.” She didn’t let us get in the\\nway of her growth. Which, that’s really a modern thing now, then in the forties, that was a\\ndifferent deal back then. And I just remember, and to this day if I see a chicken pot—a\\nSwanson’s chicken potpie—I always think of abandonment. Because mom and dad would get all\\ngussied up to go somewhere and mom would throw in a bunch of those chicken pot pies for us\\nsix kids—just throw them in the oven, “Just take them out in a half hour, we’re outta here.” And\\none thing I always remember with mom—looking back, before she left, to see if the seams were\\nstraight on her nylons. (Whispers) Did you know the nylons used to have the seam in the back?\\nAW: Um hm.\\nJO: It’s true—and so I always think of—when I think of chicken pot pies I always think of\\nabandonment and I think of mom checking on the back of her legs (laughs).\\nSo the two of them just gave me these ingredients to be who I am now—to have this sense of\\nadventure. I can do this and be serious in the studio. Yet my dad was a fun, adventuresome—\\nhe’d say, “Okay kids, pack your suitcases, we’re going to Mexico now.” And this was over\\nChristmas break. And we’d say, “Okay dad.” And we’d haul off and just had a lot of fun\\ntraveling as a family, just lots of fun. That was his gift to us, this adventure thing. So I’m—and\\nas you get older I realize that I have—I’m turning into my parents (laughs).\\n01:25:20\\nAW: Yeah, so are you traveling more now?\\nJO: Just when I said that—I’m really kind of tired of traveling. Though I’m going off next week\\nto teach in North Carolina and then going back to England in September, and I have other\\nworkshops out of the state throughout the year. One thing I’m aware of too: that a potter’s life is\\nnot just to sit and work in isolation for long periods. You need to be out there in the world. And\\nso that’s where my ideas come from, they come from getting out in the world. I can look at a\\npiece and say, “Okay, I got that ribbing from my trip to Australia,” for instance, “and this one\\ncame from New Zealand.” My whole love of Art Deco in the work—that hard-edged stuff came\\nfrom walking this town in New Zealand. It’s all Art Deco architecture from the late twenties. So,\\nI gather, when I go out there, I gather—it’s like fishing—I gather out there. Then I come back\\nand I refine it in my studio and I refine it and get the idea going. And that’s my source; the world\\nis my source. When I was training as a potter, we just looked at historical pots, or we looked in\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n25\\nthe magazines. We weren’t encouraged to look into other areas of art, or to other experiences, or\\nto other stuff. I lived with that for years and years and years until I hit Napier, this village in New\\nZealand. I walked into this village and I thought, This is what I’ve been after, this is it.\\nGeometry, I’ve always loved geometry. Susan walked in one day and said, “That bracelet—”\\nwhich came from Taos, New Mexico—she said, “Of course you’d love that as a kid, that’s Art\\nDeco.” I said, “It never occurred to me, it never occurred to me.” So I go back and look at\\nphotographs of me as a kid and what I had in my room, in my bedroom. It was all geometric\\nstuff. I’ve responded to that. But my training as a potter came through looking at the history of\\nceramics.\\nSo when I found this village and I was, you know, in my fifties, I thought, I’m home, this is what\\nI want in my work. And I realized that when I was in college I took a lot of design classes from\\nKeith Malmquist, who was just an amazing design teacher. He was in his thirties. I took a lot of\\ndesign, I love design. But we were not encouraged to, when we were making pots, to bring in,\\nsay what we’re learning in sculpture or painting—it just was a different source. I realized three\\nyears ago that, Oh Keith, thank you. I have to find him. I found him, he was still alive, in\\nnorthern Minnesota. I called him up and said, “Keith, this is Jeff Oestreich.” He said, “I\\nremember you.” I said, “Keith, you were such a great teacher, I had such a crush on you.”\\nBut he just died and he’s buried in Scandia—about twenty minutes from here—because he has a\\nbrother in the cemetery. But I said, “Keith, tell me about your background. Where did you study\\nart?” So, “I taught high school art at Bemidji and then I went back to school, I went to Yale.”\\nAnd that was a long time ago—he studied with Joseph Albers from the Bauhaus. If you know\\nJoseph and Anni Albers? They were fundamental in the whole design/painting world, way back\\nwhen they taught at the Bauhaus in Germany. When Hitler got in power he closed that down so\\nthey all left the country, all the greats. Joseph and Anni moved to America, Lucie Rie moved to\\nLondon, they just got out of the country. These great people—and they closed down the\\nBauhaus. So Keith studied with one of the world’s greats, so that just all made sense, like, “Aw,\\nwhat a gift.” But I wanted to thank him, I said, “Thank you Keith.”\\n01:29:30\\nAW: So did you meet up with him? Or just talk to him over the phone?\\nJO: I was going up north and I called him and he wasn’t home. And then someone said that he\\nhad Alzheimer’s and then they moved him down here to Hudson and then he passed away. I\\nhaven’t been to his grave yet, but I go to Scandia a lot. I’m going to stop at the cemetery. Again,\\nit’s having these key people at the right time that open the door, and he’s on that short list of\\npeople, he was just so inspiring. He just loved design, he was really a good designer. He loved\\nteaching it. I remember acing those classes, I just ate it up.\\nAW: What was his last name?\\nJO: Malmquist—it’s a Swedish name, isn’t it?\\nBut, when I think of the teachers in my life, they all gave me something a bit different. Be it\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n26\\neither pure education or role modeling or whatever it might be. I feel just blessed with these\\npeople that came into my life. From my Aunt Judy, just all across the board here—and my dad\\ngave me the confidence to be able to make money, I mean to not worry about it because he\\nwasn’t a saver, if he had it he’d just blow it—go make some more. So I live on faith—and I’ll\\nhave to work until I’m dead, but that’s okay (laughs).\\nAW: Well speaking of working and making money—you left England and then you said you\\nmoved to Wisconsin. Did you get a business going right away? How did that all happen? Take us\\nback to those first years—\\nJO: Well, I came back in June of ‘71 and I came back to my parents because I had my studio still\\nthere, that my dad built me and this kiln. And so, the plan was to work a bit and save money then\\nbuy a place. So I started making pots right off the bat. When I came back Randy Johnston\\nwanted to work with me. So I said, “Sure, you can come work with me.” So we worked in this\\nlittle studio. So we said, “Let’s have a sale out here.” So we asked Warren MacKenzie if we\\ncould borrow his mailing list—how ballsy is that?! He said, “Sure.” And so we had this sale in\\nmy parents’ backyard, and people came to see it—we sold about six or seven hundred dollars\\nworth of pots. I thought, Wow, we have it made. Well, that didn’t last long. But it was this—\\nsaving up money and I could not find a farm to buy. So the one in Wisconsin, where the pottery\\nburned down, the guy said, “Well, you can buy the house on five or ten acres for ten thousand.” I\\nthought that was too much though—and so, I moved back to my parents’ and the plan was that—\\nI was just kind of heartbroken I lost the studio—but they had a benefits sale and we bought\\nanother wheel, and buy materials, etcetera. I thought, “I’m going to go to Japan and work with\\nHamada.” I’m going to go work with the other “great.” Why not? What the hell? I remember I\\nwrote Hamada, didn’t get a letter back, didn’t get it back. So I wrote my friend Shigeyoshi from\\nTamba. I had maybe three thousand dollars saved and he didn’t write back, didn’t write back, so\\nI just said to myself, “If I don’t hear from him by September 1st I’m going to take this three\\nthousand and I’m going to use it on a down-payment on a farm.” So anyway, the first rolled\\naround and he didn’t write, and I fell in love with my first love, Jerry. So I thought, “Crap, this is\\na mess.” So I thought, Well, it’s after the first, I think it’s the second. So I bought this place, and\\nthen he came up, and helped clean up this mess, and helped paint the walls. So I’ve been here for\\nforty years next month.\\nAW: Did you ever hear from Shigeyoshi?\\nJO: Yeah, I did. The second or third of September, and I thought, Well, crap. I said, “By the\\nfirst,” and I meant it. And then I fell in love with Jerry so I’m not going to go over there. And it’s\\na good thing I didn’t do that because John Bedding had some tough experiences there. Because\\nhe went to work with this traditional pottery place and it was just hard work.\\nSo, I bought this place and it was cheap: seventeen thousand, five hundred on five acres, I’ve\\nsince bought another forty acres but—I love this area. I didn’t know that it was close to St. Croix\\nFalls. When I moved up here it was really a very tight Swedish community, a hundred and\\ntwenty Swedes. And here’s me, moving up here, a German and a potter, that was weird to them.\\nAnd a gay guy, they didn’t know what to do with any of that. So I was an oddity. I got to know\\nthe first house coming in. It was an old, old retired farm couple who were in their eighties, they\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n27\\nkind of took me in and—Dudley and Sylvia Baruch. They were just lovely people. He just\\nalways had blue shirts all starched and the top button—and she had this flower dress on—they\\nwere just so sweet. They were lovely, lovely people. I was down there for dinner once and I just\\nsaid to Sylvia, I said, “Gosh Sylvia, I’ve been here for like five or ten years and I’m just an\\noutsider.” So, “I’m an outsider too.” I said, “Where’d you grow up?” She said, “I grew in\\nPalmdale, that’s five miles that way.” Exactly five miles on the way to TF [Taylor’s Falls]. All\\nher life, for like sixty years, she still thought of herself as being an outsider. I mean, that’s how\\ntight this community was with Swedes.\\nSo, some time went by and Jim Cordes wrote a book about Amador Township, our township.\\nAnd this is when I began to realize I’m accepted here now, is that the book came out and in the\\nvery back it had a listing of all the things that happened year by year. Like in 1904 they built the\\nchurch, 1910 it burned down—in 1974 it said, “Oestreich Pottery started.” I thought, What? This\\nis amazing. I think they were just hard up for news for that year, but I just felt validated then.\\nAnd then I came home fifteen years ago and I saw this sign, “Pottery Trail.” “Oh ick!” You see,\\nwhat happened—I was always Route 1 Box 104, how quaint. But what happened was that they\\nhad to name all the unnamed gravel roads because they’re hooking up to the GPS system then.\\nSo, a committee met in Almelund, a little tiny little town hall, and they had to go down the\\nalphabet, for these unnamed roads. “That one is ‘o,’ it’s Oriole.” This road had to begin with a\\n“P.” So someone said, this is second-hand, “Oh, there’s that potter living down there, let’s call it\\nPottery Trail.” And the next one over was “Q.” And I said that, “If this road had to begin with a\\n‘Q’ they’d call it ‘Queer Trail’ or ‘Queen Trail’” (laughs). So, that’s a big joke.\\nBut, you know, all those old Swedes have died, they’re gone, it’s all changed now. But when I\\nmoved up here, it was like moving up to—where in the hell is this little farm on the prairie? I\\nwas the first potter that moved out here. Then two years later Janel [Jacobson] moved out, so we\\nbecame friends right off the bat. And then Linda [Christianson] moved out, we became friends,\\nand then she worked here for a year. And then Bob [Briscoe] moved—well Connie [Mayeron]\\nmoved out, Bob moved out, Rick [Vincent] moved out, Guillermo [Cuellar] moved out. So we\\ncreated this cluster here of—but it’s odd how people assume that we’re all buddies, we hang out\\ntogether. We see each other just at the meetings twice a year. At one point we were, way back\\nwhen, we did spend a lot of time together, but people started having their kids and whatever. And\\nlife would be just changing, and so that part’s changed. But, in spirit we’re a community here.\\n01:38:10\\nJO: So tell me—I’ve never been in Rick’s. You were at Rick’s house today right? I’ve never\\neven been in his house.\\nI dropped something off and left it on the step once—about ten years ago. And yet we do feel\\nthis collective, we just feel something in that— I know that’s odd but—I’ve been in Bob’s house\\nonce, Linda’s house I’ve been in a lot, Janel’s a lot, way back, you know thirty years ago. But,\\nit’s just the meetings but we still—we’re known, this tour is known around the country. We’re\\nthe number one tour now. We’ve gotten so much exposure and so much—it’s grown into this\\nphenomena—it’s so bizarre.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n28\\nAW: What’s bizarre about it?\\nJO: The response. People come from around the world now, people fly in. And I think, Really?!\\nAnd now people beg, “Can we be a part of the Tour?” And we have to—we can’t—but everyone\\nthat I have as a guest here—I had a guest here who is a Director of the Archie Bray this year and\\nhe said, “These people here are so educated.” The people that come take the Tour they’re really\\nknowledgeable about pots, and that’s unique. And they keep coming back and you think that—\\nwe’re always worried that— Okay, let’s keep some figures here, to see how much we bring in, to\\nsee if it’s going downhill we have to think of different advertisement. I think this year we\\nprobably made, all told, maybe half a million. We were up to four-fifty [four hundred and fifty\\nthousand] last year, but now I think it’s probably gone up because it goes up fifty thousand a\\nyear. Isn’t that just—? In Minnesota, thanks to Warren, his golden years from the sixties, when I\\nwas there [at the University of Minnesota]—Randy Johnston went through, Michael Simon,\\nSandy Simon, this group of high energy people that went through the program there then settled\\nin this area and then just kind of got things going. And the [Northern] Clay Center started twenty\\nyears ago, we got this going, and so, now we’re—we’re known.\\nI call this the “Mashiko of America.” Mashiko is a very famous village in Japan that’s all potters;\\nit’s a couple hours from Tokyo. There’s maybe a hundred potters in this village it’s all potters,\\nit’s renowned. I call this the “Mashiko of America” because there’s this density of potters in\\nMinnesota now and in Wisconsin. I have some theories of why this has all happened. I think one\\nof them is the kind of pots that are made here, the type of pots, they’re not the type of pots that fit\\ninto a home in, say California or New Mexico. They’re pots that speak of rich wood interiors,\\nlike this house. They’re just pots that just seem to fit in our interiors. So we spend a lot of time\\non the interiors, we pay a lot of attention to the inside of our houses. They just add the warmth to\\nthis space. I think that’s a part of it. And we’re Germans, and we’re Swedes, and they’re just—\\nthey’re makers. So we’ve got appreciation built in right there. We also have good public support,\\nwe have good grants. There's just an awareness of the arts in Minnesota. So we’ve got those\\nthings going for us. Yeah, it’s so strange—that phenomena—\\nOne thing—just to add this—when I started making pots at Bemidji State, there was maybe one\\npot in ten thousand households, really. And now there’s a handmade pot in everyone’s\\nhousehold. Either their kid made it at a camp, or they made it in high school, they got it as a\\nwedding present, or their kid took a class, there’s references on TV, “Oh, I’m going to take my\\npottery class.” Oprah was on a wheel last year, I saw her on a potter’s wheel. And Martha\\nStewart has her Jonathan Adler guy. So it’s just this common language now—pottery. And\\nwe’ve all seen a pot being made on a wheel. But back in the sixties it was so bizarre. And\\nWarren, he had to educate way back when, in the fifties—he would talk a department store into\\nletting him put his wheel in the show window of the department—people would walk by on the\\nsidewalk, “What is that guy doing?!” There are high school programs now that are far superior\\nthan the ones I had in college, and they’re just amazing.\\nAW: So, when did you graduate high school again?\\nJO: Nineteen sixty-five.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n29\\nAW: Then you graduated from Bemidji in—?\\nJO: Nineteen sixty-nine.\\nAW: And you went to White Bear Lake High School?\\nJO: Correct. And that was great, they had a really good art program there. Good theater program.\\nBut Bemidji—this is just heartbreaking—they have canned their whole theater program. They’re\\ndown to two on the art faculty. They’re going to can that program. It’s turning into more of a\\ntechnical college. And how these instructors work so hard to build it up to what it was—ugh,\\nthat’s distressing.\\nAW: When you were in high school—or at Bemidji too—did you have many friends or\\ncolleagues who were interested in pottery, who were going to pursue it? You were saying it was\\nan unusual thing to do.\\nJO: A couple, sure.\\nAW: —but there seem to be some good teachers there so were there other students then?\\nJO: Right, there was another potter who left, and he made pots for a number of years, and then he\\nmoved into real estate—no, to insurance. We’ve reconnected now. He’s trying to sell his Leach\\nwheel and some kiln shelves. He’s moving down south to Phoenix.\\nAW: Anybody else from those times that you still are in contact with? Or was it mainly the\\nteachers that you--?\\nJO: The teachers—a fellow student married my sister. That’s about it from that era. It seems a\\nlong time ago and the University [of Minnesota], I’ve kept in touch with some students there.\\nRandy Johnston, we grew up on White Bear Lake, so I’ve always known him, and Mark Pharis, I\\nsee once a year; Wayne Branum, I see once a year. I see Warren and Nancy. Sandy Simon,\\nMichael Simon, I see on occasion.\\n01:45:25\\nAW: When did you first meet Warren?\\nJO: When he came up to Bemidji for the workshop in 1965, that first semester. Actually it was a\\nquarter system, he came up with John Reeve. And I was working for the art department. At that\\ntime we bought clay already premade in a box at the bookstore. And also, our glazes for the\\nclass, we mix them up from powder. We bought premixed glazes from the clay company, and we\\njust added water to the glazes and stirred it up—they had like five glazes. So Warren came up\\nthere, and John, and I just remember their tables were just full of pots. They were just so fast—I\\nwas just like mesmerized. John Reeve just spent the whole time just making pitchers, and they\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n30\\nwere just lively and spirited and he put the handles upside down. I thought, “How can I do that?”\\nSo we’d run over to the bookstore and get some more clay. They used up all the clay in the\\nbookstore—they just ripped through it. And that’s when I thought, “Wow.” I was even more in\\nlove.\\nAnd then at the University of Minnesota, when I transferred, I remember going over to Warren’s\\nhouse for a gathering. Into his house—and this house is just full of pots and beautiful furniture—\\nand I was just kind of taken by it. It was the first kind of potter’s house I’d been in to. Thinking,\\nWow, this is real amazing. I just remember that. And he’s speaking at the White Bear Arts\\nCenter, and I’ve been asked to come and speak a little bit about Warren, and was just thinking\\nwhat to talk about. I’ll talk about that first time walking into his house, the impression it left on\\nme. He had maple floors and there was one board that was warped like this and there was a bolt\\nholding it down there. I remember that hump on the floor for years! And the Swedish blue paint\\nbehind the sink, and all this. And of course I had that color too when I bought my first house.\\nThat left such an impression, the warmth of that house, and the beautiful pie safes, and dry sinks.\\nI just remember the furniture—I was in awe of how rich it was—and his studio—and that\\naffected me. And the amount of pots that he makes when he’s making, he’s just—puts us all to\\nshame, he just makes hundreds and hundreds. And his kiln is huge, he used to fire it once a\\nmonth. Last year he said, “Oh I’ve slowed down, I only fire it now every six weeks.” And I\\nthink, (gasp) What? And he gets down there and he doesn’t tidy up or anything he just gets right\\nto it. I just fiddle around, I do this, and then I kind of have to ease into it. It takes hours, then I’m\\ninto gear. But he just gets down, and he’s just so disciplined. He’s got a making list. But the\\nsecret of it is that Nancy, she does the shopping, the cleaning, a lot of the cooking. I remember\\nonce when he had to have shoulder surgery and Nancy said, “you just drive me nuts.” He’d be\\nleaning over, she’s making bread—so she couldn’t wait for him to get back to work because\\nwhen he gets to work he’s really the happiest. So she provides a stage for him to keep working—\\nthat’s when he’s happiest.\\nAW: Yeah, that seems to be the case with the partnerships here—one person helps behind the\\nscenes.\\nJO: I’m so envious.\\nAW: You are?\\nJO: I could get on my little pity thing, Oh, I have to do the cooking, cleaning, and I have to cut\\nthe grass, and repair the house, and then have to make the work, and a living—I’m the only one\\nof them that’s single—and then I get over it. Honestly I can’t wait until I’m in the nursing home\\n(laughs).\\nI say that I’m overwhelmed with house repairs, so I say, “I can’t wait ‘til I’m in the nursing\\nhome, so I won’t have to think about another project. I won’t have to think about a new pot\\nshape.” One thing that I need to do is—I feel compelled to come up with new ideas, more ideas.\\nThat takes a lot of work, and it’s exhausting. By the end of the day I’m just wiped out. I don’t\\nknow where that came from because it wasn’t taught. You weren’t told that you have to come up\\nwith new things. We were doing production-ware in England. So, it’s just this inner need to\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n31\\nprovide that for the people, to challenge myself. So I often say, “I can’t wait to get into that\\nnursing home. Then I won’t have to think of another pottery glaze or shape.” (Laughs)\\n01:50:45\\nAW: So, is Warren still actively producing then?\\nJO: Um hmm.\\nAW: I thought he had kind of retired in a way, but he’s still very active?\\nJO: Yeah, he’s remarkable.\\nAW: So, where do you get your ideas? What are your inspirations for the pots that you make?\\nJO: It’s all over the map now, it’s not so much history. In fact when I go to a museum I hardly\\never go look at the pots, I go look at other things. But I’ve got a massive library of pottery books\\nand I hardly ever open them up. What I get ideas from is often the pot before or just looking,\\nbeing observant. And, for instance, Art Deco is a major thing, but then when I was glazing and\\ndecorating last month, I took—well, I had some shoe polish out in the studio and I love the cap\\nof it, this beautiful shape, so I use that as a pattern. I cut around it and made stencils. And I\\nthought, “Hmm. And a deodorant top has this wonderful oval, so I took that out there and was\\nusing that as a shape to kind of press in. So, ideas come from just anywhere. It’s a rich world out\\nthere. And then I’ve been doing pots that have—do you remember the scales? (Laughs) Like G\\nsharp—I’d do a G sharp, I made the sharp thing [#] and on the back it says like two sharps, the\\nscale of G has two sharps right? Yeah.\\nAnd then I worked on a series called, “What Cup Size Are You?” because Jackie and I—she\\ncalled me up one day and said, “Now, we’re going to go camping with my daughter and her\\nhusband.” And I said, “Jackie, you know we don’t camp.” “Well, that’s why I have a hotel for us\\ndown the road.” (Laughs) We couldn’t get the damn fire going so, “Jackie, let’s go to the hotel.”\\nSo, we got to go to the hotel and we were freezing so we went to the hot tub. And we were\\nsharing the same room and she said, “I’m going to take a shower,” so she left her bra on the bed.\\nAnd so, I like to play little pranks on people. So I took two of the hotel cups and I put them\\nunderneath the bra, and she came out and said, “what are you doing?” I said, “I want to find out\\nwhat cup size you were.” So, I did this whole series of cups that go, “A,” “B,” “C,” “D” around\\nit. So that was the inspiration for that.\\nTM: That’s clever (laughs).\\nAW: Yeah (laughs).\\nJO: I know it’s kind of corny, it’s corny, but I was taught in this very rigid dogmatic school of\\nthought—and it’s just recent that, I’m sick of this, I want to have fun with the work so I did it—\\nI’m nuts about Downton Abbey. Have you watched it?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n32\\nAW: Yeah.\\nJO: (Sigh) Oh, I have Downton Abbey books. I’ve had Downton Abbey dinner parties. I’ve\\nwatched each one four times. I know all the characters. I’m just crazy about that show. So I have\\na series now called, “Downton Abbey Quiz Cups.” In the front I put a “D” and “A” for Downton\\nAbbey, then in back of it I put initials, of one of the thirty-three characters, and then like “VC”\\nfor instance, “Violet Crawley.” And then in the bottom I put a number, and if you can’t guess it\\nthen you call me up and I’ll charge you five dollars to give you the answer (laughs).\\nI’m just having fun with this stuff now, just having some fun. And that happened—Clary Illian,\\nwho is also Leach trained, in Iowa—her work has changed, and she’s decorating with faces on\\nher pots. That kind of fun stuff and she said in this video that, “I just want to have fun with the\\nwork now.” And I called up Clary and, “Clary, I know what you mean, this whole Leach thing,\\nit’s just dogmatic—oh my god—I want to have fun too.” So I just began to lighten up and do\\nsome corny stuff that—Leach would probably roll over in his grave if he saw it, but it’s just\\nabout time. Just to lighten up a bit.\\n01:54:55\\nAW: When you first started your business or when you first started making pots as a career, were\\nyou just following what you had learned?\\nJO: Interesting, haven’t talked about this yet. I didn’t know how I was going to make a living.\\nMy dad, I remember my dad was trained in business, he showed me how to do a balance sheet\\nwith the columns—you know, entry, double entry, that thing.\\nWell, I tried Quicken for a while, I gave up and went back to my old thirteen columns across and\\nthen you write in like “To Walmart,” and then you go to the column and you put that income\\nexpense, and write what the expense was about, if it’s postage, or shipping, or clay materials, or\\nheating, whatever you put—and anyway, he showed me how to do that. He showed me how to\\nbalance a checkbook because I didn’t write in a checkbook until I was twenty-three, I didn’t\\nbalance a checkbook. So business stuff, he kind of coached me along. Then he called me up and\\nsaid, “I’ve got a good idea, you can make some of these Lazy Susans.” And I said, “Dad, shut\\nup, let me make what I want to make.” He was just buggin’ me with ideas. So he got me in that\\nkind of business. Also, when I came back from England, I asked my dad—my dad would loan\\nout money to his children right and left, ‘til about the day he died. But I never went to my dad for\\nmoney because I was really independent—I got to do it on my own. He’d always say, “You can\\ngo up to that coffee can and just take some money out of there if you need something.” I said,\\n“Dad could you loan me some money for a clay mixer?” He said, “No.” And I was so upset, so\\nhurt. He was bailing my brother out of businesses. He said, “Because you have to develop a\\ncredit history, I’ll go to the bank and I’ll cosign on the loan.” So we marched over to North St.\\nPaul, the bank—and I was just twenty-three—I remember that, just going over there with him,\\nand sitting down with the president, or the guy who ran the bank, and borrowed I think a\\nthousand dollars for this clay mixer and dad cosigned. I paid every month; I paid the bank and\\nfinally paid it off. That was the best lesson from him, to be independent financially. That was a\\ngood lesson. “Thanks, Dad.”\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n33\\nI decided to model it after the Leach Pottery. I was going to spend so many hours doing\\nfunctional ware, production ware, all the kind of [unclear], as we did in England. And half the\\ntime doing one-of-a-kind pieces. So I had a catalog published and, Okay, this is what I’m going\\nto do now. I had the catalog and this basket of samples and I went around to all these craft shops\\nin Minnesota, and no one bought anything. No one ordered anything except a place on Arcade in\\nSt. Paul, but they never paid me for them. So the whole thing just fizzled.\\nThen I thought, I’ll make tiles. The Leach Pottery made tiles during the First World War, Second\\nWorld War, to survive. I thought, I’ll make tiles, then I can train someone else to do it. So I\\nfigured out how to make tiles and I had a catalog printed and I was going to send those off to all\\nthe interior designers and decorators in the state, and I had lists of those. I never sent them out. I\\nguess I got a check from a gallery or something and just canned that whole idea. Oh, I know\\nwhy! I made tiles for the kitchen and the bathroom and then I made tiles for a friend’s floor, I\\nmade a thousand tiles. I thought, Ick, I hate this, this is boring. So I just skipped that.\\nWhat the Leach Pottery did—when he started that place in 1920—is that he had raku Sundays,\\nwhere he would build a raku kiln and he’d make the pots and he would bisque them, and then\\npeople could come and just decorate them—pot them, and bingo! That’s how he would educate\\npeople. So, I tried that, put up posters in town. Only one person showed up. It was Gary, my\\nfriend from high school with his two kids. So there was no interest in that, no interest in tiles, no\\ninterest in the production ware. Everything just flopped. It was all a blessing in disguise; I could\\njust make what I want to make now, and that’s just who I am.\\nSo, you know, I was trying to force these things on that my heart was only half way—but I did\\ndo commissions for years, on a dinnerware set or something. But I stopped doing that when I\\nturned fifty. No more commissions because they always bomb out. I’m going off to teach\\ntableware next week, and thinking—Oh boy, I gotta story—\\nWhen I was first up here, Mike Maguire bought a building in Stillwater. It was a restaurant\\nopening up—in this brick—it wasn’t The Dock, it was another building. And he redesigned it\\nand it was a restaurant and they wanted handmade pots, so the owner of the restaurant came up\\nwith the chef and said, “We need two hundred and fifty place settings.” I said, “Sure,” and I gave\\nhim a rock bottom price because I was starving. And he brought up a stainless steel cover that\\nyou put on plates to keep the food warm before it’s buzzed out. He said, “The plates have to fit\\nunderneath that.” So I took a stack of plates out of the cupboard and they fit perfectly. So I just\\nmade two hundred and fifty plates. The whole kiln was solid plates, I had five hundred plates in\\nthe kiln, big and small plates. I had to borrow shelves from people—I had a shelf every two\\ninches. I had a big walk-in kiln then. So I unstacked the kiln and I checked the lid and the lid\\ndidn’t fit. All the plates were about a quarter inch too big. And I thought, Awww. What\\nhappened was my clay—I was adding more sand in my clay for texture and it wasn’t shrinking\\nenough. I didn’t know that. So I had to make all the plates over again. I thought, Oh god. And\\nthen what happened was that people were stealing plates and cups from the restaurant, so they\\nhave to order more. So I had to build a small kiln just so I could process those and remake some\\nmore. It was just getting to be too much. And then the demise of the project was the chef ran off\\nwith the owner’s wife and they just closed the restaurant, and they threw all the pots in the\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n34\\ndumpster. Oh, thank god. (wipes hands) Then about a week later, I remember I was at my\\nparents’ house, someone tracked me down, this Japanese guy, said, “I’m opening up a Japanese\\nrestaurant, would you make six hundred covered rice bowls?” (Gasp) I said, “No thank you.”\\nI was trying to model my place after the Leach Pottery, which just wasn’t, it just didn’t work. I\\ndidn’t have any role models.\\n02:01:50\\nAW: How did the production ware sell?\\nJO: No one ordered any of it, just didn’t. And I realize too, that it was too early in my—I needed\\nmore time to get things developed and mature as a potter. I was just not mature as a potter. So, it\\nwas just bad timing—and that system, that’s great, say if you had an apprentice that you can train\\nto make that, you can guide them along as a teaching tool. But I’m not a teacher. So my income\\ncame from people that dropped in daily. I had a big sign out on 95 [Minnesota highway] that\\nsaid, “Showroom Open.” It was a big eight by ten sign out there with an arrow. And people\\nwould stop by out of curiosity here, this was like forty years ago, they’d think, Oh what is this?\\nSo I’d take them through the pottery and I’d make a cup on the wheel, then take them in the\\nhouse and have coffee with them, and show them, “Now you choose your own cup,” and take\\nthem through and educate them. By the end of the day I was just so wired up from coffee. And\\nthen I finally took the sign down because I was getting people in that, just curiosity. By that time\\nit had built up to people who were knowledgeable would stop in. So I’ve always had a showroom\\non-site and people would just stop in. There’s a basket—they just leave money because it’s self-service.\\nThat’s the MacKenzie whole thing—just leave a check out there or something.\\nThe tour now has kind of overtaken the daily—not a lot of daily drop-ins anymore, people wait\\nuntil we have the Tour. It’s a big event. I wish there were more daily drop-ins because it’s hard\\nto educate people and talk when there are a thousand people here. My goal is to be able to sell it\\nall from the showroom. It’s never going to happen. I’ll always need galleries. They provide a\\ncertain function, and then the Tour provides a function, and the daily drop-ins too, people do\\nstop. I need that.\\nI remember that Janet Leach told me that, “We’re training people here to be potters, not\\nteachers.” And so, maybe ten years went by, after I came back, and I got a call to come and teach\\nat a school in Memphis. I was feeling isolated then, and I thought, Oh really? I’d love to do that.\\nSo I moved down to Memphis for six months. I love teaching, but I still had this in the back of\\nmy head, this voice, “Oh, you’re betraying your cause, you should be a potter,” that purist thing.\\nI liked it, so then I spent about ten years going around to various universities and teaching first\\nsemester here, a year there, all over the country. I loved it! Then I was just thinking, No. I needed\\nmore time to work, I needed solitude, privacy—and when you teach full-time you give yourself\\nover to it. I applied for MacKenzie’s job when he retired and I didn’t get it. They were down to\\ntwo people and I didn’t get it. Thank God I didn’t get it, it would’ve ruined me—blessing in\\ndisguise. I was getting towards the end of the teaching, so I thought, I’ll teach at the best—so I\\ntaught at RISD [Rhode Island School of Design] in Rhode Island. It’s just one of the best art\\nschools in the country. They called me up and said, “Would you teach?” “Sure.” I didn’t like it. I\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n35\\ndidn’t really like it. I thought, This is over, it’s not—teaching is not—I’m not made for it as a\\ncareer. But I love teaching weekend workshops, it’s love ‘em and leave ‘em. I whip in for a\\ncouple of days and tsch tsch, get them all charged up. I do a couple, usually weeklong classes,\\nI’ll do that—weeklong class. And that’s fine, but long-term, grades and all that, committee\\nmeetings, and (groan). It’s not it for me. There are people that are far better at it, who really need\\nthe income. So I feel just honored that I—every check that I get, I’m just so, “Oh thank you,\\nthank you for supporting me.” It’s just—I’m so grateful.\\n02:06:08\\nAW: So you were a teacher—this was the mid to late seventies that you were doing some of\\nthese teaching things?\\nJO: Late seventies through the eighties. Then I thought, This isn’t going to cut it. Then in ‘91, I\\nthink it was my last year of teaching, ‘91 or ‘92, I was teaching in New York, at Alfred, New\\nYork, and then Rhode Island, and just realized “No.” It’s not my calling.\\nAW: And then would you come back here to—? So you had this place the whole time? You were\\njust going off and traveling—?\\nJO: Yep, renting an apartment, rent a house—close this place up. It’s odd how it’s all worked out\\nthe way it’s supposed to have worked out, I think.\\nAlso, when I was teaching at these great art schools, teaching alongside people who had been\\nteaching all their life, it was just in their blood. It wasn’t in my blood.\\nAW: So at the same time though, you were developing your own type of pottery, the pottery you\\nwanted to do. How would you describe that? Can you tell us a little bit more about the type of\\nclay, the glazes you were using, and things like that?\\nJO: When I look back I go through these decades. The first decade was I did gas reduction firing\\nin a big gas kiln. And then, at that tenth year, I was invited to teach at the Kansas City Art\\nInstitute—a great school—and they had a wood kiln, so I fell in love with wood. So I came back\\nhere and I ripped down the gas kiln and built a wood kiln. And then ten years of that, then Alfred\\ncalled me, “Will you please come and teach for a semester?” I said, “Why not?” I get there and I\\nwas teaching a lot of students, and they had, gosh, they had maybe twenty-five kilns there. And\\nthey had a kiln—it’s a soda kiln--and I fell in love with that soda process. They were doing\\noxidation soda, which was really odd, but you’ve got this range of colors—I just love the colors.\\nI had a student, Nicholas Seidner, was in the class, it was a sophomore class, and I wanted to do\\nthis big, huge celadon-testing extravaganza. So I got a hundred and fifty celadon formulas and\\neach student got ten of them. And Nicholas, I gave him ten or a dozen, I said, “’Okay, test these\\nin gas reduction, soda oxidation, wood firing, and something else.” So we had fifteen hundred\\ntiles out on the table. This amazing range of celadons—it was so cool. There was one glaze I got\\nfrom Helene, who spent the summer at the Leach Pottery. All celadons have a little bit of iron in\\nthem to give them that jade color. This one didn’t; it had a little bit of copper. So I said, “That’s\\nnot going to work.” But I said, “Nicholas, run it through anyway, we’ll just see.” And this glaze\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n36\\ncame out of the soda kiln, this beautiful turquoise gray. I just thought, Oh my, it’s so gorgeous.\\nSo I name it—the glaze—“Nick’s Misfire.” And you’ll see that glaze in buckets around the\\ncountry. So that’s the history of “Nick’s Misfire.” And you see that glaze, you type it in there—\\nso that’s how it got going, so I named it after Nicholas Seidner. I haven’t seen him since. But I’m\\nteaching a class in Italy next summer and they love oxidation soda. I said, “Let’s get Nick to\\ncome to be—,” but there wasn’t enough time to do that. But anyway, so I came back from\\nAlfred, ripped down my wood kiln and built a soda kiln, just for that glaze. I could never get it.\\nNext kiln, couldn’t get it, third kiln, couldn’t get it—could never get that glaze. My kilns\\nnaturally reduce a little bit. So I’ve never been able to get that here.\\nIt was at that time, when I was switching to soda, I didn’t quite know where I was going to—\\nwhat I wanted to do with it, other than that one glaze. I was traveling in New Zealand, and I was\\nthere—I got an award, so they flew me over. We did some traveling around the country and one\\nday I walked into this village on the north island, Napier. And Napier, in 1928, was destroyed by\\nthis massive earthquake; all the commercial buildings, a hundred of them, were just were\\ndemolished. So they rebuilt all the buildings in the Art Deco style because they were poured\\nconcrete, they were earthquake proof, they were kind of the rage at the time, and they were\\ninexpensive. They were basically concrete that they put all this “icing” on it, all these colors and\\ndetail, just fluff it all up. And I walked in and I said, “Oh,” (sigh), this is what I’ve been looking\\nfor.” Art Deco (gasp) design classes at Bemidji State, it’s all just strict design. I thought, It’s just\\npure design. I thought (gasp), This is it! This is what I’ve been looking for. That coupled with a\\ndiscovery of the arts and crafts movement, the tiles that were made in the twenties and thirties, a\\nbeautiful range of matte glazes from Pewabic, Roseville, Rookwood, all those potters doing that\\nsame kind of matte. I just thought, I love these glazes! But I was trained on celadons, khakis,\\ntenmokus, shinos, and so to switch over to that was a leap. It kind of fit where my work was\\ngoing shape-wise, it just kind of fit in with that. Now if I take a shino glaze on my pots now, it\\ndoesn’t look right. They don’t fit.\\nSo my work is a lot of geometry, but I’ve been missing what I fell in love with in clay was the\\nround, organic forms, all about curves. I’m missing that fullness and that—I’m missing it. I can’t\\ngo back there because my work is faceted, and this, and that, and the other. But I’ve been kind of\\nsneaking up on it in the last series I was doing—some oval things and trying to find some\\npatterns that are more organic. I don’t know where it’s going to go, what’s going to come out of\\nit, but—.\\nThe work I’ve been doing lately, that is more personal than any work I’ve ever done, is when I\\nhad those pianos rebuilt, I got all the bass strings. I’m nuts about copper, I’ve always loved\\ncopper. And my pottery, the main work area, I finally finished it. I wanted it to be a really\\nbeautiful space, so it’s all cherry paneling and there’s copper—I made cabinets for all my tools, I\\nmade copper fronts on them. So I can draw on them with white pencil, so I can just erase it.\\nThey’re drawing boards yet they’re copper. I’ve put copper trim on the edges and I have copper\\nwall plates, and I just love copper. So I said, “What can I do with these bass strings?” So I did a\\nseries of covered forms and I make a copper loop handle for it, I bend it and I wrap it with silver\\naround that.\\nSo I took one of the bass strings, I wound it in between the copper wire—I got silver—and then I\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n37\\nmade tea caddies. That’s with the copper wire there, it’s hard to see in the dark here. So I called\\nthem “Audreanna Tea Caddies Mason Hamlin,” because this piano is named Audreanna, that’s\\nGerald. So they’re called “Audreanna Tea Caddies Mason Hamlin,” that’s the brand. And that\\none, I got the tuning pins from that—I use the tuning pins, I cut them in half, and set those in\\nthere for the knobs on those. And that’s how I honor my parents, because the pianos are named\\nin their honor. So that’s the work to me that’s got that story, which is the most personal. And I’m\\njust having a great time working on this idea.\\n02:15:00\\nAW: Yeah, you have this story now with each piece that can be told. I remember from the very\\nbeginning of the interview you were saying, you know, “love of objects” and the stories that they\\ntell.\\nJO: You know, that love of objects is, I know there’ll be a time when I have to send things\\ndown—say when I have to head off to the “home”—I can’t imagine saying good-bye to these\\nthings. I just love things. I love objects—I like to devour them and have them. I wish it would\\nease up a bit, but it hasn’t now because the spaces are full. But still you see something out there,\\na beautiful fabric or something—like, I’m a closet knitter. This is my knitting right here.\\nAW: Oh yeah?\\nJO: I love yarn! I just started five years ago. I have just boxes and boxes of yarn upstairs. I just\\nlove materials. That’s central to it all, I love materials, be it clay, that [yarn]—And when I was in\\nSouth Africa teaching I brought back a whole suitcase full of shway-shway material and I tried to\\nlearn to sew. That was a disaster, but I just love material. I love just touch, the feel—I just love\\nmaterials [opens bag]. This is a Japanese yarn—I just do scarves—it’s got some silk in it.\\nAW: Oh, that’s so gorgeous. Yeah, knitting—I find it very soothing.\\nJO: It is, and it boosts the serotonin in your brain. I really love the whole history of knitting. But\\nnow there’s so many great yarns out there. You go into a yarn shop and, “I don’t need any more\\nyarn, I’ve got enough to last for three lifetimes.” Like, “Oh, isn’t that beautiful?” You just want\\nto have it. My mom, she sewed all the time, she had a bumper sticker that said, “The one that\\ndies with the most fabric wins.” (laughs).\\nAW: (Laughter) That’s right, you were saying—so, your mom was a pianist, a professional\\npianist, and then she stopped?\\nJO: Yeah, she was trained and she stopped to raise her kids, she never went back.\\nAW: Were there other crafts that she did?\\nJO: She sewed all the time, and knit. She knit until almost the day she died, the same scarf over\\nand over and over again—this cool little design. I think it’s from childhood, “Don’t just sit\\naround, do something.” So we were always doing something while we were watching TV, just\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n38\\nmaking stuff. I found out when I was researching my mom’s background that—where did mom,\\nwhere did her love of sewing come from? When she was born—I found a letter in her desk when\\nI cleaned out her desk about her background—that she—you know her mother died in childbirth.\\nSo the baby was just handed to her grandmother, “Please raise her.” So my grandmother raised\\nmy mom. I found in a census records, when I was researching, that my great-grandmother, she\\nwas a seamstress, that’s how she made a living to raise my mom. And so that’s where my mom\\nlearned to sew. And mom would make my dad’s suits; she made all the drapes and curtains in the\\nhouse. She just was sewing—my sisters—they were sewing all the time. The dining room table\\nas a kid—they were always cutting patterns out on that. And there was always an ironing board\\nthere with a ham on it. You know what a ham is? It’s for sewing, for ironing. It looks like a ham,\\nbut it’s stuffed with material and then it’s felting on the outside, for ironing cuffs and sleeves and\\nsmaller parts. So there were all of these patterns around and I loved watching them and I loved\\npatterns. And my love of pattern, I’m certain, comes from these patterns they were always\\nworking with.\\nAW: And your grandmother’s name was Blanche?\\nJO: Um hmm.\\nAW: What were your parent’s names again?\\nJO: Audreanna and Gerald.\\nAW: You named the pianos after each of your parents?\\nJO: Yep, some people name their grand pianos after their—they have names for them. So that’s\\nGerald, and that’s my dad’s high school picture on that one. And this—Audreanna—and her high\\nschool picture’s on that one, and then a little sealed container. There are some of her ashes in\\nthere; I have it sealed up.\\n02:20:22\\nAW: And it was Audreanna’s family that had some Swedish background?\\nJO: Yeah, she’s Swedish. And how her name came about: I found this one letter that told about\\nher background. This letter was written about 1940. She wrote a relative, “Tell me more about\\nmy background.” She didn’t know, so the story got told. We won’t go into much of it now, but\\nso when my grandmother died in childbirth, she just—they took the two grandmothers’ names\\nand combined it. “Audrey” and “Anna” became “Audreanna.”\\nAW: So you really have Swedish and German background?\\nJO: Yeah, some Norwegian and a little Welsh in there. But mom was very elegant, tall, lithe,\\nwell educated, very gracious, and she had this sense of style and I don’t know where that came\\nfrom. She’d spend the summers with my grandfather and his second wife, Lillian, and then go\\nback to this small, rural town during the school year. She was kind of shuttled back and forth,\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n39\\nwhich wasn’t an easy situation. I found out because there was a lot of jealousy between my\\ngreat-grandmother and my grandmother. So my mom had this life in this small, little farming\\ntown, in a little, tiny house that she was raised in, and then she’d go to my grandfather’s house—\\nhe was a wealthy doctor with a second wife—so there were these two worlds and it was very\\ndifficult.\\nSo, my grandfather’s second wife, I remember her. She and Fred came to visit us in White Bear\\nLake in 1958. From there they drove to California to visit their son, they had just one son—and\\nhis partner, he was gay—way back when. And they’re pulling into the driveway—because I\\nfound the article—they were pulling into the driveway and a car hit them broadside and she was\\nthrown from the car and she died right there, and her son witnessed the accident. So, I was in\\nL.A. a couple months ago and I said, “I have to go to this house.” So it took me days to find it on\\nthe internet. I went through city directories from ‘58, I was finally able to find the house. So,\\nthat’s where my [step] grandmother—that’s where she died. So I had to go there to honor her.\\nAnd so my grandfather then, he lost his will to live and he came to live with us, and he died in\\n’59.\\nAW: Oh, that’s so hard—\\nJO: So, both his wives he lost—\\nAW: In really tragic ways—\\nJO: Yeah, sad.\\nAW: And you’re father’s family, did you know them as well?\\nJO: Yes, that’s from the Iron Range—\\nAW: Yeah, the Iron Range, yeah—\\nJO: Yep.\\nAW: Wow—sorry, one other follow-up. Your siblings and their names?\\nJO: My oldest brother is Chip—\\nAW: Yeah, and what do they do?\\nJO: Chip, he’s retired, he worked for Quest. Well he was trained as a pilot, but then got off into\\nother jobs and the last bit of his career was working for Quest. And he bought the land right next\\nto the family cabin—came up for sale, so his heart’s there. And I can understand him being there,\\nit’s full of memories. And my next brother, that’s Mike, and his degree was from Macalester in\\npolitical science, he’s a plumber now. It’s like none of them—they’re just in different careers\\nnow. Linda, she—I can’t remember what her field was in college, but she worked for the phone\\ncompany for years and years. She’s working for St. John’s as a nursing staff, she’s sixty-five.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n40\\nDeanna, she’s teaching Spanish. Nancy is a social worker—trained in the flute, but then went\\ninto social work. So none of them really did what they studied. None of them really kind of\\npursued—they got off on these other tangents.\\n02:25:00\\nAW: You were saying when growing up, everybody had some kind of craft they did most of the\\ntime.\\nJO: They did—The house was full of music too. Piano, organ lessons, drums going, and\\nclarinets—it was just mom felt we all had to study this and we all did.\\nAW: But it sounds like you’re the only one who pursued a career in the arts.\\nJO: Um hm—but in this chaotic family I wanted to escape, so I would gravitate toward solitary\\nactivities. I’d go off and paint, I’d take my bike, I’d just really needed solitude. Even to this day I\\nneed—I have to balance this out of solitude and people. Like I’ve been feeling cut off lately. I\\nguess I’ve never felt lonely, but I’ve been feeling lonely since we had the Tour here. And I’ve\\nnever felt lonely; I have to identify this. I just feel something. So I can’t wait to get off and teach.\\nI think I’m entering another phase in my evolution as a person. Just another decade or something,\\nthere’s something else is happening in my thought and I need to be around more people. This is a\\nnew deal for me. Then I thought, Did I make the right choice living out here? But this place has\\nbeen built for making work, which I’ll always be doing.\\nAW: Well, speaking of people; let’s get into the Tour a bit more. So you said you moved out\\nhere and shortly after some of the other potters moved out here. How did you get to know each\\nother?\\nJO: Janel was the first person who moved up here and I think she heard there was another potter\\nin the area and she just stopped by. Also, there was the Minnesota Craft Council, which has\\ndisbanded since then, and I headed up the membership committee, so I’d get Linda and Janel\\nover here and we’d work on our membership stuff. So that was kind of a link there, too. Linda\\nmoved up, maybe a couple years after that, and she knocked on the door, “Can I work here?” She\\nworked here for about a year, then she bought a place.\\nAW: How was that? What was that like to have someone here all year round?\\nJO: It was good. Pat was the first one that knocked on the door in 1975, in January. She’s my\\noldest friend, we were always in contact and she shows here with the Tour and I go out there and\\nshow at her place. We’re going to England to work together at the Leach Pottery—that’s Pat, my\\noldest friend (points to photograph). So there have been about twenty people who have worked\\nhere in the studio over the years on and off. But now, I sold my extra wheels and closed “clay\\ncamp.” I mean now it’s just down to one person in a private studio and that’s probably how it\\nwill be.\\nAW: Tell us about the “clay camp” again?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nJ. Oestreich\\n06/09/14\\n41\\nJO: I’d be off in the world and I’d meet people, and I thought, Oh, why don’t you come here and\\nwork? And so that worked out because we had the Tour, and that was established so they could\\nfly over here one year ahead.

Can you tell us a little bit about where you were born and where you grew up?\\nJJ: I was born in Minneapolis and shortly after I was born we moved to Alaska because my\\nfather was in the service. He was a flight surgeon. We moved back to Minneapolis and we spent\\nsome years there and some years in Rochester [Minnesota], following dad for specialty medical\\ntraining. Then we moved back up to Golden Valley [Minnesota], where he joined a specialty\\npractice. Mom was the person who was most prominent in our lives and she made sure that we\\nhad good time outdoors. We went up to the North Shore and took nature walks and rock hunting,\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n2\\ntouching trees and feeling things. On rainy days we had little art projects we’d do at home among\\nother things, but mom was a good guide for us in our younger years.\\nAW: And when were you born?\\nJJ: 1950.\\nAW: Any siblings?\\nJJ: Siblings? I have an older sister and a younger brother and a younger sister.\\nAW: When you started to go to school, were you in Alaska or in Minneapolis?\\nJJ: We moved away from Alaska before I had real memories, maybe two years of age. I started\\ngoing to school when we lived in South Minneapolis. Kindergarten, first, second and third grade.\\nI finished third grade in Rochester and moved away at the end of fifth grade and moved to\\nGolden Valley for sixth grade. I was there for six through twelve then graduated and went on to\\ncollege.\\nAW: And where did you go to college?\\nJJ: Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.\\nAW: When you were in school, you mentioned some art projects and things like that at home.\\nDid you also have anything like that at school?\\nJJ: I started out as a biology major, but when in my second year I was faced with college level\\nchemistry, my high school didn’t prepare me for that so I had to drop out of the major. I couldn’t\\ntake the subsequent science courses because I couldn’t pass chemistry. So I switched in the\\nmiddle of that first semester to an art major which suited me very well. In my junior year I\\nstarted making pottery and that was it. It superseded any other interest I had in school and I spent\\nas much time as I could making pots because I loved it so much. I ended up being the student\\nassistant and the main go to person when the teacher wasn’t there. I would help load kilns and do\\nthings like that.\\nAW: Who was your teacher?\\nJJ: Dean Schwarz. He went abroad for a semester on a Fulbright Scholarship and left a graduate\\nstudent in charge of the class, I think, it was a long time ago. At that time it was very helpful but\\nI also did a lot of work. It helped me understand that it is a whole way of life being a potter\\nbecause of the time and commitment it takes to bringing pots from the clay stage all the way to\\nbeing fired and putting them out there. I was ready for it when I left college. I wanted to not take\\nanother job. For me it was all or nothing, pottery only, and not split my time between having to\\nwork first and then make pots like a hobby. It was too important for me. And I haven’t held a\\nregular job my whole life (laughs)! We’re surviving.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n3\\nMy path, once becoming a potter, I rented studio space or was involved in different studios for\\nthree years after graduation. After the third experience I was really ready to have my own studio\\nand so I looked away from the city, about an hour or hour and a half away. On the trip through\\nthis area I was introduced to this house and felt it was the best of all options I had seen at that\\npoint. It’s a little close to a highway, but it’s quite rural. And it’s a county highway not a main\\nhighway. I was able to purchase the house contract for deed, and at that time I was twenty-four.\\nSo it was a big experiment and I love being here. I lived here from 1975 through 1984, before\\nmeeting Will Swanson, my husband, and he moved up here in 1985 and we were married in\\n1986, when we began to share the studio as potters. Will can tell you his history, but he wasn’t a\\nfull-time potter when we met, but he became that.\\nThrough my years of making pots I’ve made useful functional pottery. I’ve developed glazes and\\ntried to keep a reasonable supply of seven different colors, or glazes. I went to regional art fairs\\nand the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. I started going there in 1972 right after graduating from\\ncollege as an add-on to somebody else who was already doing the show and I was renting studio\\nspace from him. We quit doing it in 1983, I think—\\n00:07:15\\nWS: Ninety-three.\\nJJ: Ninety-three. Excuse me. After Avery was born.\\nWS: Ninety-two was the last year actually.\\nJJ: Oh, ninety-two. Okay.\\nAW: So this is the Renaissance Festival?\\nWS: Yes.\\nJJ: When I first moved here in 1975 I was making pots but I found this house and bought it in the\\nmiddle of winter in March and it was still snowing. The first leaves came out and then the\\nflowers and those were all very wonderful and I spent time drawing them. Those eventually\\nfound their way into being drawn onto tiles or onto pots. This was for fun and creative\\ndevelopment and then making pots was my work. In the beginning I gave myself a little time to\\ndo this, and then moved into spending a week and then two weeks. By the time I met Will, quite\\na while back, from 1975 to 1980s, I was giving myself two months out of the year to explore. At\\nthat time I was working with porcelain clay.\\nAfter we were married I didn’t want to stop doing the exploration with carving and we decided it\\nwas time for me to stop making pottery altogether and focus on making my way with carving\\nporcelain and working towards having a good inventory and good pieces for shows. That took\\nme forward, with that, for nine or ten years. At some point the carving on the porcelain, some of\\nthe subjects that had been shallow relief carving on the surface of lidded boxes enhanced with\\nceladon glazes, some of the subjects started emerging three dimensionally. Some of the subjects\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n4\\nlike tree frogs and toads started having more volume and I didn’t like how that looked with the\\nrest of the carving so I decided to try making small sculptural three-dimensional pieces, in\\nporcelain still. For a few years it was quite frustrating for me and exciting at the same time\\nbecause I love the carving aspect but I didn’t like how the material responded and how it ended\\nup as far as color or the tactile quality and how people responded to unglazed carved porcelain.\\nBy 1995 I was very ready to switch to carving wood, which I did, in the springtime. Since then,\\nI’ve been carving wood and a little bit of mammoth tusk ivory and amber and antler, but mostly\\nwood.\\n00:10:30\\nAW: So learning the functional pottery, is that what you learned at Luther? Or where did you\\npick up that?\\nJJ: Yes. That actually that brings in another area. At Luther, Dean Schwarz was associated with\\nMarguerite Wildenhain from Pond Farm in California. She came to visit and did a workshop\\nwhile I was still in school. She was old by that time but she was still holding summer sessions.\\nShe had been holding nine-week sessions, which is a considerable length.\\nWS: Do you want to describe who she is?\\nJJ: Marguerite Wildenhain was in the first, um, ceramics apprenticeship program at the Bauhaus\\nin Germany and was in the first group of masters that graduated or progressed through the years\\nin that program. She and her husband, Frans Wildenhain, established a studio for a while, but\\nwhen the war [World War II] took place she immigrated to the United States and Frans stayed\\nbehind to serve in the war, whether he wanted to or not. Anyway, she landed in California\\nultimately and with some others started an art colony at Pond Farm. Over time the rest left and\\nshe retained ownership and started teaching classes. She would teach people how to make pots\\nby following a series of shapes and forms, one related to the other. When we were there as\\nstudents, I had already been through the training at college, so I didn’t have to progress right\\nfrom the beginning. She would assign tasks and decoration projects.\\nMany students who have come from those classes still retain characteristics of having studied\\nwith her. I remember her clearly saying, “Don’t make my pots when you leave here. Make your\\nown pots; do your own things”. There are things that are related to how I learned and how I\\nthrow because of that, but I’ve tried to not emulate what she did. Some of the things from there,\\nthe more important things were the drawing classes we had on Wednesdays. The challenges that\\nshe put before us were quite interesting and those skills stay with me when I’m preparing to do a\\ncarving now. One series of things that were paired for us to draw were a stone and a potato and\\nyou’d have to make one look hard and the other look organic. Or a peach and a plum where one\\nis fuzzy and one is shiny. Or crumpled hard angular twisted wire and a soft ball of string. Or to\\nlook at a dead tree with living parts and try to embody that as simply as you can in what is\\ncharacteristic of it. So the training was to see and distill what is characteristic of something and\\nthen be able to express it. That is part of what guides me when I’m working towards doing a\\ncarving.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n5\\nWS: Did you say when you were there?\\nJJ: Um, 1972, 1974 and 1977. The first class was right after I graduated from college.\\nWS: In the summer?\\nJJ: Yes, in the summertime. In 1974 it was the summer before I moved up here and 1977 was\\nafterwards.\\nAW: Tell us a little bit more about what you were saying about your approach and influences of\\nyour carving?\\nJJ: Say again?\\n00:15:00\\nAW: You were just saying that by learning through the drawing classes and really distinguishing\\ntexture. Is that something that has translated into how you approach your carving?\\nJJ: Well, yeah, it was those drawing exercises that directly related to the beginning of carving.\\nWe did carving on tiles and she [Wildenhain] would have us design pots by doing a line drawing\\nwith a knife and then filling in with slip. That’s very characteristic of her work and many\\nstudents’ work that have come from there. I did that a little bit but I didn’t want to do it in the\\nstyle that they were doing and started using my drawings as a basis. What interested me was\\ncarving a little bit away and starting to make a little relief and adding a little bit more clay to\\nmake something more sculptural on the surface rather than what we had been doing there. So,\\nearly on the play of light and shadow with the unglazed clay surface this was appealing to me.\\nWhen I wanted to try and represent a wild rose flower, for instance, on a piece of stoneware,\\nthere is not much you can do to stoneware to make a delicate, elegant flower petal. So I layered\\nporcelain clay onto a pot and then carved that and realized that the porcelain was a lovely\\nmaterial for carving. I started then to throw little pots and carve wild roses onto there. That began\\nmy porcelain carving. So the drawing classes, their influence, enabled me to move forward with\\ncarving on clay. Carving now has been the continuum through all the mediums that I’ve worked\\nin. I consider the pieces that I’m doing not carving like whittling kind of carving, rather I\\nconsider them small sculptures because it takes a long time and it’s just very small movements\\ncompared to large movements that wood sculptors make with a mallet or hammer or something. I\\nuse my fingers and tools, taking little bits away.\\nAW: Why are you drawn to doing this carving, to creating these sculptures? What is it about it\\nthat--?\\nJJ: Well what keeps me doing it is that I love to do it. I get lost, I get absorbed, I am fascinated\\nby the transition from a blank piece of wood and a lumpy roughed out design to and through the\\ndifferent stages of being blocked out and then when the elegance starts happening, getting closer\\nto the finished form. Then when the details start working together, the little nuances in the form\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n6\\nthat work with the light and shadow, it’s very compelling for me to want to get back to work. I\\nget lost, I come up for air every once in a while. In the end, I hope there is something lovely that\\nsomebody else will be moved by when they get to hold it or look at it. It’s a very non-essential\\nluxury item when you look at it from a practical standpoint. It’s a very small, but maybe potent,\\nand sometime interesting story, somewhere on a more intimate scale. Work you can hold in your\\nhand.\\nAW: Yeah you were just telling us about a piece you are working on now. Maybe you could kind\\nof describe your process with that piece?\\nJJ: Well, I was at a family gathering and there was a young boy who spent hours playing with a\\nlarge rainbow colored umbrella. One thing he did in particular with the umbrella, he was\\nstanding off to the side, he stretched his arms up high with the opened umbrella way up in the air\\nand he very theatrically and slowly brought it straight down in front of him. As it hit his head he\\nstarted going into a squat and he started closing the umbrella around himself. By the time he was\\nin a full squat the umbrella was closed as far as it could go, and then he just stayed there for a\\nminute or two. I was enthralled with the whole scene and I said, “That’s got to be a netsuke.\\nThat’s a wonderful little image.”\\nSo it stuck with me and I have been trying to express that in the piece of wood. There are\\nchallenges in trying to carve into the end-grain of a piece of wood to hollow out around the legs\\nas you go into the concave area underneath the umbrella and decide what to keep and what not to\\nkeep and still make it work. It’s hard, one, to carve in an enclosed area, but I have just enough\\ntools to make that work. Then trying to make the umbrella folds on the outside look convincing\\nis the stage that I’m at right now. Once I’m done with those then I’ll carve the inside folds of the\\numbrella, which won’t be cloth thin but I have to try to make them relate to the outside in some\\nway. Then add the holes that will make it a real netsuke, which is, a not often used functional\\nobject from Japan.\\nJapanese men generally have used them because their kimonos don’t have pockets and women’s\\nkimonos have large pockets. A netsuke is the connector or the toggle that tucks under the obi to\\nattach by cord a pouch or smoking paraphernalia or a compartmented box that holds personal\\nitems. Netsuke in the 20th and 21st century, are collectable items (the antiques are). There are a\\nrelatively small number of netsuke carvers working in the world today. It’s a scale I choose to\\nwork in. I don’t always carve netsuke, but it’s the scale of the netsuke I choose to work in. I\\nchoose to work small, in general, because my subjects are small. I’m fascinated with tree frogs,\\ntoads, small flowers and leaves, and I take artist’s license with other things and make them small\\nif I need to. The wood that I use is extremely hard, and working on a larger scale, I did two\\npieces in the past year that are six inches tall, and for me those are very big. Very time\\nconsuming to work on with a lot of detail, but, very satisfying to bring all that surface area\\ntogether in a carving.\\n00:23:30\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n7\\nAW: I was thinking back to when you were first telling us about growing up and your mom\\ntaking you on nature trails and things. Why do you think she was so interested in having you get\\nout in nature?\\nJJ: Well, she grew up in southern Minnesota in the Heron Lake area, and she was an only child\\nand her parents lived on a farm at first and worked in town depending on what they had to do.\\nShe spent all her time or a lot of her time playing by herself outside. It was just natural for her to\\nwant us to be outside because she wanted to be outside. She had to think of things for us to do if\\nwe were pulling each other’s hair out inside. Outside had a lot more space to run around in. I\\nhave to credit her for my not being afraid of snakes or frogs or toads. In being comfortable\\npicking up beetles carefully (laughs). Not all my siblings are like that. My younger sister is very\\nmuch an outside person too. We’re all different in what we’ve chosen to do.\\nAW: What have your siblings done? What careers did they pursue?\\nJJ: Well, one sister is an IT person; presently she’s working as a coordinator for teams that are\\ndeveloping software for a company. My brother—\\nAW: What’s her name?\\nJJ: Laurie. L-A-U-R-I-E Jacobson. My brother Steve, or Steven Jacobson, has had different\\ncareers that have followed an electronics and technical path. Before the kind of digital\\nphotography that can generate larger photographs now, he worked with equipment that were\\ncolor separators and did the scanning. Years ago. As that progressed he moved forward in that\\nindustry until he and his wife started a business helping other small businesses do what they need\\nto do as small businesses. And now, he is working for Mn/DOT, the Minnesota Department of\\nTransportation, again, in a technology area, working with the scanners and sensors in the road.\\nUsing his wisdom there. My younger sister, she has a real regular day job. She works as a\\nreceptionist in a clinic. Her name is Julie Schwartz. Her passion is gardening. She runs a seed\\nexchange for interesting and heirloom seeds. She plants them all to see what they look like. She\\nhas a huge yard that she works on all the time in. My mother’s name is Jackie Jacobson.\\nAW: And your father?\\nJJ: Loren Jacobson. L-O-R-E-N. Jackie was actually Jacqueline, but everybody knows her as\\nJackie.\\nAW: Where did they meet? Is Loren also from southern Minnesota?\\nJJ: Dad was from Rugby, North Dakota, and was going to school for pharmacy, becoming a\\npharmacist, but it was early times of the [Korean] war. He passed the test that allowed him to\\ntake medical school training and that launched him on the career of becoming a physician. She\\nmet him while she was a nurse and he was a young doctor. The rest is history. The family started\\nthen (laughs).\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n8\\nAW: You said also that she encouraged art projects or craft projects? What kind of projects were\\nthose?\\nJJ: Well one memorable thing that we could all do together was that she’d clean off the table,\\nand I can’t remember if she put something down or we just did it on the kitchen table, it was\\nFormica or linoleum or something, and she’d put finger paint on the table and we would just play\\nand play and play. Or it might have been colored soapy bubbles and something or little knitting\\nand loopy frame-weaving projects, just a variety of things. I can’t remember any more. She did\\nencourage us and on the side she would take correspondence courses for painting. She had to be\\nhome so she couldn’t go out and take lessons, so she did that. She always wanted to do more but\\nshe was raising children, so she didn’t.\\n00:29:40\\nAW: In school, this is sort of a follow up question, but in elementary or high school did you ever\\ntake art classes?\\nJJ: Oh sure. I can’t remember if I did every year or every semester but it was something I wanted\\nto do. I was also playing a musical instrument then, so the arts were a part of my life from sixth\\ngrade on. As far as school I very much enjoyed the art classes.\\nAW: What did you enjoy? What were some of your favorites?\\nJJ: Well, in the later classes we were allowed to work maybe a little more independently on\\nprojects and I remember using the acetylene torches and putting things together and trying a little\\nbit of jewelry. When it was time to try making pots the teacher just opened the door and said,\\n“look at that chart and do what it says” (laughs). So my introduction to clay wasn’t very fruitful.\\nIt took a better experience later on for me to find my way. I just like being involved in the arts. I\\nalso enjoyed biology, which shows in my interest in things in nature. Watching, as much as I can\\nfind, the stages of growth that katydids go through for instance, or tadpoles to frogs and knowing\\na little bit about their scientific, or natural progression of what creatures go and grow through,\\nand plants and flowers.\\nAW: What high school did you go to?\\nJJ: Golden Valley High School.\\nAW: So it was class at Luther College when you got hooked on ceramics. What was it about it\\nthat was so appealing to you right away?\\nJJ: It felt good in my hands and I could make the clay move and it was kind of magical to move\\nyour hands in such a way to cause something to be formed. Each successful step towards being\\nable to make larger, bigger and deliberate shapes was self-rewarding in a way. It was something I\\ncould challenge myself with and accomplish. It was easy to get hooked. I enjoyed the\\ncamaraderie between the students and I liked, I’m kind of a loner, so I liked the quiet times when\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n9\\nthe classes weren’t there when I could work and do something and be productive. I like doing\\nthings. I’m not a good couch potato.\\nAW: When you graduated, walk us through how you kind of thought, “okay, I’m going to make\\na go at this”?\\nJJ: I graduated and I had—\\nAW: That was in 1972?\\n[Additional comment from JJ post-interview: When I graduated, my intention was one of all or\\nnothing: make pots and survive financially. I did not want pottery making to be relegated to\\nbeing pushed into hobby time activity outside of day-job working hours. I knew that my entire\\nfocus needed to be towards making pottery for my living, and to support the love and respect that\\nI had for it.]\\nJJ: In 1972 and I had an interval between my first class at Pond Farm and I went to Pond Farm\\nand that was a nine week experience which was very interesting and challenging. I camped out\\nall summer and got put through the paces and got indoctrinated to the pace of Marguerite’s\\nclasses and getting to know who she was. She would read to us during our coffee breaks and\\nhave philosophical discussions. There was very much more than what we had in college as far as\\nclass work.\\nWhen I left Pond Farm I came back and I don’t exactly remember how it happened but I\\nconnected with a potter who had a place in St. Paul and I rented studio space from him for half a\\nyear, and then someone else. These were potters that were graduates of Luther. There was\\nanother potter who, um, I knew at Luther who had a place in Illinois and he said, “Come work\\nhere for a while.” So, I was there for about eight months, then moved back to the metro area\\nwhen someone said, “I’ve been looking for you. I want you to come help me run this shop for a\\nwhile.” So I did that for about fourteen months. When I was done I was ready to not have to fit\\nwhat I wanted to do into a routine that was dictated by where I was. Then I moved out to here.\\n00:35:32\\nAW: What was it about this place that was attractive to you?\\nJJ: Well, for me it was that it had a big enough area to have a small studio in and it was a\\nreasonable price for an old house. It needed a lot of work and it still does, but it was achievable\\nand I could begin making it happen. Instead of doing a two building system like we have now,\\nbeing alone, I could live and work in the same place and make it work.\\nAW: So you had a studio in here [the house]?\\nJJ: Yeah. In the room over there and in this room, that’s where I made the pots. That’s the parlor.\\nI built ware racks on the walls and kind of had to walk sideways through everything [tables and\\nwheels in the small room] when things were busy. In here there were ware racks and a\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n10\\nwoodworking bench and mostly ware racks. I tried keeping the floor clean so I wouldn’t track it\\n[clay] everywhere. I got a Shop-Vac and changed the filter a lot.\\nAW: How old is this house?\\nJJ: It was built in 1911, so it’s one hundred and three years old. The very first year I had electric\\nservice put on the back porch, which was then outside, now it’s kind of an indoor space, and\\nfired and glazed with an electric kiln. But I preferred gas firing so in that first year, the beginning\\nof the second year, I arranged to have a kiln building built and I had a gas kiln built out there. I\\nwanted to be in the country. I didn’t want to be close to the city, which is one reason why I was\\nlooking within an hour to an hour and a half drive from the city. So people could drive out for\\npots on a day trip if they wanted to. And I wanted to be near a river. The Sunrise River goes kind\\nof around, you can see the river or hear the river, from two or three sides of the house. We’re\\nabout a mile and a quarter from the St. Croix River, which is the [state] border.\\nAW: Looks like a lot of trees and a wooded area, was that also appealing to be able to go outside\\nand walk around and see the flowers and—\\nJJ: Yes, I can’t imagine living smack dab in the middle of the city. I might have to someday but\\nnow the few wonderful months we have of spring and summer go by so quickly. Every time\\nwe’re in the middle of it I think, this is where the memories are made for the many months of\\nwinter that we have where it changes but its unchanging when it’s cold and white. It’s just very\\nremarkable to be able to watch and recognize how things are changing how it sounds and how it\\nsmells and how the light [changes] as the sun goes higher in the sky, and now as we’re on the\\nbeginning of the decent towards darkness (laughs). I worked so much this winter, every winter I\\nlook forward to, well, my birthday is on the winter solstice, I look forward to that day because\\nthe days will start getting longer very soon. I try to promise myself that I’m going to recognize\\nevery longer part of every day, but when I started working on the piece that I worked on from\\nJanuary through the end of March I was just kind of blinded. I had so many hours every day that\\nI had to work, and I wanted to work, that day length was kind of removed from my awareness\\nuntil the end of March and April. By then it was already spring. So May and June [this year]\\nhave been my months of awakening and enjoyment, I guess!\\n00:40:15\\nAW: When you bought the house were you able to do that on your own?\\nJJ: Dad and mom cosigned the contract for deed and I occasionally needed to borrow money\\nfrom him, which I did pay back as pots made money for me. It was a reasonable arrangement.\\nBack then, in 1975, the property prices were far different then they are now. This house, and the\\nhalf a city block that it is on, was eighteen thousand five hundred dollars. There’s a bit across the\\nroad that is partly on the Sunrise River between the highway and the road and that was three\\nthousand. It had a big barn on it but that collapsed for various other reasons. So, the payments\\nwere set at a reasonable amount and I had permission to double or triple them if I could and I did\\nwhen I could. I was able to get close to paying it off, then when Will and I joined our resources\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n11\\nwe were able to pay more and we did finally pay off the contract. I think I had a fifteen-year\\ncontract. So, it worked.\\nAW: That leads into another question. How did your family respond to your decision to pursue\\nceramics?\\nJJ: They were supportive. They would come up and help do things. Dad helped me to become\\nfamiliar with using tools and impressed on me I could rely on other people for some things but\\nthere were many things I could do myself. Mom came up and helped clean and paint and just to\\nspend time. The whole family decided to have a big garden up here and for a few years we did\\ngarden together and then I maintained it when they weren’t here. The interest finally fell away\\nbut everybody liked being here. Eventually, lives got busy and it got a whole lot more quiet.\\nAW: So when you moved out here, what was it like?\\nJJ: It was fairly quiet. Something that is missing now but was present back then was that there\\nwere many more dairy farmers. There was a creamery truck that would drive by every day and\\npick up milk from the various places. The other noisy thing would be gravel trucks that would\\ndrive from up by Harris to somewhere with their loads. Now, we don’t have the creamery trucks\\nbut we have frac sand trucks driving by and dumping their loads in a gravel pit that was formed\\nover the last fifteen years just to the east of here. They’re not pleasant, but right now the bridge is\\nbeing rebuilt so we don’t have them driving by. And I hope that the frac sand agreement reaches\\na conclusion here and moves somewhere else.\\nAW: Tell us a little bit about that?\\nJJ: North Branch, which is eight to ten miles away is known as a bedroom community. Out here\\nthere is a mixture of old people and self-reliant people who do something on their own or people\\nwho commute. So, the roadways are busy differently because we live eighty to a hundred feet\\nfrom the county highway, there’s more and less traffic during the day and [at] different times\\nduring the day. Towards the evening, when people are done coming home, all the work trucks\\nstop working and it’s very quiet, very peaceful, and very pleasant to be outside.\\nWe live on a road that goes north to Wild River State Park. During the summertime that is very\\nbusy with canoe rental [vehicles]. So every now and then we have rattle-y contraptions going by,\\nbut we know it’s for fun.\\n00:45:25\\nAW: When you were looking at this location, is this part of why you ended up getting it, because\\nit was so close to a county road?\\nJJ: I think my father was pleased that it was less isolated because I was young and a girl. I\\nwanted to be removed from buildings and cars and noise. I very much like solitude and actually\\nin high school I worked at a canoe base. So working in northern Minnesota indoctrinated me to\\nthe peaceful quiet way of living. This was a good compromise. The place was right for my\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n12\\nmoving into. It was a compromise between being more accessible, from my parents’ concerns\\nand being close to the river and quiet spaces.\\nAW: How did you build an audience at that time? Or who were your customers at that time?\\nJJ: Well, I was hooked up with the Renaissance Festival by that time. The first year I went with a\\nperson who had his own booth and I had a couple of pots in the corner. The next year I had my\\nown booth and every other year after that I had my own booth. Through that I built a mailing list\\nand audience interest. I also started doing regional art fairs in the metropolitan area and in St.\\nCloud and built a mailing list from that. I started having spring and fall sales or late fall, early\\nwinter Christmas sales—\\nWS: Here.\\nJJ: Here at the studio. I had a showroom in the front room, the atrium that you walked into and\\nthen up the stairs, which these days, isn’t such a good idea, but it worked back then for most\\npeople. It’s funny, local people would sometimes stop and they would go up the stairs, older\\nwomen especially, to look at the pots and I would hear them walking up the hallway and there is\\na hallway with rooms on either side and I would hear them opening and closing all the doors.\\nThey would say, “oh, I used to come over here and play with Franny and we could only go up\\nthe back stairs and we never got to go anywhere else in the house” (laughs). So they wanted to\\nsee the rest of the house. It was so funny. I bought the house from the woman who lived next\\ndoor who was born and raised in the house. We’re the second owners.\\nWS: It was built by her [neighbor woman] grand father.\\nJJ: That’s right. Yeah. There was a hotel in the front, well, west of the house called the Mold\\nHotel, M-O-L-D, and they were the original settlers and original owners of the property here, and\\nas the hotel came down they built this house. It was the children of the person that built the hotel,\\nArt and Ida Mold, who built this house and had two children [here], and I bought the house from\\nthem.\\nWS: The family name was Mold.\\nAW: How do you spell the last name?\\nJJ: M-O-L-D. German.\\nAW: So there was a hotel on this property at one point?\\nJJ: Yeah. When we dig holes we sometimes see the remains, like out there we can see plaster and\\nsand from some part of it, somewhere else there are [foundation] rocks. I found a big brass key\\nand old clay pipes, tobacco pipes. Interesting things coming out of the ground.\\nAW: Wow, that’s amazing. What was the community like then when you moved in? Was there\\nsome dairy farmers or--?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n13\\n00:49:50\\nJJ: People had different means of employment. One younger woman, she’s four or five years\\nyounger than I am, she came over with her newborn baby and said “this is who I am” and\\nbasically I got to join their family. She had three or four kids and so I had my children surrogates\\nthat when I went over for dinner they would sit on my lap. We had fun. There was a group of\\nwomen that invited people to their homes, one place or another every month, and we chatted and\\ngot to know each other. Eventually that stopped happening for one reason or another. So, I felt\\nmore of a community locally. It was kind of a parallel community to ceramics and pots, which\\nwere other people. These were the local people that were willing to include me in their activities.\\nI’m not local, even though I’ve been here since 1975. There’s a distinction between if you’re\\nborn and raised here from long ago, then you’re local. Avery’s been born and raised here but I\\ndon’t know if he would be considered “local”, but my neighbors were local and all the women\\nthat invited me to their houses they all moved in at one time or another but they’ve all been here\\nsince then. Nobody has moved away. Once we got here we stayed. When our son was born in\\n1991, we had Janice Loger from across the river who was local, born and raised here, come and\\ngive me a break [by babysitting] so I could work three hours a day after he was a year old. She\\nwas a grandma to him, which was nice. So it kind of knitted us together a little bit more with the\\ncommunity. In those earlier years of my being here, I could go to North Branch and I would\\nknow people on the street. Now, there are so many more people, and so many of the people I\\nknew have gotten old and don’t go to town anymore. It’s much more of a generic small town\\nthan it used to be, less welcoming in a way because the downtown isn’t where everybody goes\\nanymore. Now there is a shopping mall or people drive twenty or twenty-five miles away to the\\nbig box stores. You know? It’s all changed.\\nAW: Thank you very much for sharing all this. It helps us understand how you got to this place\\nand the meaning of this place to you. Now, when did you meet Will? How did you guys meet?\\nJJ: One of the regional art fairs I was doing was St. Kate’s or St. Catherine’s in St. Paul and—\\nWS: The Minnesota Crafts Council.\\nJJ: Yeah, put on by the Minnesota Crafts Council. And he bought a pot from me, so I had his\\nname on my mailing list. Then, that fall, he came to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival, and\\nthere is a side story with that but I don’t need to tell that, but he hung around and the cannon\\nwent off, which means the gates were closing. My mom told him, “well, you better get to work if\\nyou’re going to hang around.” (laughs) And put pots away. This was Sunday night. That was the\\nbeginning of our long life of conversations.\\nWS: (Laughs) It then became a family joke also, in that her mother would repeat “You better get\\nto work and get your pottery made” or “you better get to work and do this” from that initial time\\nwhen I met her. Anyway.\\nJJ: Well we had had a meeting here several years before. He and his first wife and two friends\\nstopped by early in the spring when the river had just opened up. They were canoeing on the\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n14\\nriver and they stopped here to see the pots. That was mentioned and I recalled that, but it wasn’t\\nreally where we met as far as my memory goes.\\nWS: You remember that event and I remember the event but I don’t remember if I had ever met\\nyou before then or if this was the first time I ever laid eyes on you here.\\nJJ: Yeah, that I don’t remember.\\n00:55:05\\nWS: I remember seeing your exhibit of pottery at the Jewish community center in 1980 or\\nsometime.\\nJJ: Oh yeah, it was carved porcelain then.\\nWS: Yeah, that was your first little carvings. I just happened to be there.\\nJJ: So we met and at that time the telephone between here and the city was long distance, so we\\nran up our phone bills as we found out we enjoyed talking a lot. That was 1984. In 1985 we\\ndecided to see how it worked to be living together, because I had lived alone for so long. And\\nthat worked.\\nWS: It’s still working pretty well.\\nJJ: Yeah. (Laughs) Then in 1986 we were married. In 1991 we had a child. I was forty when he\\nwas born; I didn’t know I could become pregnant, but that’s beside the point. It was a real\\nwonderful surprise. Now he’s twenty-three.\\nAW: Where is he now?\\nJJ: He’s in Minneapolis. Do you want to know some of the interesting part of his story?\\nWS: (Laughs)\\nAW: Sure!\\nJJ: I don’t know how far back we need to go, but in college he started out as a biochemistry\\nmajor. His high school experience his last two years of high school were at the Perpich Center\\nfor the Arts. He was in theater. On the weekends he took voice and musical performance classes\\nat MacPhail [Center for Music in Minneapolis]. In his first semester of his second year at\\nEarlham College our family gathered on the East coast for Thanksgiving and he and a friend\\nwent to see a Broadway performance. That kind of hit him right between the eyes, it just like\\n“wham! I should have been up on the stage.” His desire to be performing again came back even\\nthough he was doing well with biochemistry. He decided to look into and apply to theater\\nschools and he got into one he wanted to get into but we couldn’t afford the tuition for four more\\nyears. So, he made a very difficult personal decision and called us a couple weeks after our\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n15\\nsaying, “we can’t do it but you can if you want to” and decided to be an art major with ceramics\\nas his focus. It surprised us. We had no idea that he had that kind of interest.\\nWS: Well, he had always been so involved in the arts and music and theater that he hadn’t paid\\nmuch attention to my making pottery, for example. He would help me recycle clay and do some\\ntasks, usually when I’d pay him, (laughs) but he was paying attention. He understood our life in\\nthe arts, which was what he was looking for.\\nJJ: And he helped sell at the pottery tour and he was involved with that, but he hadn’t really\\nmade pots then. So he asked, “would you teach me how to make pots when I come home?” He\\nwas already committed; the ceramics teacher was his advisor.\\nWS: The end of his sophomore year that was.\\nJJ: The end of his sophomore year he came home and learned how to make pots. He “got it” in\\nthe time period that would indicate whether or not it would succeed. I tried teaching the steps and\\nhe kind of brushed that off as soon as he figured out how he could move forward on his own. So,\\nI did what I could to encourage him and tell him where things could get better and maybe a little\\nbit on how to get around the problems he was having. By the end of the summer he made some\\nfairly decent pots for having worked six or seven weeks.\\nWS: Then he went back to college and took over the job of student assistant in the shop and\\nhelping to be kind of a student teaching assistant. For his junior and senior year he was sort of\\nthe big dog in the ceramics department, it sounds like, at this small college.\\nJJ: Yeah, for two years. Then he graduated in—\\nAW: Which college was this?\\nJJ: Earlham. E-A-R-L-H-A-M. He graduated last year, in July 2013.\\nWS: It’s in Indiana.\\nJJ: Then he committed to being a mutual apprentice with Sam Taylor and Mark Shapiro—\\nWS: Who are potters in Massachusetts.\\nJJ: They are also guests on our tour [St. Croix Pottery Tour]. So he spent a year in Massachusetts\\nworking with them part-time and having to have a job part-time.\\n01:00:15\\nWS: He’s now back in Minnesota, having just moved back.\\nJJ: He worked at a co-op grocery store that had a deli counter that also had a bakery. He trained\\nin with the baker and started taking over baking duties and—\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n16\\nWS: Because his pottery apprenticeship was unpaid, so he needed a job. So he worked at this\\nbakery place.\\nJJ: By the end of his year he said, “I want to be a baker.” (Laughs) So he found a job in\\nMinneapolis and he’s very happy.\\nAW: Can I ask which bakery?\\nJJ: Sun Street Breads on 46th and Nicollet. He’s the tall slender young man working there, right\\nnow, in the summer, Sunday through Thursday, if you happen to go in before ten.\\nWS: Well, he goes in at either two or four in the morning.\\nJJ: Yeah, and he’s out by ten or noon. Nice guy. They like him and he likes them. I’m very\\nhappy for him.\\nWS: And in a way it’s very much like making pottery; making bread. Making pastries and stuff.\\nJJ: Except you make your product and you sell it all in the same day and you make people happy.\\nYou can see them being happy. With pots, you have to wait weeks and months to get that done.\\nIt’s a very long process and very complex in getting it all balanced and still try and make a living\\nwith it. It suits him, I think, very well. He’s happy and he has prospect for growth.\\nAW: Well that’s exciting to see his interest in ceramics. His interest in biochemistry is also part\\nof pottery too, right? You’re seeing how the glazes work and the chemistry that is going on there.\\nJJ: Yeah, and I think knowing both of those, understanding both biochemistry and making pots,\\nhe’s a maker. All things rely on chemical reactions and I think it will all inform him throughout\\nhis life. What he has learned so far.\\nTM: I wish I had the patience for biochemistry. Not my forte. (Laughs)\\nJJ: It was fun when he talked about things in his pre-pottery days. The enthusiasm he had from\\nthe [science] classes he was learning from. It was very much surprising that he changed his mind.\\nYou never know.\\nAW: You never know. You find a career that brings them all together or maybe this is what\\nbaking does for him.\\nWS: He went, in his junior year of high school, he went to the Perpich Center for the Arts and\\nlived in the Twin Cities. It was a residential [school] with kids from all over the state of\\nMinnesota. So it was coming to an arts high school and starting over. You know, leaving all the\\nkids you were with from kindergarten through tenth grade behind and meeting all these kids who\\nwere artists and musicians and starting over with them. I think that had a big influence on what\\nhe wants to do for the rest of his life. He wants to be involved in creating things. So, anyway—\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n17\\nAW: That’s great. Maybe one day someone will do an oral history with him about a career in\\nceramics. Who knows?\\nAW: Well Will, if we could spend a little bit of time on you now. If you could give us a little\\noverview of when you were born and where did you grow up?\\nWS: Boy, I’ve been very patient at listening. It’s hard not to jump in and want to comment. Well\\nlet’s see. I was born in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1947. My parents at the time lived in St.\\nCharles, Minnesota, a small town. My father was teaching what was called “Veterans Ag”,\\nwhich was, people coming back from World War II could take classes under the G.I. Bill, he was\\nteaching agriculture classes because he had a degree in agriculture.\\n01:04:48\\nAW: What was his name?\\nWS: His name was Ray, Raymond Swanson.\\nBut, shortly after I was born, he had an opportunity to move to Marshall, Minnesota, out on the\\nprairie in western Minnesota. Someone that he had met years before who admired his managerial\\nabilities took him on as a partner in a hardware store. Up until I was nine, or eight and a half\\nyears old, we lived in Marshall, Minnesota. My father was the manager and partner of the Smith\\nand Swanson Hardware Store. It was great; I used to, after kindergarten each day, go and hang\\nout at the hardware store, which I liked a lot. This was in Marshall, Minnesota. Then my father\\nwho had grown up on a farm, both my parents grew up on farms and much of our family culture\\nhad to do with their being from the farm. They never really saw themselves as ‘town folks’ so\\nmuch as folks who had moved in from the farm.\\nMy father went to work, after the hardware store, for something called the Federal Land Bank,\\nwhich is now called Farm Credit Services. It’s a cooperative lending institution that lends money\\nto farmers to buy land. Mostly it’s land, I think, huge amounts of money to buy your neighbors\\nfarm or that kind of thing. My father really liked working with people and was really smart. He\\nwas hired to do this out in Marshall, Minnesota, and when he was promoted he was given the\\nmanager-ship of another office in Glencoe, Minnesota, which is then where I lived from the time\\nI was in third grade all the way through high school. Glencoe, Minnesota, is just an hour\\nsouthwest of the Twin Cities. It’s in really rich farm country, kind of the beginning of the prairie\\nin Minnesota. My father was there through a time when farming was really thriving and land\\nvalues were rising. Farmers were doing well. He took great pride in never having to foreclose on\\nanyone. I think he was a very well respected person in those several counties that he worked in.\\nSo he was a manager. Shortly after we moved there we rented a house and then we had to move\\nfrom that house because somebody wanted to live there and we had to find another place to live.\\nMy father rented a farmhouse that sat three miles out of town next to a barn, a granary and a\\nchicken coop. The farmer who owned it also owned the farm next door and lived next door, so\\nwe lived on this farmstead. In a sense I got to grow up in this rural farmstead with a big grove of\\ntrees out behind, a pond, and a meadow; all these places to wonder around and go out and hunt\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n18\\npheasants after school and things like that. So I had this kind of unique upbringing in that I lived\\nin the country and wandered around in the woods a lot. This is part of how I kind of ended up\\nmoving out of the city years later, because I didn’t want to live the rest of my life in the city. So\\nthat [growing up in the country] had some influence on where I wanted to land years later. My\\nparents had both grown up on farms so they were very comfortable being out on this homestead.\\nFor me it was a chance to wander around in nature a lot. We raised some chickens and the farmer\\nnext door raised pigs. We would feed table scraps to the pigs and play in the barn, which was full\\nof hay. My younger brother and I, we weren’t supposed to, but we would move the bales around\\nand build forts. We kind of got to play on the farm without having a lot of the responsibilities of\\nthe farm. We didn’t have chores to do on the farm. Anyway, that was a wonderful place to grow\\nup. I think I was lucky to have had that.\\n01:10:00\\nAW: What was your mother’s name?\\nWS: My mother’s name is Mae. M-A-E. Mae Thurston Swanson.\\nAW: And you said you have a brother?\\nWS: Well I have two brothers. I was one of three boys. I have a brother who is five and a half\\nyears older, who was a senior in high school when I was in seventh grade, and I have a brother\\nwho is two and a half years younger and was three years behind me in school. So my younger\\nbrother and I were much closer than my older brother and I. My younger brother, unfortunately,\\npassed away when he was twenty-two years old. So for most of my adult life it’s been my older\\nbrother and I, the remaining family. But my younger brother and I enjoyed being out there on the\\nfarmstead.\\nWe went to school in Glencoe, Minnesota, and I graduated from high school in Glencoe,\\nMinnesota. It was a town of about two thousand people, a farming community that was very\\nmuch, almost entirely a separate small community. There were very few people who drove the\\nsixty miles from there to Minneapolis to work. Not very many; this was I the 1960s. Growing up\\nthere as a child you kind of learned where people fit, you know, who were the Lutherans, who\\nwere the Catholics, who were the farmers, who were the townies. There were all these kind of\\ndivisions, which were both positive and negative, just like any small town. But it had enormous\\npossibilities for things that I got involved in like athletics and music. I could do as much as my\\nabilities allowed me to do and I got involved in all kinds of things.\\nAW: Like what? What are some of the athletics or musical things you got involved in?\\nWS: Well, from the time I was a little boy I used to ride my bike the three miles into town to\\nplay little league baseball every day. Back then we had these wonderful little league teams that\\nwould play against every little small town all around. We’d get on a school bus and ride away for\\nthe day out to Buffalo Lake, Minnesota, or Hutchinson, Minnesota, or somewhere. We had\\nwoolen uniforms, you know, it was really organized. So we played baseball all summer. But\\nthat’s little kids stuff. Athletics are big in small town Minnesota. It’s a lot to do with the identity\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n19\\nof the town. I think every boy who could would want to be on the team, so I wanted to be on the\\nbaseball team and the football team; I did all those things up to my ability. I ended up doing\\nsome of them rather well and some not as well, like when I discovered everyone was a foot taller\\nthan me on the basketball team. Then I went out for wrestling (laughs). Anyway, there were lots\\nof other opportunities to be involved in school through student government and the yearbook and\\nall that kind of stuff. I did a lot of music; I was always a singer and I played in the band.\\nAW: What did you play?\\n01:13:48\\nWS: I played the trumpet, but I wasn’t a great musician, I was a better singer. I wasn’t like Janel\\nwho really excelled. She was a saxophone player and continued to play in college in the college\\nband. She still plays today. I sang a lot all through school, all through college and with other\\ngroups after college, like the Minnesota Choral with the Minnesota Orchestra and things like\\nthat. So music was always important and something that I was good at and got recognition for.\\nI graduated from high school in Glencoe in 1965. That was a long time ago (laughs)! The next\\nyear I went to Gustavus Adolphus for college, where I sang in the choir and thought I would\\nbecome a Lutheran minister, because I really respected the ministers in my small town. So I was\\na philosophy major until I kind of decided I wasn’t really a believer like all these other Lutheran\\nbelievers were and I wanted to be somewhere bigger. After two years at Gustavus I went to the\\nUniversity of Minnesota and changed my major to humanities.\\nNow that’s a very confusing time and I’m not sure that I should go into all the details, but this\\nwas during the Vietnam War. The draft was coming up so that everyone who was in school, well,\\nyou were either in school making full time progress or you’d get drafted and sent to Vietnam. So\\nthere was always that pressure going on. Actually, what I wanted to do was join VISTA or the\\nPeace Corps. Which I could have because I had been accepted into VISTA, Volunteers in\\nService to America, but they told me as soon as I finish my year in VISTA I would be drafted\\nbecause then I would be a year behind in school. My school progress would be a year behind. So\\nI turned that down and went back to school at the University. I kind of floundered around not\\nknowing exactly what to major in and what to do. I was very socially involved in doing music\\nand performance at the University. I sang in the University Chamber Singers, which is this really\\ngood group, a small group of select singers.\\nAnyway, I had applied to my draft board to be recognized as a conscientious objector to the\\nVietnam War, which they turned me down and then there was an appeal to the State Board.\\nEventually I ended up actually being designated as a conscientious objector after I had\\nvolunteered for the draft, which is like volunteering for national service, but only as a\\nconscientious objector. I was refusing to be in the military. So at that time I actually found a job\\nfor myself, and the draft board assigned me to work at this job for two years. I was assigned by\\nthe draft board to work alternate service to the draft, as it was called, for two years at Fairview\\nHospital in Minneapolis as an orderly. And eventually, after a short time, they had actually hired\\nme to work in the psychiatric ward. So I began working in the psychiatric ward in 1969 at\\nFairview and worked there full time, well supposedly full-time for two years I had to work there\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n20\\nas assigned by the draft board, which I did. I ended up working there until, at least part-time,\\nuntil 1985 (laughs), so I was there for fifteen or sixteen years, parts of those years. In between I\\nwent back to school and finished a degree in social work and continued to work full-time helping\\nto develop programs at Fairview Hospital having to do with adolescent psychiatry. We had short-term\\ntreatment programs and crisis evaluation programs. For many years I worked in the crisis\\nunit where we would evaluate kids coming in for other placement. Anyway, so I mostly worked\\nwith adolescents in the psychiatric ward. But then I went back to school and finished my degree\\nin social work/social welfare. Then I started taking classes in the evening, pottery classes and\\nsculpture classes and drawing classes. At some point I decided I was going to pursue art and not\\nsocial work or psychology. That was the big decision that I made.\\nAW: Why did you decide that?\\nWS: The basic reason, I had already spent ten to twelve years working with people who were\\npretty miserable, people who were anxious, psychotic, out of touch with reality. My coworkers\\nwere great, you know, it was really a challenge to commiserate with your coworkers to try to\\nfigure out how to help these people- all the way from psychiatrists to psychiatric nurses to other\\npsychiatric technicians, which was my classification. I decided I didn’t want to spend the rest of\\nmy life working with people who were so miserable. I wasn’t really burnt out so much as I was\\nmaking the decision to move on to something else. And along the way that had been kind of\\nnudged by liking the sculpture classes and the pottery classes; things I had taken at the U\\n[University of Minnesota] in evening school or Saturday school or whenever I was doing it.\\nThen at some point I thought, well I should get a degree in art if I’m going to do something else.\\nAt one point I thought maybe I would get a degree in landscape architecture. I realized I was\\nyears behind in architecture and couldn’t really catch up--. Anyway, it was suggested to me that I\\ngo to the design department in St. Paul and take some design classes and see how I liked that.\\nThen I could show the architecture department that I had this experience in design. So I went to\\nthe St. Paul campus at the University of Minnesota and the design department, which is\\ntraditionally in the College of Home Economics, which meant most of the students were women.\\nMost of them were studying interior decorating or fabric design or fashion design, but I enjoyed\\nthe classes. The classes were a straightforward two-dimensional design, color, three-dimensional\\ndesign; very straightforward just conceptual design ideas and I really liked it. This was what\\nreinforced my sense that I could do something in the aesthetic realm. You know, the way things\\nlook to us and how we appreciate objects and things could be important. That the basic social\\nand human values that we all share by enjoying dinner around the table together, or whatever, the\\nthings that go into making that work could.\\nThis fellow in the design department [Eugene Larkin] really encouraged me. I took the whole\\nsequence of undergraduate design classes in the design department. I took drawing, two-dimensional\\ndesign, color, three-dimensional design and surface fabric design, we did weaving,\\nwe did surface fabric printing, a lot of traditional craft things. And then, he said, why don’t you\\napply to graduate school? So I did. I got in and ended up doing a graduate degree at the\\nUniversity of Minnesota in the design department. I got to be a TA and I taught the three-dimensional\\ndesign class while I was there. At the same time I got to take, I did what was called\\na graduate minor, in the studio arts department over on the Minneapolis campus, which is\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n21\\nceramics and sculpture. Which is what I knew I was really interested in (laughs). Maybe I would\\nmake pottery someday.\\nSomewhere along the line there I had run into, well probably ten years before, I had run into\\nWarren MacKenzie and his pottery, and Jeff Oestreich and his pottery, before I even knew Janel.\\nI admired what they were doing.\\n01:23:50\\nAW: What was it about ceramics that you knew that this was something you really wanted?\\nWS: I think, for me, the physicality of it. I like working with clay. I like that the process was so\\nfascinating. The fire was interesting. You know there is this whole world of ceramics that is so\\nhuge you could pick your own section and work in it. I think I had great admiration at the time\\nfor people who had worked with Warren, in particular, Mark Pharis and Wayne Branum, two of\\nhis students who are the same age as I am virtually, but they were working with him when they\\nwere young students at the University [of Minnesota]. I was coming along ten years later. But\\nthey had made a lot of handsome pots over the years, which I enjoyed seeing. I had bought a lot\\nof pots over the years, I wasn’t a big collector; I would just buy some things to use, but I enjoyed\\nusing them and sharing them with other people.\\nYou asked me what it was about ceramics, part of it was the idea of working for yourself and\\npart of it, as much as I don’t really like to admit it, was kind of a lifestyle choice. I want to\\ndecide what I want to do and I want to be in charge of the creative part of it. I don’t want my life\\nto be under the thumb of some institution or organization or managerial system where I’m not\\nallowed to do what I want to do or I’m just working for someone else. I kind of discourage\\npeople some days when I say this isn’t just a lifestyle choice, you know, you really have to care\\nabout those pieces of pottery (laughs). But it was somewhat for me certainly. Just as Janel talks\\nabout how wonderful it is to be out here in the country every day, I feel the same way every time\\nI walk from here to the workshop. I feel that I’m lucky to be here and it was a great choice.\\nJJ: It’s a lot of work to maintain it. When all your lawn mowers aren’t working—(laughs)\\nWS: (Laughs) Yeah, like right now.\\nJJ: You take out the scythe. There are just ways around it. There is some responsibility to making\\nit a lovely place to be.\\nWS: I think personally for me, the choice of ceramics, was tied up a little bit in the force of the\\nmilitary decision that was put onto me when I was eighteen or nineteen years old. You know, are\\nyou going to go to Vietnam, are you going to join the Army? From you have to you don’t have\\nany choice, to, kind of saying, no, I’m going to do this with my life. That was always a powerful\\ninfluence and I was going to do something humane, something with human, intimate, aesthetic\\nvalue. In fact, when I first met Warren MacKenzie and saw what he was doing, it wasn’t his skill\\nat making pots that impressed me, it was his looking at this object and thinking, boy, this is\\nreally nice, you know, I could have this in my life. You could take it and use it; it could be a\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n22\\nvaluable thing to you. It was kind of a non-masculine thing that he was doing that was okay.\\nGrowing up like I did in kind of a sexist mid-twentieth century environment, women had certain\\nroles and men had certain roles. Men sitting around looking at pottery was not something I\\nexpected, but it was always something I had kind of done. My mother and I always enjoyed\\nmaking things look nice. She always said she had three boys, so I got to be her helper, because I\\nwas the one who cared about setting the table and stuff like that. So I was always tuned into the\\nway things looked.\\nWS: Anyway, when I saw Warren paying attention to how things were made and how they\\nlooked and how they could be important to people, that’s what I wanted to do. I didn’t want to be\\nWarren MacKenzie; I didn’t want to necessarily be a teacher or make the pots that he was\\nmaking but the fact that he was equating it and here he was in the University [of Minnesota]\\nclassroom and right down the hall was painting and sculpture. Well, maybe ceramics is important\\ntoo if it is here, you know. So it seemed viable to me and it seemed physical and it seemed close\\nat hand. It seemed like something I could kind of wrap my hands around.\\nAW: It seems like it was a very moving time for you. It was interesting, because Bob was\\nreflecting on too the time period, that the Vietnam War was going on and that influenced part of\\nhis decision to not participate in that and part of protesting the Vietnam War was pursuing this\\nlifestyle. It seems there might be some parallels.\\nWS: Yeah, we’ve talked about that.\\nAW: What were some of the pressure, if I could ask? Because I imagine all over the country,\\nparticularly in small towns, the pressure might have been more intensive?\\n01:29:35\\nWS: In small town Minnesota, my local draft board, for example, was made up of three or four\\nguys that were all recruited from the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization. So they were all\\nveterans, they’d all been in the army and they just kind of rubber stamped things. At the time I\\nwas working part-time as a draft counselor helping people figure out what to do with their draft\\nboard, how to apply to the draft board for this, that and the other. So I in a sense knew the\\nregulations better than these guys did. Anyway, I shouldn’t go on about that, but every selective\\nservice board had a secretary, a county secretary, and she would be the one who really ran the\\nboard. She would tell the men what to do and they would kind of rubberstamp it, that’s the way it\\nseemed to me. At first they turned me down and said, “no you can’t do this” and “no one has\\never done this in our district before since World War II”. Anyway, it was a very specific\\nsituation in that there was someone else doing it at the same time who was a friend of mine. He\\nended up being one of the “Minnesota Eight”, which was this group of people that broke into the\\ndraft boards and eventually ended up going to federal prison. One of these young men was a\\nfriend of mine and he was involved in some other things going on.\\nWhat happened was the state board sent down some overseers to watch the next meeting, and the\\nnext meeting happened to be when I was having this review of my conscientious objector status.\\nSo, the draft board was really on their best behavior and I did this political thing, I went around\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n23\\nand--I was fairly well known around town as a responsible young person who was involved in\\nlots of things—so I went around and I had this character reference thing. All the ministers in\\ntown and the principal of the school and some other upright citizens in town, doctors and\\nlawyers, signed this thing saying, “we don’t agree with this young man but we think he is\\nsincere.” So then I presented this thing to them [draft board] and they were looking not just at me\\nbut they were looking at this list of all these names of upstanding people in town who said, “we\\nbelieve this kid.” At the time I was thinking and probably saying that I was going into the\\nministry, the Lutheran ministry. So they were looking at me as more of a traditional religious\\nguy, although, Lutheranism didn’t fit with pacifism. At any rate, I was intense about it and they\\neventually said, “okay, just go do it.” I said, “If you give me this, I’ll do two years of alternate\\nservice.” Which is like volunteering for the draft, so then they said okay. It was embarrassing in\\na way because there were lots of kids who didn’t know the law, who didn’t know how to do this,\\nand just got swept up and went off to Vietnam and got maimed or killed. So I feel a bit of\\nsurvivor’s guilt for having manipulated the system, and I feel a little more smart for having done\\nit and taken a stand. And boy this doesn’t have much to do with pottery, except that it helped me\\ndecide that I was going to do something that had to do with human values that I thought were\\nimportant. And that’s maybe what goes into pottery.\\nAW: Well it sounds like it. You were just kind of describing that that was such a huge moment\\nfor you, realizing what you weren’t willing to do and what you wanted to see for your life and\\ncareer.\\nWS: Yeah, I guess we all make decisions in one way or another. For me part of it was I’m not\\ngoing to do this, I’m going to do this. It was a definite choice.\\nAW: And at such a young age too I think.\\nWS: At the same time my brother died. [Emotional] And I had this feeling that I could just do\\nwhatever, what the hell if life is not that long. Just do whatever you want.\\nAW: You guys must have been very close. What was his name?\\nJJ: Eldon. He was younger.\\nWS: Yeah, he was a couple years younger than I was. He was twenty-two and I was twenty-four\\nwhen he died. I’m sorry. It’s just too much emotion. He had testicular cancer. He was diagnosed\\nand died six months later. It was just a freakish sort of thing.\\n01:35:00\\nAW: Wow, he was so young.\\nJJ: Yeah.\\nWS: Anyway, I’m sorry I got lost in the emotion there and you can kind of remind me where I’m\\nat I guess.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n24\\nAW: Well, you were kind of talking about going to graduate school and pursuing a graduate\\nminor in ceramics—\\nWS: Oh yeah. So I did some work in ceramics. I took one class from Warren MacKenzie, which\\nhe didn’t remember for a long time that I was actually a student in his class, but he certainly had\\nan influence on me. Just seeing him working in the studio and going out to his studio and buying\\npots from him over the years. And seeing other people try to make a living making pots, that\\nseemed like something I would really like to do. I learned from other people in the studio arts\\ndepartment too, there was Curtis Hoard, who taught me how to throw pots on the wheel, and\\nTom Lane, he and I built a salt kiln together. Well, I was in a salt kiln building class, although\\nthere were only a couple of us who did much of the work. But there were good guides at glaze\\nmaking and pottery making, critical evaluation of your work and learning how to work. After\\nschool then, two or three years, I think I graduated and got my master’s degree in eighty-one and\\nI met Janel in eighty-four. I forget when the degree was actually granted. At that point I was still\\nworking in the city and making pots part-time as a hobby not having anywhere to fire them.\\nActually I continued to work at Fairview Hospital in the psych ward until 1985, where I was\\ndoing something called the Wilderness Treatment Program, where I used to take kids to the\\nBoundary Waters, which was the final project I worked on there.\\nAW: What was that like? You were describing most of your childhood and young adulthood was\\nin rural areas and farming areas, and then to go to Gustavus and then to move to the U of M,\\nwhich is a pretty big campus. What was that like for you to make that transition?\\nWS: After I’d been at Gustavus for two years, it wasn’t like coming there as a freshman, which\\nwould have been quite overwhelming. I think I was more ready for it after spending two years in\\na small town. Gustavus was just thirty-five miles from my hometown, at St. Peter. When I came\\nto the University [of Minnesota] then I had been in college, I had learned how to do college work\\nand I was involved in doing music in college. I kind of fit right into the University music\\nprogram doing a lot of singing. And I really got sucked into big university intramural athletics. I\\nused to play softball and football, racquetball and handball and ping pong (laughs)—we had all\\nthese intermural athletic things, which I loved doing athletic stuff but in a sense I did too much.\\nIt was hard for me to do everything and then do music. I belonged to a fraternity because I had a\\nhigh school friend who was in a fraternity and he recruited me to come and be in the fraternity\\nand perform in these things they would put on at school, these campus carnival events, musical\\nevents. We would create musicals from whole cloth, and put them on, perform them and try to\\nwin awards. It happened that I joined this fraternity that won the first prize award year after year\\nafter year so we had this tradition to hold up. So he recruited me to be a singer in this stuff, so I\\ndid that. There was a lot of distraction. My grades were okay but I wasn’t achieving much\\nacademically, I was kind of floundering around staying in school so I wouldn’t get drafted. That\\nwas part of it. I ended up taking many, many classes in different fields, history, sociology,\\npsychology; I just about have a psychology major. All because I wanted to continue to be a full-time\\nstudent.\\nAW: So, were you selling your pottery during that time before you met Janel?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n25\\nWS: I wasn’t. I made pots as a student. I did have a part-time job at a furniture store where we\\nbuilt unpainted furniture and a couple of times I had pottery from my classes and I brought them\\nin and put them on the shelves and they all disappeared within a week. So I knew that people\\nliked them and that they could be sold.\\nJJ: I don’t know that I knew that.\\n01:40:30\\nAW: So you weren’t selling them, you were just putting them up?\\nWS: No, I put them up for sale. I put them up and the family who owned the business said, “Why\\ndon’t we put them for sale?” So I did. I remember one of the first days somebody came in, some\\nyoung fellow who had just opened a new office or something, and he bought almost all of them\\nto decorate his office with or something. That was pretty reinforcing to me. I mean they were\\nnice simple pots, but anyway, that was a long time ago.\\nI think at that point I had bought a kit and built my own potter’s wheel that I had in my basement\\nin Minneapolis, but I didn’t have any place to fire the pottery so I was continuing to take some\\nclasses over at the University [of Minnesota] so I would have a place to fire pottery.\\nAW: Where did you live in Minneapolis?\\nWS: I lived in the Seward neighborhood the last few years I lived there, which is close to the\\nUniversity. Ironically, one block away from the Northern Clay Center. Where the Northern Clay\\nCenter is right now. It wasn’t there at that time.\\nAW: What was the ceramics, you described some of the people at the University of Minnesota,\\nbut what was the ceramics community like then?\\nWS: I think it was new. It seemed like I don’t know, as compared to what it is like today? It\\nseemed then like it was a world of possibilities. You could define your own work and go to the\\nlocal art fair and sell some things and maybe try and make a living. There were more art fairs\\nthat seemed newer and fresher than there are today.\\nAW: Did you go to those and ever sell there? Or did you go just to attend?\\nWS: I didn’t get into trying to sell to make a living really until I moved up here. I still had my\\njob working in the hospital. Janel had been involved in going to Duluth to the Park Point Show\\nand going to sell in St. Paul and, um—\\nJJ: St. Cloud.\\nWS: St. Cloud and small art fairs all around. She never drew a paycheck; she always made a\\nliving from her pottery. Then once I decided to try making a living we continued at the\\nRenaissance Fair for a few years. I kind of added on to what she was doing and that helped me\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n26\\nlearn how to make pots to sell, actually, because I’d make a lot of little dumpy coffee mugs and\\ntake them there and sell them for four dollars or two fifty I think they were at first—\\nJJ: Two seventy-five (or) four fifty, but not anymore!\\nWS: Because the Renaissance Festival started as a craft fair, not the entertainment event it is\\ntoday. It was a craft fair; that is what it was all about when it started. Now it’s a themed family\\nevent kind of.\\nJJ: Themed entertainment event.\\nWS: Yeah.\\nAW: So now there are a couple members of the [St. Croix Pottery] Tour, who were also at the\\nRenaissance Fair. Did you meet other people there?\\nWS: Well, Rick [Richard] Vincent was out there, that’s how we met him. And that’s how we\\nended up kind of recruiting him to be part of the Tour, because we already knew him and he had\\njust moved here, actually, from farther down in the cities.\\nJJ: Yeah, I don’t know his early story.\\nWS: Yeah, he was at the Renaissance Fair.\\nAW: Were there others?\\nWS: No, not in this group.\\nAW: So after you guys met, when did you decide to move here?\\nWS: Um, well I moved here in 1985.\\nJJ: We took a road trip in my Datsun pickup—\\nWS: To visit your dad in Arizona.\\nJJ: Yeah, to see if we could be in a confined space (laughs) together all the time, and it worked\\nout just fine.\\n01:45:00\\nWS: Was that in the spring of eighty-five? Before I moved in?\\nJJ: Yeah, it was March of eighty-five. You moved in in warmer weather I think.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n27\\nWS: And then in eighty-five I dropped my job. This grant I had to run this Wilderness Treatment\\nProgram ran out and my job ended and I stopped getting a paycheck and started making pottery\\nfor a living. Which always felt like an enormous risk after you were used to getting a paycheck\\nall the time.\\nJJ: Oh yeah. It still is a risk.\\nWS: So we haven’t had a paycheck for, what, almost thirty years now.\\nJJ: Um-hm.\\nWS: So then actually I started doing local craft fairs. The big one was the Minnesota Crafts\\nCouncil show at St. Catherine’s [University] in the summertime. We refer to it as St. Kate’s.\\nEverybody calls it the St. Kate’s Art Fair, but it was the Minnesota Crafts Council, which was a\\ngroup of craftspeople from around Minnesota that ran the show. Janel was part of the\\n[Minnesota] Crafts Council, she was vice-president at one point. This was a group that was\\nstarted years before by maybe Warren and someone else—\\nJJ: Yeah, I remember sitting in on early meetings when they were brainstorming about it.\\nWS: And then I was part of it and I think it might be where Bob and I actually met, but I’m not\\nsure. Bob Briscoe and I were at an annual meeting of the Crafts Council when, maybe, he first\\nmentioned that he might move up here. I don’t remember exactly it’s gotten to be too long ago.\\nBut we were aware of each other because we had pottery on consignment at a couple of shops in\\nMinneapolis and we might run into each other when we were delivering pottery or something.\\nSo, um, let’s see—\\nAW: Tell us a little bit about the Minnesota Crafts Council, how that got started.\\nWS: The Crafts Council was a lively group and they ran the St. Catherine Art Fair for years. This\\nis from the seventies on. Or did it start in the sixties? [Turns to Janel] You were involved in it\\nwhen I met you—\\nJJ: Yeah, I don’t remember exactly how it got started either, but I did become involved early.\\nThere was a different organization called the Midwest Artists’ Guild that started organizing a\\ncraft fair that took place at Mears Park for a few years. And then I think that that event became\\nthe St. Kate’s Art Fair, or in my mind, I went to one and that ended then I went to the other.\\nSomehow there was a time relationship between them and artists moved from one to the other\\nand artists were part of the group that ran and orchestrated those events. Otherwise, I can’t\\nremember the exact beginnings; I was pretty young then.\\nWS: By the time I got to it, the St. Kate’s Art Fair was the best art fair in Minnesota. We\\nconsidered it better than the Uptown Art Fair in terms that it was the best quality craft show. The\\nUptown Art Fair was this big gargantuan thing that would let anybody in—\\nJJ: It was also limited to craftsmen and not photography or painting.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n28\\nWS: Right. It wasn’t fine art it was craft materials. We ran that for years. I helped run it for a few\\nyears and then the [Minnesota] Crafts Council kind of disbanded. Most of us grew older and\\ndidn’t participate in the administration of it anymore. Anyway, that was the best show going in\\nMinnesota. Then, actually, when we stopped doing the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in 1992,\\nJanel had already started reaching out to some of the better craft shows in America. The\\nAmerican Craft Council shows—\\nJJ: The Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show, The Smithsonian Craft Show and some other\\nkinds of things.\\nWS: You had started doing those in the eighties—\\nJJ: With carved porcelain. And did those quite regularly.\\nWS: Then I started applying to some of those, like Philadelphia, I first did it in the early nineties\\nand have done it sixteen times since or something. Janel’s been at the Smithsonian Craft Show\\nmany times—\\nJJ: Ten times I think.\\nWS: Yeah, I don’t know. These are kind of the most selective craft shows in America. It’s\\nenabled us to build our audience nationally. Which hasn’t hurt the pottery tour either because we\\nspread the word about the pottery tour around the country.\\n01:50:20\\nAW: if I could follow up. I asked you a little bit about why you chose ceramics, but if you could\\ndescribe your approach to ceramics and how you define your approach and style.\\nWS: I think part of it is that my approach is around what I want to do. I want to make small\\ngroups of pots; I don’t want to make one hundred of something, I want to make ten or twelve of\\nsomething.\\nJJ: That’s a point of departure between us.\\nWS: Yeah, Janel will always say, “make forty of those while you’re doing it”. Because that’s\\nwhat she used to do at the Renaissance Fair. Make forty wine goblets.\\nJJ: Or a hundred (laughs).\\nWS: So, anyway, my pots are of fairly simple design. They are straightforward. If anything I’ll\\nsimplify a form rather than decorate it. I don’t decorate the pots other than the way the glaze\\nflows over the pot or the way the wood ash will lay on the pot. I might sprinkle something on the\\npot. Or the way the atmosphere in the kiln affects the pot. You might get some smoky carbon\\ntrapping going on over on the edges, which is different from the other sides. So it’s very subtle.\\nThe kind of pots I like to make are often called “quiet pots” in that they’re not decorated or they\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n29\\nmight be decorated by the process. They might still have my finger prints on them so that people\\ncan see that they are handmade. But I do spend more time trimming them sometimes. Most\\npotters will look at them and say, “these are tighter pots” because I’ve spent more time paring\\ndown the bottom so that the weight of the pot is a little bit lighter. I might have spent more time\\nthrowing them to get a nice smooth surface on the top. I want them to be useful; I want people to\\nenjoy using them and not be annoyed by them because the surface is rough or the edge is\\ncracking off or they’re so heavy that you can’t lift them in and out of the cupboard. I want them\\nto fit in the dishwasher. I want them to be enjoyable for people to use every day. I guess ideally I\\nwant people to reach in the cupboard and pick out the ones that I made because they know they\\nlike using them, you know? They’ve gotten used to them. Not that I want them to be boring. I\\ncould sometimes do more to make them interesting (laughs), but I kind of like the ones that are\\ncontemplative or something. People will look at them and say, “oh, that looks like a starry night\\nplate” or something because there’s almost no decoration except a few dots here or something\\nlike that. They can kind of project onto them what they see in them. As opposed to some startling\\nor obvious decoration, which I don’t do. It’s mostly about the forms for me, about simplifying\\nthe forms. I admire the kind of simplicity of some Scandinavian designs from the twentieth\\ncentury; clean kind of formative designs with all over color and texture.\\nBut I’m greatly influenced by our Minnesota history of MacKenzie’s English and Japanese\\ndesigned pottery making and hand making. Those are the pots I’ve lived with and used. At the\\nsame time I’m respectful of the tradition that Janel came from. The teacher she worked with\\ncame from the Bauhaus where things were very tight and almost industrial looking, designer-ly\\nkinds of things.\\nJJ: Not my pots necessarily but that’s the history.\\nWS: So I think any potter these days is aware of all of the different traditions and you kind of\\npick and choose. I like simple, quiet kinds of pots.\\nAW: So you said you met Bob probably during some of those Minnesota Crafts Council\\nmeetings?\\nWS: I think I remember at first, well do you remember when you met Bob?\\nJJ: I met Bob at the Park Point Art Fair, and they lived over in the Little Falls area. So our paths\\ndidn’t cross a lot.\\nWS: No.\\nJJ: But then they moved up here and we all became friends then.\\nWS: Well, but I knew him before he moved up here. Um—\\n01:55:15\\nAW: Actually that brings up another point. When you moved up here were there other potters?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n30\\nJJ: Oh yeah, okay. I just want to make a note here. Something to add that I should talk about at\\nsome point is the Bush Fellowship that I had in regards to my woodcarving. But that’s something\\nelse. When I first moved up here I approached Sunrise from North Branch and Jeff Oestreich’s\\naddress was Taylors Falls, and for me, not knowing how North Branch and Taylors Falls were\\nrelated to one another I thought Jeff lived far away. So I moved up here and at some point one or\\nthe other of us got in touch, and I was invited to Jeff’s house for dinner and he said, “well, turn\\nhere and turn here.” It was only seven miles away (laughs)! Other potters? Rich Abnet was there\\nmuch longer ago than either Jeff or I, and Warren MacKenzie also, but that’s down by Stillwater\\nand Marine [Marine On Saint Croix], so that’s a different neighborhood really. It was Jeff first\\nand then me and then Linda. Linda worked a little in Jeff’s studio and then got her space set up,\\nher first studio space set up over by Kost and then bought some property and built a house and\\nworked in the basement. You know her story probably. I’m not sure when Rick and Connee\\ncame into the area, but they weren’t there when I got here. Then Will came and Bob came and\\nthings moved forward for the [St. Croix Pottery] tour from that point. Jeff and I would have\\nspring and fall sales and we would occasionally try and do it on the same weekend and would\\nmake a note on our postcards of sales that, well, that I was having a sale and he was having a\\nsale. To try and encourage people to have two stops instead of one when they came up to the\\narea. And then Linda, Jeff and I created a brochure for the three of us that we put in tourist spots\\nand handed out to try and encourage, that was our marketing so to speak.\\n[Janel shows AW the first brochure]\\nAW: This is a great photo, it’s amazing!\\nWS: Yes, it’s hard to imagine who those people are these days. That was in the seventies.\\nAW: So early on you were trying to work and promote with each other?\\nJJ: Yeah. We’re an easy drive from the cities and it’s a nice day trip and a beautiful country. It\\nwas not like the Tour but it was trying to encourage people to come out, which is what the Tour\\nis doing.\\nWS: I guess the difference between that that I see, is that, and it sounds self-serving, but the\\ninitiative for the present day tour didn’t come from you guys, it came from Bob and I at a later\\ndate. If anything, Jeff and Linda were a little more reluctant to get involved in that, because they\\nwere busy selling pottery other places and teaching classes and doing other things.\\nJJ: They didn’t care to do art fairs. That was not the direction.\\nWS: And they weren’t sure they wanted to do sales with people who did art fairs either. There\\nwas just a different perception of who was doing what and what part of the art or craft world you\\nwere part of.\\nJJ: We all have different ways and make different choices.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n31\\nAW: So what led to the development of the Tour? Walk us through those early times.\\nWS: At some point, well I don’t remember and Bob probably told you this, exactly what year\\nthey moved up here. I don’t remember anymore.\\nJJ: Well, if you want to work backwards, the house was pretty new when we announced that\\nAvery was on his way and that was 1990. So they moved in during the late eighties.\\nWS: Anyway, at that point Bob and I had become friends. We had been on the Minnesota Crafts\\nCouncil board together and helped to run the St. Kate’s Art Fair. Certainly I have to give Bob\\ncredit for the initiative. It could have been me but it was probably he who said, “we’re all up\\nhere, you know, there are these potters close together, why don’t we have a sale together?” Jeff\\nOestreich, in particular, had had some very successful sales earlier years where people came to\\nhis house, and Janel had had sales here. I don’t know that Linda ever had sales at her house very\\nmuch, she might have, but not that we were involved in.\\n02:00:40\\nJJ: I think she had work in galleries more.\\nWS: Right. She would send pots off to St. Louis and Chicago.\\nSo, certainly the initiative was discussions between Bob and I around why don’t we have sales\\ntogether. Bob was fairly new to the area and basically he recruited Connee Mayeron. Bob had\\nbeen on the board at the starting of the Northern Clay Center and Connee was involved in that.\\nThey were both on the potters’ board. He had gotten to know her. Was she part of it [the St.\\nCroix Pottery Tour] the first year though? I’m not sure. Anyway, he recruited Connee and he had\\ngotten to know Warren.\\nJJ: Of the Tour?\\nWS: Yeah, the first year of the Tour. I guess she was.\\nAnyway, he recruited Connee and Warren and I recruited Jeff and Linda, Rick [Richard\\nVincent], and Richard Abnet. People that I knew from the area. She wasn’t was she?\\nJJ: [Consulting notes] No, it was the second year [that Connee joined the Tour].\\nWS: Yeah I think Connee came on board the second year of the Tour.\\nAnd Warren, well, Bob talked with Warren. I’ve never gotten to know Warren all that well. I’m\\nvery friendly with him but I haven’t sought him out. I always felt like sort of a brown nose. So\\nmany people are wanting Warren’s attention, I’m not going to be one of them, or whatever.\\nThat’s just my nature. Not that there is anything wrong with Bob doing that. Bob got to be very\\nfriendly with Warren and convinced him that he could support us and be part of this, which he\\ndid in the sense that he opened his studio. But then the rules we had made for being there and\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n32\\nmeeting people, Warren wasn’t able to follow that. He was hardly ever there during the time of\\nthe Tour, so it didn’t work out all that well and people were disappointed that he wasn’t there.\\nEven though they anticipated going to his place. That was kind of a conflict, so after three years\\nWarren wasn’t a part of it anymore. That was fine, he didn’t need us certainly, he was just trying\\nto help us out. Since then the group has stayed the same, except for when Richard Abnet died.\\nRichard Abnet was somebody I had known from years ago. I met him at art fairs and talked with\\nhim.\\nJJ: Well then we added Guillermo. He had been a guest at Linda’s for a few years and then\\nmoved into the area and we all were very happy to--\\nWS: Well he had been a guest for three years.\\nJJ: Right, right. To accept him as another host.\\nWS: And he had this amazing history. He’s run a show like this for fourteen years in South\\nAmerica, in Venezuela. So he was a great addition to the whole idea with his enthusiasm about\\npottery.\\nAW: So in those early years, as you were getting the group together, why did people just, you\\nkind of describe people just knowing people—\\nWS: Well I think Janel and I knew Jeff and Linda. And I, and to a certain extent Janel too, knew\\nRick [Richard] Vincent. I had met him actually at an art fair years before I had some pots I\\nbought from him and I admired what he did. Rich Abnet I had met at the Har Mar Shopping Mall\\nat an art fair years before selling pots. I’d stopped at his house and visited from time to time. So\\nit was our knowing Rich Abnet and Rick Vincent to a certain extent, enough to ask them to want\\nto be part of this and to kind of talk them into it. Everybody had their own approach, everybody\\nhad their own doubts about it. Linda and Jeff, I think, had real doubts about whether they wanted\\nto embark in some kind of crass marketing event, you know? They were into selling their pots at\\ngalleries and teaching workshops and the whole idea of kind of an art fair situation didn’t appeal\\nto them very much. Everybody had their own approach and came from a different world. As\\nmuch as the outside world sees pottery as all the same, each one of us has a different lifestyle in\\npottery. We all sell our pots in different places and we have different customers and different\\nways of putting it out there. I mean Jeff Oestreich is an internationally known potter, he’s quite a\\ncelebrity, as is Linda Christianson in her own way.\\n02:05:50\\nJJ: That’s part of what makes it so compellingly interesting for people to attend. Having guests,\\nthere’s a little concern on some of our parts that not enough new guests have been on the roster\\nover the years.\\nWS: That’s a current concern.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n33\\nJJ: Yeah. It’s slowed down. The turnover. It’s so hard to say, “you can’t be here anymore” after\\nsuccess has happened. It’s real tricky. And the group had made the decision to limit to eight\\nguests, or seven guests?\\nWS: It’s a limit, but it’s huge. It’s almost kind of a joke. I mean eight people plus the host, so\\nthat’s nine artists at each location. No customer can possibly go and visit sixty-three people. You\\ncan’t visit every one and buy something from them.\\nJJ: Well it’s been fifty-two at the most so far.\\nWS: There are seven locations, so if there were nine people at each location it would be sixty-three.\\nIt’s not yet, but it could be.\\nJJ: Oh, you mean theoretically.\\nWS: It’s fifty, fifty-one right now. Anyway, one of our current concerns is keeping it fresh and\\nhaving new artists come in from time to time.\\nJJ: You know, I am a sounding board for when Will is considering who to ask. This year the\\nconversation hadn’t been had with some of the people who reached their third year this year.\\nUltimately, with much anguish throughout the whole show, Will finally ended up inviting them\\nback for next year.\\nWS: When I invite people, I invite them for three years at a time. That’s just our policy. Every\\nstudio does their own thing. They can invite them [the guest potters] for as long or as little as\\nthey want.\\nJJ: But he had also already invited a couple of other artists for next year so in the end we are\\ngoing to have more artists here than ever before.\\nWS: We are going to have eight guests next year.\\nJJ: So there won’t be room for me as a potter by the numbers, if I wanted to be a potter for next\\nyear, but I bet I could sweet talk the group into it (laughs).\\nWS: Janel has taken, two or three years in particular, and spent two or three weeks or so making\\npottery and then being on the list of potters, and then people would know they could come and\\nfind pots by Janel. She did it last year [in 2013].\\nJJ: It depends if I go to the Smithsonian Craft Show, which happens just a few weeks before the\\nTour. When I have that I have really not enough time to make a good body of work and I need to\\nbe focused on carving the wood pieces.\\nWS: So we’ve already kind of decided we won’t do it next year.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n34\\nJJ: Yeah, because of our number of artists. And that’s fine because I’ve got some work I want to\\nbe doing aside from clay work.\\nWS: The initial getting people involved was probably the most interesting part of the whole\\nshow, when I think back on it. I think about my approach to Rick Vincent, for example, and what\\nhe would think of it and Rich Abnet, who was not easy to convince. He was a curmudgeon.\\nJJ: But he did well. He never had guest artists but he did very well there.\\nWS: Oh yeah. He did great. He was a productive potter who always had hundreds and hundreds\\nof pots. What else can you have when people show up? You know you want to have a lot of\\nwork to offer them.\\nJJ: Having new artists keeps it, I think, makes it more interesting. The concept, anyway, that\\nthere will be something new to look at. It’s not that it’s the same ol’, same ol’ every time; people\\nlike to be able to count on seeing things again and it sometimes takes two or three years for\\nsomeone to actually want to start taking pots home. It’s also up to the guest potter a little bit if\\nthey want to stay past the first year.\\n02:10:25\\nWS: The original asking people to come, it was the fifth year that we invited guests to come.\\nAnd most of the original guests that we had were local or regional potters.\\nJJ: It was 1997 [that guest potters were first invited to sell at the Tour].\\nWS: We invited someone from Minnesota to come, some potters from Duluth. Gail Kendall was\\nhere, who was teaching at Macalester at the time. They were regional guests. Going beyond that,\\nI think Bob and I we would talk about the show year round, whenever we’d get together we’d\\nsay, “what if we did this, and what if we did this.” Then we had the experience of going out to an\\ninvitational in New York City, or in New Jersey actually, in Demarest, New Jersey, which Bob\\nmaybe mentioned in his ramblings. It was an invitational event that was a benefit for an arts\\ncenter. They had potters from all over the United States coming and it was great. The quality of\\nthe pottery was really great. The support of the event wasn’t all that great; they worked for years\\nand years and years to get beyond fifty thousand dollars’ worth of sales. Then they thought\\nmaybe they’d get to a hundred thousand.\\nWhen we started having guests years later we went way past all that. Our sales were much\\ngreater than this event that we were really kind of modeling after out East. Our audience was, in\\nthat sense, better than the New York City audience. Or we were better at getting them here or\\nsomething. But I think it was seeing that event out in New Jersey that was an invitational. It\\nwasn’t an art fair where you sent in a juried slide or something; it was potters meeting other\\npotters and deciding, “hey, I really like what you’re doing and I think my customers would really\\nlike seeing what you’re doing, so why don’t you come and sell your pots at my house?” Which, a\\nlot of people right away told us, “well, you won’t sell as much if you bring people in”. Of course,\\nthat’s not what happened at all. What happened was the whole thing just got bigger and bigger\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n35\\nand bigger. We got many, many more people to come and we sold a lot more pottery. That’s sort\\nof the bottom line on inviting guests.\\nAW: Why do you think that helps the Tour? Why do you think that helped it grow?\\nWS: Well it gave us a status. We’re known as the show somewhere in the United States where\\npeople get selected from around the country to come there and be part of that show. It’s so good\\nthat they can pick the best potters from around the country and they’ll go there and they’ll sell\\nmore than they sell anywhere else. You know, they will sell more there than they’ll sell at any art\\nfair or maybe even at their own studios sometimes.\\nJJ: And because there is such a great variety between each of the studios in the experience that\\nthey have there and with the potters that they see there, if there were seven studios and only one\\npotter in each studio and it didn’t change from year to year, people could choose to go\\nsomewhere else do something because they’d have already seen it. We don’t change that much,\\nbut to have so many different potters it becomes a very appealing event to come and see. You\\nknow you are going to see new things, you may see the same people, but everybody all together\\nmoves forward with what they are doing and it just becomes a great destination; an idea place\\nand a place to get things to bring into their lives.\\nWS: It is about ideas and about people too. We always stress that if a potter comes here to show\\ntheir work and to sell their work, they have to make themselves available. We want them to be\\nthere as if people are coming to visit their own studio. We want it to feel like an open house. We\\ndon’t want them to be busy doing sales or being otherwise involved.\\nJJ: Each of the potters have people who come and beeline right for them first, because they want\\nto see their work. And then there are people who see friends that they’ve made out of the\\ncustomers that they’ve met here. So there is a lot of human interaction, a lot of social sharing.\\n02:15:15\\nWS: And some of that is the nature of the pottery. If you drink your daily coffee out of a mug\\nthat you bought from somebody last year at the pottery tour, then you’re going to be glad to see\\nthem again. It’s a connection of the product as well as the person. The other part of that, of\\ncourse, is that it’s ceramics. It’s only ceramics, it’s only pottery; it’s not painting, photography\\nand sculpture. If you are somebody who is interested in pottery, you’re going to go there and see\\na wealth of really good pottery. There’s nowhere else you can see it, there really isn’t. Maybe\\ntoday at the Northern Clay Center you can go and see little vignettes or groups of pottery from\\nall over the United States. That never existed when we started doing this. Here you can go and\\nsee three hundred pots by one person and talk to them, and they’re someone who has been\\nselected from the other side of the country to come here and bring their work. It’s a preselected\\ngroup of people and it’s only pottery.\\nAW: So, who have been your guests in the past and how have you decided? Do you have criteria\\nfor who you are looking for and why you decide to invite certain people?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n36\\nWS: Well, our first guests were the Husby’s who are this energetic couple from Duluth who have\\nmade pots for decades and who have been known in the Minnesota arts community. He has\\ntaught at the University [of Minnesota] and she’s someone who has organized all sorts of arts\\nevents in Duluth.\\nJJ: She’s a mover and shaker up in Duluth. She’s great.\\nAW: How did you meet them?\\nJJ: Well, let’s see. She called me to do a telephone interview when she was doing graduate work.\\nWS: I met her before I met you at a pottery workshop she was helping to administer, way, way\\nback when. I don’t know if she was even making pottery then, but she was involved in the arts.\\nAW: And what’s her name?\\nWS: Cheryl [and Bob] Husby. C-H-E-R-Y-L H-U-S-B-Y. They were our first guests. They were\\nchosen because they were close by and they were energetic, not because their pottery was my\\nfavorite. It never has been. They’re great, but I like other people’s pottery better than what they\\nmake. I shouldn’t say that—I shouldn’t put that on tape! (Laughs)\\nThen the next year we invited Malcolm Davis, who is from Washington D.C., who eventually\\ngot kind of a national reputation for what he did. He was very well known for teaching\\nworkshops. We met him at the Smithsonian Craft Show in Washington D.C. that Janel was doing\\nwith her porcelain. And we stayed at his house.\\nJJ: He had such a wonderful, interesting, complex personality. We so enjoyed him. As a side\\nnote, that was the year I came down with pneumonia. It was the week of the Tour, and Will\\ncouldn’t take me in. Finally I went in on Wednesday and saw the first doctor but he sent me\\nhome. My heart was pounding and everything and I had a high fever and on Friday a different\\ndoctor said, “go to the hospital, you have pneumonia.”\\nWS: So that weekend you spent in the hospital.\\nJJ: Yeah, and that night there was a tornado in the region and it knocked out our electricity. Will\\nhad to un-stack the kiln and Avery was very young, he was six at the time. So I said, “can you\\nget a neighbor to help?” So we called some neighbors--\\nWS: They brought water down, you know, their water wells were working and ours wasn’t. We\\ncouldn’t flush our toilets and we had a thousand people coming.\\nJJ: Malcolm was going to stay at our house but he decided, “no, I’m not going to go in that\\nhouse.” So he stayed over with Jeff [Oestreich].\\nWS: He didn’t want to get pneumonia. Then a couple years later he ended up being Jeff’s guest\\nover at Jeff’s house.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n37\\nWS: So, over the years we’ve recruited more people from far away to come here. People who are\\nreally outstanding potters from other parts of the country. Malcolm Davis, in particular, then the\\nnext year we had Steven Hill, who at the time was sort of a star. He had his picture on the front\\nof Ceramics Monthly magazine. He’s from Kansas City and he was making beautiful pots, so we\\ninvited him to come here. The next year we had Steven again and a fellow from Connecticut who\\nmade spectacular pots that people had never seen in Minnesota before.\\nJJ: Yeah, thin slab hand-built.\\nWS: But he had some history here, he had gone to school at the University of Minnesota.\\nJJ: His name was Hayne Bayless.\\n02:20:20\\nWS: Anyway, the next year we repeated some of those people. A couple years later we had some\\npeople from Philadelphia that no one here had ever seen that I had met on my travels to this\\nshow in New Jersey. For a long time we weren’t very good about focusing on people from\\nMinnesota. We wanted to bring in somebody to our customers that they had never seen before.\\nThat was part of what I was thinking anyway. We did the same thing in 2004, a couple of years\\nlater. We invited Mark Shapiro and Sam Taylor, who are people I met on the East coast. They\\nlive in Massachusetts and make beautiful pots. They were here for a couple of years, and now\\nthey are here again. They were gone for a few years and now they’ve been here for several years\\nagain. The same thing happened with two women, Ellen Shankin and Silvie Granatelli, that\\nwe’ve had now for several years in a row. I met them in New Jersey, too, and kind of approached\\nthem like a—\\nJJ: In New Jersey?\\nWS: At Demarest. At the Demarest Art Fair, at the invitational show. When I approached them I\\nthought, these ladies make spectacular pots. They’re never going to want to come to Minnesota.\\nBut they immediately said, “of course! We’ve heard all about it.” So that’s been really\\nreinforcing. People now know and they sell, Ellen will sell twice as many pots as I will. She’s a\\nspectacular designer and producer of handmade things. And she plans ahead, she’s a really\\ndiligent worker; she shows up with four hundred pots, whereas somebody else will have two\\nhundred. She’s just really ready and she goes home with buckets full of money. People come\\nhere to see her now probably more than they come to see me. She sells more pots than I do.\\nJJ: And Silvie too. She has a limited inventory of wonderful, wonderful pots. So if you want\\ncertain pots you have to be there early. It’s fun. It’s fun to watch people come to see their potters\\nand have wonderful conversations and go home with armloads of pots. It’s so gratifying to have\\nthis kind of venue to have so many potters have a successful experience.\\nAW: And how do you guys work with the guest artists? Do they stay here? What is kind of your\\nprocess a few days before the Tour opens?\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n38\\nWS: We haven’t had anybody stay here for a couple of years now. We’ve actually had our house\\nalmost empty. Except for maybe a helper; Nancy might stay over or if Avery is here he might\\nstay.\\nJJ: Yeah, we had them a little bit stay over, but over time other choices have been made. Mark\\nand Sam stay down at Sam’s auntie’s house in Afton [Minnesota] and the ladies stay up the road\\nat a bed and breakfast that we first put them in because, well, we have just one bathroom and\\nWill is uneasy about having a group of people share one bathroom.\\nWS: Well, it’s okay. It just makes for more stress. Having more and more and more people in the\\nhouse and you have to make breakfast for everybody.\\nJJ: So the bed and breakfast is a log cabin and the bathroom is in an outhouse-style building, but\\nit’s heated and it’s got a shower and toilet. It’s very nice, so they stay there every time. And\\nanother guest gets a room at an AmericInn [in North Branch, MN].\\nWS: So that actually works nicely for us. It reduces the stress. I know Bob and Mary- Bob\\nprobably talked about this- over the years they had more and more people staying at their house,\\nand they still have some, but it’s helped them a lot to kind of say, “wait a minute, this is way too\\nmuch.”\\nJJ: So it depends on how far back you want to go in our preparations for the Tour. We kind of\\nstart after the Philadelphia show. I do the website because by then almost everybody has got their\\nimages in, even though they are supposed to be in by September. There are a few always\\ndragging their feet. Will knuckles down with the poster and gets that done before the end of the\\nyear so we can have that out in places. Then we both get to work on what we need to do of our\\nown things. In February we start baking cookies every Sunday until we have accomplished at\\nleast the five batches. This year it totaled about thirty four hundred. Then I start baking banana\\nbread and get several batches of that made and our freezers are solid filled with baked goods.\\nLast year we had somebody make gluten-free cookies and she had six hundred last year and\\nalmost tripled it this year [2014] to about fifteen hundred.\\nAnyway, we had a lot more baked goods ready. The audience [in 2014] was just a little lower so\\nwe ended up having some cookies left. When we’re done with that we work again on preparing.\\nWhen I get back from the Smithsonian everything else needs to get ready. I make food for the\\ngroup, which is a large number of people, for three days. The ladies organize with the other guest\\npotters one night’s dinner with soup, so we don’t have to worry about having a communal\\ndinner. The other nights we go somewhere else, to Connee’s house or to Bob’s where dinner is\\nprovided.\\n02:26:30\\nWS: I think each group we do this we do dinner on Saturday night. I think at each location\\nthey’ve evolved their own kind of cultural habits or routines, having dinner and what kind of\\nfood they prepare. We do a lot, and everybody feels like they do a lot.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n39\\nJJ: So we put out all the cookies and breads, cold milk, lemonade, coffee and hot water for tea.\\nAnd then in the clay room we have set up the small refrigerator with whatever we can fit in there\\nand several coolers and a crockpot with something hot and then cheese and meat, vegetables and\\nfruit and whatever else anybody brings.\\nWS: But that’s for our potters, not for all the customers.\\nJJ: That’s true, but for me it’s part of the preparation for the show. It’s all work that’s got to get\\ndone and it’s not income producing. It’s to help make the event succeed and make everybody\\nhappy and it’s just the way it is.\\nWS: Looking back, though, on the history, this has all gotten to be bigger and bigger and bigger.\\nAll the food, all the cookies in particular, and all the baking; it’s all much bigger than it was\\nyears and years and years ago. Now it takes a lot of planning and preparation.\\nJJ: Yeah, but it isn’t like what Bob and Mary did.\\nAW: It does seem like that is an important part of the Tour, is the providing of some kind of\\nfood—\\nJJ: There aren’t many places for someone to stop for something quick.\\nWS: When we got this group together, we said, “we want this to be like an open house; we want\\nit to be just like your best open house when you invite people to come to your studio and see\\nwhere you work and what your life is about in pottery.” Because we all understand that we make\\nthis stuff by hand. If people are going to buy it they want to connect with you, you know, they\\nwant to take a little piece of you home. So the whole idea is to make it easy for them to connect\\nwith you, to see where you live. How many times have people gotten out of their cars and said,\\n“geez, I’d like to live out in the country and make pottery,” or heard that sort of vicarious thing\\nfrom customers. That’s the thing we want to build on over the years. For the first few years I\\nwould always remind people and say, “Remember this is not just a pottery sale. You’re not just\\nsetting this up so people can come give you the money and go home. You want them to connect\\nwith you otherwise they’ll never come back.” That was my thinking about it. And that’s part of\\nthe cookies and part of the having potters there enforcing the idea that they are there to talk to\\npeople. That they can’t disappear, they can’t go watch T.V. or something while the sale is going\\non. They have to be there. You have to bring your friends to help with the sales so you can meet\\nthe customers.\\nJJ: We ask each potter to bring a helper, so the husbands and wives come. In this case the\\nhusbands are the helpers, oh and Karin [Kraemer], she brings her husband, but she also brings\\nhelpers on different days, which has been wonderful for me because always one of them has\\nhelped me with the tallying. And the helpers are wonderful to get to know. It’s just a huge people\\nweekend that starts on Thursday and ends suddenly on Sunday night, when they go out the door\\nand then I feel like I just haven’t had enough time to be with the people that we care about that\\nhave come to be together.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n40\\n02:30:15\\nWS: The potters you mean?\\nJJ: Yeah, the potters. It just goes by so fast.\\nWS: Well I always try to focus on welcoming the people in. Bob’s overwhelming success and\\nhis kind of, I think people think of the pottery tour they sometimes think about Bob Briscoe’s\\nbecause he’s got beer and food and wine. It’s all about hospitality for him. He just wants to pile\\non the hospitality and have people have a good time, like he’s having a party. In fact he does, on\\nFriday night. The pottery sale goes on and then people stay and they have a party on Friday\\nnight. He’s been an example for many of the other people. And for us, to a certain extent and\\neven for Connee, who started giving people popcorn or something. At first it was kind of\\nhesitant, like, oh, we should feed them something? (laughs) Now Guillermo’s feeding everyone\\nand Linda fed everyone and now we have food trucks. So it’s changed and evolved over the\\nyears. And it will probably continue to change and I hope we continue to keep in mind why\\nwe’re doing it. It’s for the experience the people have, not just the fact that they leave some\\nmoney in your pocket. Otherwise they won’t come back. The other thing, though, that we didn’t\\ntalk about very much—\\nJJ: We didn’t get through our guest list, either, but I don’t know if that’s important.\\nWS: Well, we did kind of. Our guests basically all came from far afield until a couple of years\\nago. Until I started inviting some people from Minnesota with the idea that, duh, there are some\\npeople in Minnesota who have been here for decades that have great mailing lists (laughs). They\\ncould help us by giving us their mailing lists and bringing their customers to us. You know, we\\nshouldn’t just be bringing people from the outside.\\nJJ: And a little bit of a conscious decision to try and include a younger potter--\\nWS: Younger potters too, yeah.\\nJJ: --that have some establishment so far, or have been established a little bit. Because we are all\\naging and none of us exactly know where the Tour is going to be going. It is great to see that\\nthere are younger potters finding their way into the scene in the region. It’s good to recognize\\nthat. We have one who is not young, young, but he is not our age, Ernest Miller.\\nWS: Well, he’s forty or something.\\nJJ: Well, he’s twenty years younger than we are.\\nAW: How did you meet Ernest?\\nWS: I saw him at an art fair somewhere. I saw his work and thought what’s he doing at this\\ncrappy art fair. He makes beautiful pottery, then I talked to him and went to visit him at his\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n41\\nstudio and got the sense that he’s trying to make a life in clay. That’s the kind of person I want to\\ninvite.\\nJJ: I met his work but not him when I was on a McKnight or Jerome; I think it was the McKnight\\npanel, many years ago.\\nWS: Yeah, so you saw his resume?\\nJJ: Yeah, I saw his work and his resume.\\nAW: It sounds like a lot of the guest artists you have you met at art fairs.\\nWS: Yeah, I guess so.\\nJJ: Yes, when their pots are out. Through seeing their pots, yeah. Mostly you, but I might point\\nsomeone out once in a while. Will is the one who is mostly balancing everything.\\nWS: Well I tend to invite people who are really trying to make this work for themselves. For the\\nmost part they are not college professors; they don’t have another income. They are usually\\nsomebody who is trying to make a life working in clay, whether they are making functional pots\\nor sculpture or whatever it is they are doing, they are committed to it. And I think our customers\\nwould appreciate that. I guess the other part I feel like I should mention in some way is that Janel\\nand I have both been extremely involved in the operating of this thing from day one. We’ve\\npassed some of it around from years to years, other people have done various parts of it, and then\\nwe’ve taken parts of it back. Janel, when we did the website, launched into being the person who\\ncreated the website and she still does it today. We hand drew the maps to start with and collected\\nall the photos, arranged the printing and distributed all the fliers. We still do all that. We still do\\nthe fliers, although, for some years Bob Briscoe did it, for like six years, with his friend Jessie,\\nand Linda [Christianson] did it for a few years. Now we’re back to doing it again. The mailing\\nlist is a really big job, and now Guillermo and his wife Laurie help with that. They collect some\\nof the names and then we put it all together.\\n02:35:40\\nJJ: You put it together.\\nWS: Yeah, well there used to be this horrible job of visually looking through the mailing list to\\npick out the duplicates.\\nJJ: That was my job.\\nWS: Yeah you did that at one point, Bob and Mary did it once, Linda did it once. Everybody did\\nit, and then we realized, this could be done by computer. So these days it’s done by computer.\\nJJ: Yeah, modern mailing services are great.\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n42\\nWS: So we’ve eliminated that, because we sent out thirty-eight thousand last year.\\nJJ: And that’s after all the duplicates [have been removed].\\nWS: Well let’s see, that’s not right. We printed thirty-nine thousand last year and sent out thirty\\nor thirty-one thousand. We sent about fifteen thousand outside the state of Minnesota, and about\\nfifteen thousand inside the state of Minnesota. That’s the combined mailing list that happens\\nevery year; it starts over we put all the mailing lists together and try to eliminate the six or seven\\nthousand duplicates.\\nJJ: Yeah, and that was one of my missions, to impress upon the fact that this job actually needs\\nto be done because the posters cost money and at that time it was just seven mailing lists being\\ncombined. If someone was on all seven mailing lists, they would get that many and that’s\\nannoying. You don’t want to annoy the customers. And we wanted to save some money. So\\noriginally I’d organize it by last name and then by address and just visually separate out all but\\none.\\nWS: Remember Linda had a broken leg once, or surgery on her knee, and she laid in bed and\\nsorted through all the things one year (laughs).\\nJJ: Yeah, what a job. Now there are companies that can just put it all in together and correct the\\naddresses and send everything back.\\nWS: All the tasks that run the Tour have never been distributed equally. We’ve always done\\nmore of our share, certainly, and some people do little to help but lend advice and support. That’s\\njust been accepted over the years as the way that it works. In order to work people have to do\\nwhat they are used to doing to get it done. I’m not complaining when I say that, I’m just pointing\\nout the fact that it’s worked the way it is. I don’t think it would work if we tried to split\\neverything up and have everybody do an equal job somehow.\\nAW: Do you think people’s roles and tasks that they are doing have kind of fallen to what they\\ndo well or what they’ve been able to handle? Because certain tasks have been passed to different\\npeople for a time, but then—\\nWS: Absolutely.\\nJJ: Yeah, we’ve learned to do those things well. If somebody took on a job and got over the “I\\ndon’t want to do this” part, maybe they would learn to do the job well also. But it’s really hard to\\nactually tell someone that it’s changing.\\nWS: At this point it’s much harder to show or tell somebody how to do something that you are\\nalready doing, or it seems like it is. It kind of goes on from year to year with people saying,\\n“well, let’s everybody do what they did last year.” You know? And it works.\\nJJ: Sometimes, and I can’t remember what inspired the answer from what question, but part of\\nwhat makes the Tour work, people from elsewhere ask “how can we set up our own thing [tour\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n43\\nevent]?” One of the things that works for us is that we have a meeting once a year after the event\\nand we talk about the successes and failures and brainstorm about what else needs to be\\nconsidered or what else to add or eliminate. Looking ahead a couple years, now we’ve got our\\ntwenty-fifth anniversary coming up. We’re not working hard on it yet but the ideas are falling\\ninto place. But it’s a respectful meeting where we value what each other has to say about all the\\nthings being considered.\\nWS: Over the years, well, in earlier years some people would say, “well, I don’t know how much\\nlonger I want to do this.” And then somebody else would say, “Well, why can’t we just do it on\\nSunday instead of on Friday, Saturday and Sunday?” There were always ideas coming up but\\nwe’ve always kind of weathered through those and made it just a little bigger and better over the\\nyears without making bad decisions. Somehow most of the decisions we made seem to have\\nworked and they’ve kept the group together.\\n02:40:50\\nJJ: By reaching a consensus.\\nWS: Yeah, just as a friendly consensus. Not everybody always agreed, but they would agree to\\ngo along if they didn’t and nobody quit. (Laughs)\\nAW: Were there ever any tense moments or tough decisions? What have been some of the\\nchallenges that the Tour has faced?\\nJJ: Well, those that lobbied to have one day instead of two, because mother’s day was a problem\\nfor them. I mean they wanted to spend it with their mothers. Adding Friday and making it a\\nthree-day event—\\nWS: Yeah, adding Friday. Bob and I wanted to add Friday several years before the group agreed\\nto do it.\\nJJ: And it’s been a very important addition and everybody I think sees that.\\nWS: Initially in the early years it wasn’t totally easy to get everybody to share their mailing lists.\\nJJ: And have them be updated.\\nWS: Yeah, and to have them updated. We had to point out to people how important that is. Every\\nperson on a mailing list is probably somebody who is interested in what you are doing. If you\\ndon’t use that list, every time you go out to a street art fair you’re just looking for every one of a\\nhundred people who are interested, or one in a thousand. So you have this great list of people\\nwho are already interested. You gotta really focus on that.\\nJJ: Some sticky situations occur, one artist committed two different years and because of a\\nphysical ailment or inability to be ready because of physical things or things happening with the\\nkiln couldn’t participate but the name was on the poster and so forth. Trying to decide, do we\\nA Measure of the Earth Oral Histories\\nW. Swanson and J. Jacobson\\n06/30/14\\n44\\ngive the money back or does his payment stand. And then when a husband and wife bring their\\nwork, is there a distinction between his and hers or is it a unified work, and do we charge for one\\nor two. Those things are kind of grey discussion areas that we have to deal with one case at a\\ntime.\\nWS: The biggest change we made, actually, in the early years everyone paid, in terms of the\\norganization of it, on a percentage basis. I’m sure other people might have remembered this and\\ntold you; I’m sure Bob [Briscoe] doesn’t forget it. I guess maybe through 2003 or 2004\\neverybody paid on a percentage basis based on how much they sold. At the time I was being\\ntreasurer also, and everybody would call me and say how much they sold for the whole weekend,\\nand then I would figure a percentage and say, “our expenses for the year were six thousand\\ndollars, so your percentage of that is this because you sold so much.” Well, it became a\\ndisincentive because we have some people, whose names shall go mentionless, who wouldn’t\\nprepare for this show like they could, and they wouldn’t sell very much because then they didn’t\\nhave to pay very much. But it certainly didn’t help the overall event to look very good, because\\nsome people didn’t have many pots. Then the people who would prepare the most would end up\\npaying for the whole thing because they’d have really good sales. Bob Briscoe, in particular,\\nwith his marketing and enthusiasm would sell really well, and he’d end up paying this enormous\\namount compared to what some other people paid because they just didn’t take time or have time\\nto make enough pots. So, at some point we said, “duh. Why don’t we charge everybody a share,\\nhave everybody pay one share, and that way they’re going to be paying the same percentage as\\neverybody else of the total expenses and they’ll have an incentive to bring a lot of good pots.\\nAnd then we eventually did this for our guests also, so every host and every guest pays the same\\nshare. This has worked really well for us. The only people who suffer at all are the ones who\\nmaybe are new here so don’t sell quite as well. But our expenses still end up being maybe twenty\\npercent of their overall sales.
